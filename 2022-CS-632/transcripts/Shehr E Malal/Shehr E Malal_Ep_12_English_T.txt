[6.76] I instructed Rameen to send the
car and the driver to pick you up.
[10.38] It's not like that.
We came very comfortably in the taxi.
[13.45] Yes, of course.
[14.05] Oh, Auntie, you must've travelled
in wagons and taxis.
[18.00] But this would be the first time
for Mehr-un-Nisa, no?
[20.12] She must've been inconvenienced.
[22.05] There's jewelry
worth 5 crores here.
[24.24] Don't forget this
and remember your promise.
[29.59] It's just... Hina...
[34.13] Actually, Hina, I was thinking that...
[70.23] Mehru!  what are you doing?
[74.58] Please.
[92.58] Don't do this, Mehru.
[194.03] What palaces have you built, what
[195.81] factories did you start that you
took such a hefty loan from the bank?
[198.95] Nana gave you everything along
with his daughter and what did you do?
[205.54] I won't go until he answers my questions.
Why did he do this with you?
[211.03] What difference does it
make if she said all this?
[213.66] I trust you blindly.  Isn't that enough?
[217.73] Please forget everything she said.
[234.00] This is what I wanted.
[238.03] Is your love hiding behind all this hatred?
[242.77] My love was buried a long time ago...
[245.78] when he left me because of my status.
[249.14] Your revenge is done now!
[251.54] Leave Umar and his wife be.
[255.13] Your daughter-in-law lost jewelry
worth crores.  Don't you care about that?
[260.59] No, I...
[262.27] I know it's a huge loss,
[263.82] but I don't want to say anything to Rameen
and upset Shahzar.
[269.57] Let everything run how it is.
We'll see it later.
[272.98] Shahnawaz suspects that Rameen stole
the jewellery in order to help her parents.
[279.63] You should prove it somehow.
[282.89] I don't have any evidence for this.
Where will I get it from?
[285.48] Oh, is it hard for you to create evidence?
[290.31] Be patient.
[292.44] Let them shift to the rented house
then we'll see what to do.
[295.67] I'll have to think about it.
[342.91] - Salam.
- Walaikum Salam.
[350.09] Congratulations!  You got the job, right?
[352.80] How do you know?
[354.62] I figured it out by your mood.
I'm so happy!
[358.27] what is this?
[359.70] -A car.
- No, I mean, is anyone here?
[363.18] Umar...
[365.06] this is for you.
[367.63] What?
[370.84] You bought it?
But where do you get the money from?
[374.29] Oh my God, Omar!  It's not that expensive.
I saw an ad for it, it's used.
[379.56] - So when I saw the ad... -
But still.
[382.75] I saw the ad in the newspaper
so I thought why not?
[386.34] But what I don't understand is you...
[396.31] You sold the furniture?
[400.29] But why, Mehru?  It was everything
you liked.
[404.33] You decorated the house with your own hands.
You brought every single thing here,
[407.89] you liked everything, then?
[410.58] Umar, I am being practical.
[412.44] We're moving to a smaller house.  Where
were we going to fit such heavy furniture?
[418.17] God is willing, if we get another chance,
we'll buy it all again.
[422.30] But still, man.  I don't know but I don't
like it.  You shouldn't have done this.
[426.41] And I didn't like you traveling
in rickshaws.
[429.98] We needed a car right now,
not furniture.
[435.86] Please don't worry.
[438.26] How many times do I have to say good times will
come and very soon, God is willing.
[446.87] You're impossible.
[450.75] Thank you.
[452.30] Why are you being so formal
with thank you and all that?
[455.02] Go and freshen up.  I've made
your favourite food, mutton pulao.
[458.65] Oh, so this mutton pulao is my favorite?
It's your favorite.
[462.27] Your favorites change everyday.
What can I do?
[472.52] I was thinking to swing by
Uncle-Auntie's place on the way back.
[474.85] -Yeah.
- If they need some help, so...
[477.34] Are you guys going somewhere?
[478.75] Yeah, we were just going out.
[481.21] We thought we'd dine out too.
Don't wait.
[483.74] Yeah, good idea.
[485.37] She was anyway feeling a little down.
It'll be a nice change.  Her mood will lift.
[489.42] Go on, go.
[490.11] And I was thinking to go over
to Uncle-Auntie's on the way back.
[493.36] They're shifting so we'd help them.
[495.45] Yeah, yeah, why not?  In fact, if you
need anything.  A car, driver, servants.
[501.04] - So much stuff is needed to move.
-No, Mama.  Baba has arranged everything.
[505.28] And he's found a job at a
really reputable company as well.
[507.66] Really?
[509.54] That's great.  congratulations.
[512.57] - Go, go.  Have fun.
- Okay, Mom.  Bye!
[531.78] Seriously, Mom?  60,000 rupees?
[536.97] Is this a joke?
[539.23] Dear, it's not a joke, but it's reality.
[542.05] I also got a little worried,
but we have to be practical.
[547.28] Finding a job at your baba's age
is very difficult,
[550.58] and this is just temporary.
[553.13] Whenever he finds a better job,
he'll quit from here.
[555.92] Mama, whatever it is,
[557.69] it was very stupid of Baba to
reject the offer from Shahzar's parents.
[561.13] They were insisting so much
for him to work there.
[564.31] But Baba is crazy with pride.
[567.05] He has such an extensive experience,
what's the point of this ordinary job?
[571.62] I can't believe
you're saying such silly things.
[574.28] You're an MBA graduate.
[576.69] Don't you know multinationals
need young people now?
[580.36] Experience has nothing to do with it.
[584.28] I'm really disappointed.
[587.95] He didn't think about me at all.
[590.97] What am I going to say to my in-laws
about his job?
[594.73] We didn't raise you to be like this.
Are you so shallow?
[598.44] Bad times don't come by asking.
[603.05] It's our turn today,
it'll be someone else's tomorrow.
[605.64] This is reality, this is life.
[610.78] You know, Mama, there's no point.  Right?
[615.41] Because you are going to support Baba
in everything.
[618.87] Even the wrong things that Baba does,
they appear right to you.
[621.40] No matter how right everything I say is,
you always believe it's wrong.
[624.50] And on top of it all,
you've sold all the furniture.
[626.60] What will you take to the new house?
[647.56] How long will you listen,
how long should I speak?
[651.93] Mr.  Umar Hassan is working
at an advertising firm for Rs 60,000.
[662.79] Yes!  Do you want to hear some more?
[665.81] You'll be very happy to hear it.
[667.55] He is shifting into a rented home tomorrow.
[672.18] In a rented house!
[674.22] And the rent of that house is just Rs 30,000.
[678.90] Now you can imagine what
a 30,000 house would be like.
[682.06] And listen some more!  The brand new cars
that they had, they
[687.83] 're all out.
[690.34] Now it's a used car and Umar Hassan.
[696.64] I need all the details of the company.
[700.93] Okay.
[905.65] Don't worry.
[908.49] As soon as our financial situation
improves, we will move from here.
[914.65] You think I'm worried
because we've shifted to this house?
[919.84] You seem worried.
[923.22] I'm only thinking where
should I start from?
[927.75] I've to set up the whole house.  I've only
done one room so far and I'm tired.
[934.93] You don't worry, I'll help you.
We'll do it together.
[941.77] Let the first salary come,
we'll fix this house too.
[945.75] We'll get it painted or something.
[947.96] The plants are old too, we'll change that
and let's get grass planted in the front.
[952.51] And that fountain.  The
[956.74] fountain too.
[961.11] When are you starting your new job though?
[964.81] Tomorrow morning.
[967.38] Tomorrow will be the first day.
[969.03] Everything will be fine, God willing.
[992.68] Come, Mr.  Hassan.  Please take a seat.
I was waiting for you.
[996.12] Sir, before I join, I had a few idea in
my mind that I wanted to discuss.
[1003.00] I also wanted to discuss something
with you.
[1005.56] Yes?
[1007.62] We hired you in a hurry yesterday.
[1011.01] It's our company's policy to do a
background check on all our employees.
[1017.88] And we only make a decision
after we're completely satisfied.
[1021.15] Sir, I don't understand
what you are trying to say.
[1024.40] Let me clarify something
to you, Mr.  Hassan.
[1027.91] Our company isn't an ordinary company.
[1030.36] We don't hire people
just based on their degrees.
[1033.09] We see a lot of other things too.
[1035.79] Yes.
[1036.71] Mr.  Umar, you destroyed your business
because of your wrong decisions.
[1041.48] And that business wasn't even yours,
it was your wife's!
[1046.16] We need honest people for our company.
[1049.14] People don't like you.
[1052.14] Sir, I'll try my best to live up
to your expectations.
[1055.83] Give me a chance, I'll do my best.
[1058.74] People like you are deceivers
and you hurt your own people.
[1064.64] We can't hire you in our company, Mr.  Omar.
[1068.92] Sir, I...
[1071.03] I...
[1072.04] - Just give me one chance.  Please.
-You can go from here.
[1204.95] Stop it, dear.  You'll get tired.
[1207.70] You've been working since morning.
Go and rest.
[1211.30] Ammi...
[1213.07] Who gets tired of doing things
in their own home.
[1215.71] And besides, I'm not doing this alone.
You've helped me so much.
[1219.54] You still need rest.  Go and rest.
[1224.10] Ammi, you're making the gravy.
[1226.77] Let me at least make salad and rotis.
[1229.33] Okay, I'll let you do it today.
[1232.34] But I won't let you enter the kitchen
from tomorrow.
[1235.35] You've had servants working for you
your entire life.
[1238.20] You never even set foot in the kitchen.
[1241.26] And you have to make rotis today.
[1245.89] Look at where fate has brought you.
[1250.00] You didn't deserve a life like this.
[1258.35] Ammi Jaan...
[1260.89] God never tests people beyond
their tolerance.
[1265.97] And after God...
[1269.84] I have full faith in Umar.
[1272.38] You'll see!
[1273.46] Through his hard work and dedication,
he will regain his former status.
[1279.07] God is willing, God is willing.
[1288.33] I won't let you do anything after
you're done making rotis.  Go and rest.
[1293.45] The gravy is ready too.  -It
[1296.23] smells so nice!
- Does it smell nice?
[1300.33] What if Umar rejects my rotis?
[1302.32] No, no.  They're fine.  They're good.
[1304.97] This is how a person learns slowly.
[1307.59] I should add oil and make parathas.
[1319.93] What happened?  You came back early
from the office.
[1326.53] Mehru, please!  I don't answer
your questions.
[1332.05] Please, man.  Leave me.
[1337.62] I won't go anywhere until you tell me.
[1340.91] what do you want to hear?
[1344.18] That they fired me on my
first day of the job, claiming that
[1346.96] they didn't need an
unreliable, fraudulent person like me.
[1352.68] What?
[1361.71] Mehru, there is someone...
[1364.72] There is someone in this business sector...
[1368.07] Someone who is taking
out their hostility on me.
[1369.83] If I just found out once, I'll kill them.
[1374.62] But they...
[1376.26] who could it be?
We have no enmity with anyone either.
[1381.88] - I am doubtful of one person.
-Who?
[1384.97] Shehryar Anwar.
[1390.68] Shehryar?
[1395.45] Amma, Shahzar is not fated to be mine.
[1398.61] Stop talking about him.
[1400.98] Why would he leave his wife and marry me?
Have you ever thought about that.
[1405.32] They wasted my time then,
they're wasting my time now.
[1407.92] The first time I came here,
he went to the US to study.
[1409.88] The second time
I'm here, he's gotten married.
[1411.45] What's the point?
[1412.86] And she, Tabinda Khala,
she's a very cunning woman and a liar too.
[1416.93] She only cares
about what is beneficial to her.
[1418.64] She called me before
and she is doing the same again.
[1420.69] And she didn't call me for Shahzar!
She gets me to spy for her.
[1424.88] She just gives me thousands of
rupees for it then shows me attitude.
[1429.46] Shahzar isn't my destination, Amma.
[1434.25] My destination is Kamran.
[1437.25] And you know what?
[1440.37] I have fallen in love with him.
[1442.66] And he has also proposed to me.
[1445.12] We are getting married very soon.
[1447.81] We'll marry and move to Dubai,
and we'll call you there soon.
[1457.04] Why are you always so irritated
with Kamran?  I don't get it!
[1460.09] He's a great guy and he's very responsible.
[1462.31] He's not as irresponsible
as you think he is.
[1464.87] He's exactly the guy I wanted.
[1468.04] He obeys me and is ready
to do everything for me.
[1474.51] We've made a lot of plans.
[1486.29] Dear, don't lose hope.  Have faith in God.
[1490.85] If he closes one door,
he opens 70 new ones.
[1496.36] Ammi, I'm not hopeless, but what can I do?
[1499.71] Everything got ruined and destroyed.  You
[1504.28] must pass this test.
Just control yourself.
[1509.83] These harsh times will pass, God willing,
but how do I handle myself?
[1515.11] I tried a lot...
[1518.33] I tired a lot to save this business
somehow.
[1523.09] Don't ever lose hope.
[1525.12] Can your advice help me
regain my lost position?
[1529.77] Can I regain the honor I once had?
[1533.90] Don't talk like cowards, Omar.
[1536.51] Face the situation.
[1538.63] You can't just lose courage like this
and sit back.
[1541.11] I was trying to gather courage.
[1543.14] I was trying to fight like men too but the
whole world thinks I'm a thief, a fraud.
[1549.64] How do I make them believe that I haven't
recklessly ruined my wife's business!
[1553.75] Omar, you don't have to make anyone
believe you.
[1556.78] Mehr-un-Nisa has always trusted you,
she still does.
[1561.13] You shouldn't think about what anyone says
or thinks.
[1565.12] Just thank God that you've
gotten a loving wife like Mehru.
[1570.39] That's true but I have to think
about the world too.
[1574.65] I have to get a job with them,
whatever I do, I have to do it with them.
[1579.93] And someone is constantly telling them
that I am a fraudulent man.
[1585.43] I cheated my father in law.
[1593.42] Don't worry, everything is going to be fine.
[1607.79] Umar is doubting Shehryar.
[1610.31] He thinks he's the one bad-mouthing him
throughout the business circle.
[1614.83] Umar has lost his mind.
[1617.79] He's doubting a good man for no reason.
[1621.25] Shehryar might be a bit bitter,
but he's not a bad man.
[1625.41] And you shouldn't mind him either.
[1628.91] He'll stop being so
irritated once he finds a job.
[1634.60] But, Amma...
[1637.76] Umar never spoke to me this way before.
[1641.81] Don't worry, he'll be fine.
[1646.83] Amma...
[1649.68] I was thinking that...
[1654.45] God forbid if...
[1658.43] if Umar doesn't find a suitable job, so... I'll get a
[1662.33] job.
[1664.42] What?
[1668.83] Will you get a job?  No, no, no.
[1672.47] You can't work.
[1674.67] Umar wouldn't want that and neither do I that
you go out and work while you're sick.
[1684.22] No, I will get a job.
[1686.72] Even if you and Umar didn't like it.
[1691.46] We need it.
[1699.69] Umar's career has been destroyed.
[1702.07] He didn't just lose his job.
[1703.77] He was so disgraced
and slandered in the city
[1707.17] that nobody wants to hire him
or have any association with him.
[1713.32] I still remember when Rashda sent sweets
when Umar's proposal was fixed.
[1720.88] You cried so much.
[1724.14] -How much did you suffer?
- I remember.
[1728.33] I remember every single moment.
[1729.75] You were saying that they've shifted
to a slump or something?
[1735.05] So why don't you do this, take Shahnawaz
and go over to their home.
[1740.09] So Shahnawaz knows that he has married his
brilliant son into such an ordinary family.
[1748.04] His career is destroyed,
he doesn't have a job,
[1751.94] Now, he will live a life of
dependence for the rest of his life.
[1755.73] I'm just waiting for the moment
[1757.36] when he will come to me, crawling
and begging for help.
[1763.01] He'll be indebted to me
for the rest of his life
[1764.95] and his daughter's eyes
will forever be downcast with gratitude.
[1769.05] His pride will turn to dust.
[1771.35] And she won't ever dare to open her mouth
in front of me.
[1777.23] I am waiting for that time.
[1788.94] -Who is it?
-Mama, it's us.
[1791.26] - Please open the door.
- Okay!
[1801.17] - Salam, come in.
- Salam.
[1803.95] - Salam.
-Salam, son.
[1806.27] You two must have very long lives,
touch wood.
[1808.87] I was just thinking of calling you
and inviting you over.
[1812.23] -Dear, did you find the house easily?  -Yes
, yes.  It was not an issue.
[1815.46] -Come in.  -Yes
.  Rameen?  Come in.
[1832.30] Hello, Minal.  What's going on?
[1834.83] Nothing.  I was just going out for shopping.
[1837.21] Oh, I was just coming to ask you
to let's go shopping.
[1840.89] I asked your sister-in-law as well,
but she went somewhere with Shahzar.
[1846.50] We'll shop and then go to a nice place
to eat.  Sounds good?
[1852.01] It'll take a lot of time if we stop to eat.
[1855.42] And Mom wouldn't allow me to stay out
for so long.
[1859.49] Are you a child that you
require someone's permission?
[1863.40] And I'm with you to look out for you.
[1865.85] And what issue would khala have
if I'm with you.
[1871.84] Okay, don't be upset.
I'll ask mom for permission.
[1876.24] We'll watch a movie and go to a nice place
for dinner too!
[1879.66] All right.  You go on,
I'll come in 2 minutes.
[1882.12] Okay.
[1896.66] Pick up the phone!
[1899.22] Yes, hello.
[1900.58] I am leaving.  I'll send you the address
the moment I get there.  Come quickly.  Is
[1904.54] everything right?  Don't be late!  Okay.
[1915.98] Mom, why these formalities?
We'll leave now.
[1920.93] What formality?
[1922.49] I thought I'd make Shahzar's favorite
chicken biryani.
[1926.56] - We've had tea, right?  That's enough.
-How is that possible?
[1930.31] You've come to our home for the first time
and we should send you off without dinner?
[1934.73] Umar also wanted you guys
to have dinner with us.
[1938.30] He has only gone out for a little while,
he'll be back soon.
[1941.76] Mama, I don't want to meet him.
[1944.03] I've come to meet you.
[1946.01] We'll just leave now.  Let it be.
[1949.33] What's wrong with you, Rameen?
[1952.51] what are you saying?
[1955.03] And you...
[1956.62] why are you so mistrustful of your father?
[1959.79] Because I have a lot of reasons to be.
[1962.80] And you'll never understand that
because there's a veil over your eyes.
[1966.51] And you don't see anyone except him.
[1969.80] Please, Rameen.
[1973.78] Mama, you can silence me.
[1976.13] How are you going to silence the
people talking about us in the world?
[1980.24] The thing that the entire family is saying
about Baba's character,
[1983.66] do you have any idea about that?  But no!
[1986.48] You're not hearing anything.
You don't see anyone except him.
[1990.13] I know.  I know everything.
[1993.80] But I don't care about people.
[1996.04] Nor do I want to shut them up.  Do
[1998.72] you know what upsets me?
[2000.99] Your words!
[2002.43] And your behavior hurts me.
[2005.95] Who is it?  Who is this enemy of ours
that has filled your head with poison?
[2014.78] What kind of daughter are you?
You know your father is upset right now.
[2019.12] You should encourage him, talk positively,
and what are you doing?
[2023.97] You're coming here with this attitude?
[2026.56] When did you become so insensitive?
[2035.35] I don't know how you guys live here.
[2038.53] It's so weird here, such weird people.
[2042.11] I felt so embarrassed to come here
with Shahzar.
[2045.97] -What could he be thinking about us?
-What could he be thinking?  What?
[2050.42] That we've fallen to the floor
from the sky?  So what?
[2054.48] How long is he going to think like that?
He'll get sued for it.
[2057.66] Rameen, we have to live here.
This is our lifestyle now.
[2064.90] I won't let you live here.
[2067.00] Really?  Fine.  I'm ready.  where are
you going to take us?  To your in-laws?
[2073.95] Take some advice from your mother.
[2077.68] The sooner you accept this reality,
the better it is for you.
[2082.57] And thank God...
[2085.41] it's not such a big deal.
People go through very bad times.
[2090.48] They love in worse conditions than us.
[2094.24] You should be proud of your father.
[2097.19] He is such a graceful man
with such a strong character.
[2101.16] What are you doing/
[2104.06] And top it all off,
instead of helping your mother,
[2106.05] you're showing attitude and passing judgment
, and holding councils,
[2109.60] Go.  Please go and let me make biryani.
[2112.58] You must be getting sweaty in the kitchen.
[2132.69] The food was really nice though.
[2134.83] -The masala tikka was really nice.
-Very tasty.
[2139.35] And that juice?  Wow!
[2174.91] Who's this weird guy?
[2177.45] Idiot.  He parked his car right behind mine.
[2180.31] Let me just talk to him!
