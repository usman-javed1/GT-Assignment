[14.21] If you want to degrade Umar,
his daughter is in your home!
[18.94] They're newly married.
[21.39] Let her enjoy for a few days.
[24.54] Then she has to pay
for what her father did.
[27.55] What's going on?  Is something
going on with you and Shahzar?
[31.97] -No, everything's fine.
-No, there is something.
[35.19] He didn't have breakfast this morning,
his mood was really off too.
[38.28] You didn't come out of your bedroom
since last night.
[43.19] You can open up your heart to me.
[46.58] You can consider me your friend.
[48.29] I don't know what's wrong with Shahzar.
[50.74] All of a sudden, he has started thinking
that I don't care about him.
[53.76] That's why I don't respect him.
[55.41] He also has an issue with me referring
to him informally.
[58.51] What?
[61.31] Really?  But yours is a love marriage.
You were friends before you got married.
[68.29] I don't know, Mama.
[69.67] I think he wants me to become
a typical housewife.
[73.26] Make tea for him, serve him food,
iron his clothes for him.
[78.80] This is quite unusual, and moreover,
why would you go to such lengths?
[83.74] There are servants in the house, there's
a system in place, everything works.
[87.63] I am not making any complaints to you.
[90.03] But I'm very worried
about all of this.
[93.81] Today, he even told me that I
can't go out of the house by myself.
[97.35] Or if I go,
I must take permission from him.
[100.08] Very strange.
[102.36] He had never liked this.  Anyway,
don't worry.  I'll talk to him.
[108.51] Please don't say anything,
or he'll feel as if I've complained.
[112.50] Oh, no, no.  Don't worry.
I won't say your name.
[115.88] But let me talk to him.
[118.45] There's something that's bothering him.
[121.21] Let me find out.
[123.89] It's just ridiculous.
[128.85] I've told Mom we're going to stay out
all day and have fun.  Enjoy ourselves.
[134.52] I asked your bhabhi too,
but she said no.
[139.27] She has too much attitude, no?
[142.87] No, man.
[144.52] She's really nice.
We became really good friends too.
[147.91] But she has been really upset
ever since her dad's financial crisis.
[152.93] Anyway, what is it to us?  We're going to
shop, watch a move that has just come out.
[156.90] And we'll go and dine at a very,
very good restaurant.
[161.36] We're going to have so much fun today.
[166.72] Tell me, do you talk to Kamran?
[171.57] Kamran who?
[173.01] Oh, the one who is in love with you,
who else?  Is
[175.88] that cheaper?  Loser?
[178.20] The one who makes me lose my head
by constantly messaging me?
[181.24] So what?  Talk to him.
You should also meet him once or twice.
[184.58] Never!  I don't talk to such losers
and cheapsters.
[187.67] And if Mom is found out?  I'm dead.
[191.72] I don't get this childish behaviour.
You're always so focused on Mom.
[196.22] The girls in your class,
they all have boyfriends.
[200.10] They go out on dates.
[201.49] In fact, they choose their life partners
themselves too.
[204.17] You just keep talking mom all the time.
[206.78] And he was a flirt or a hoodlum.
[211.99] Didn't you see him that day?  He
looked so nice when he got out of the car.
[216.42] Life doesn't give you opportunities
like this again and again.
[218.71] And when such guys flirt with you,
you shouldn't say no.
[226.93] He looked very rich.
[230.71] He might be rich.  Why do I care?
[234.47] You're making a big mistake
by ignoring him.
[236.80] Life doesn't offer such
opportunities repeatedly.
[239.42] And who knows...
[243.17] maybe he's your Mr.  Right...
[246.32] whom you've always been searching for.
[258.80] Anyway, tell me which movie do you want
to watch?
[263.48] Any movie that you like.
[266.42] Okay, then let's go to the cinema first.
[286.89] Life doesn't offer such
opportunities repeatedly.
[289.29] And he wasn't a flirt or a hoodlum.
[292.79] Didn't you see how good he looked
when he got out of that car.
[306.27] When such guys flirt with you,
you shouldn't say no.
[310.10] Who knows...
[312.46] maybe he's your Mr.  Right...
[314.62] whom you've always been searching for.
[346.35] I heard that you offered Rameen's father... a
[349.75] job at our company.
[352.42] - I didn't, your son did.  -It
's the same thing.
[355.77] He thinks in your mind.
He doesn't even breathe about you.
[360.51] But I didn't have anything
to do with this decision.
[362.21] He didn't talk to me, it was
his independent decision.
[367.05] And besides, he has the right.
[369.37] And if he wants to help his in-laws,
what's wrong with that?
[373.26] I don't think we should object
to this decision of his.
[376.46] Fine, he's the owner of the company.
[378.73] But all of this?  I established it for him.
[382.97] He didn't earn anything with his efforts.
[386.08] He is giving us such prominent posts
in the company as charity.
[391.06] First you hired that girl in the company,
[394.27] then you got her into the house...
[396.43] and now?
[398.23] You want to make Shahzar's deceitful
father-in-law the marketing head?
[405.69] Dad, if Mom employs some poor relative
of hers
[411.27] or lets her live in our home,
what's so wrong with that?
[415.99] And as for my in-laws,
so please don't worry.
[421.67] The job I offered him, he rejected that.
[426.73] And he doesn't need anything
from you financially either.
[432.29] Just relax.
[486.12] yes, what is it?
[492.14] Hello.
[496.27] How are you?
[498.61] I'm fine.
[504.57] And you?
[508.10] After seeing you...
[510.36] I feel much better.
[515.49] By the way...
[517.29] I wasn't expecting you
to come meet me here.
[522.30] Thank you...
[524.07] for trusting me.
[526.72] For accepting my request.
[530.24] But what am I even saying?
Why are you standing?
[534.37] Please sit.
[537.70] Please.
[539.77] Sure.
[587.15] Honestly, I'm not as cheerful
as I appear to you.
[594.30] But talking to you,
I feel a sense of closeness.
[602.11] When I first saw you, I realized it then...
[605.98] that you're the girl... that I
[608.15] was waiting for.
[612.00] I'm so busy with my business that I
don't get the time to hang with friends.
[619.08] What about your family?
[622.51] Family...
[627.23] When I was five years old...
[629.57] my family passed away in a car accident.
[632.89] I'm so sorry.
[637.75] Any siblings?
[641.66] I am an only child.
[645.67] After my family's passing,
[646.82] I struggled greatly but managed
to hold myself together.
[650.60] Dad had a vast business.
[653.63] I'm trying to take care of that.
[656.97] Business?
[658.90] What is your business about
[661.64] We import cars from Japan,
we have a leather business.
[664.11] In fact, we have a leather factory.
[681.25] Although...
[683.39] I have almost travelled the entire world.
[686.51] I've met 1000 girls.
[690.03] And I'm friends with most of them too.
[694.12] But...
[696.13] the happiness that I get out
of your company...
[700.63] I don't get that with anyone else.
[703.48] There's definitely something special
about you.
[707.45] When I saw you for the first time...
[710.57] so I felt a little different.
You're very different than anyone else.
[717.39] Your eyes are very pretty.
[721.16] You know, I didn't even feel bad...
[725.90] when I sent you a bouquet...
[729.20] and you rejected it
instead of accepting it.
[749.00] - Salam.
-Where did you go?
[752.81] Me?  I went out for shopping
with my friends.
[755.90] Really?  Show me what you got?
Where is it?
[759.23] I didn't like anything so I didn't buy it.
[762.48] Right.  If you go out with your friends,
at least inform me.
[767.07] Or take your phuppo.  Nano's here too,
take her.
[770.39] Or at least take your driver and your car.
[773.27] Sometimes you act like a typical mother.
[776.13] I am not a little child.  I know what is good
and bad for me.
[779.26] So just relax.  I'll go and change.  Relax.
[803.35] I knew it!  I knew a handsome, rich prince
will come into your life
[808.94] and he'll take you away in his big car.
[814.70] I could never even fathom it.
[818.18] That I'll fall in love so suddenly.
[821.97] Someone will love me intensely.
[825.69] So what?  Are you really in love with him?
[831.67] Yes.
[834.96] Maybe this was the kind of guy
I was looking for.
[838.53] And you know?  He has no family.
[843.43] No mother, father, a sister or a brother.
[848.60] wow man.  What a fate you have!
[851.57] So it means now, along with his home,
you're going to rule his heart too.
[859.37] Tell me something.
[862.26] Won't Khala have any objections
that he's alone, he has no family?
[868.54] This is the guy Mom always wanted for me.
[870.99] Who has no family?
[872.76] I mean, there's no fuss about the in-laws.
[877.73] Right.
[879.23] So Khala wants a family for you
where there are no in-laws.
[884.61] Wow.
[886.51] Don't mind me saying.
[888.71] But for Khala, the best quality in a man
is his money.
[894.13] And if we look at it,
Kamran is very wealthy.
[899.13] He is not lacking in that department.
[906.38] - I am very happy for you.  -Thank
you.
[911.50] Anyway, forget about me.  You tell me.
[914.86] What do I say?  I am the same as ever.
[921.46] Good job, boss.  You are doing very well.
[926.19] So how did you like my acting?
[928.50] Oh, brilliant.
I think it was beyond amazing.
[933.00] Along with Minal, you won my heart too.
[936.45] Oh, I'm doing all of this
to win your heart.
[940.40] Once my boss is out of the country,
his showroom will be under my control.
[947.43] And then you'll see.  Things will go exactly
as we want them to.
[960.94] What are you saying, Amma?
[962.38] You know Minal has no shortage
of proposals.
[964.86] But her mind is always in the clouds.
If only she likes something.
[968.98] Yes, of course.  The guy needs to meet her
standards, and she has to like him as well!
[973.68] Tell me, how is your daughter-in-law?
[975.86] Her mood was really down
yesterday after Shahzar scolded her.
[979.90] But she was laughing a lot
at breakfast today, very happy.
[984.70] Stubborn.  Nothing affects her.
[987.91] But Shahzar was very upset
when I told him about your illness.
[991.34] He said he'd take care of Nano's treatment
himself, even if it means going abroad.
[995.22] He wrote a personal check
with a very hefty amount too.
[997.98] Oh my God.  What if we get caught in the lie?
[1002.17] We will be completely humiliated.
[1004.37] And your husband will taunt us too.
[1007.80] You don't worry, I'll handle everything.
[1009.75] I've arranged for the reports,
they'll be here soon.
[1012.99] But tell me, how long are you
planning to keep up this charade?
[1016.20] Amma, this is the safest drama.
[1018.33] You know Shahnawaz doesn't want you
in this house.  This is just an excuse.
[1024.30] Forget it.  Anyway, what did you do
about Umar's job?
[1030.29] He rejected our offer.
[1033.53] I'll have to think of something else.
I'll see what I can do.
[1058.97] Ammi!
[1061.00] Ammi!
[1062.52] Oh my God!
[1064.34] -I feel everything is lost.
-What happened, Mehru?
[1066.49] what's wrong?
[1067.19] I think we've lost all of our documents.
I don't remember where I kept them.
[1078.21] Here.  This file contains all the original
documents, including your degrees.
[1082.90] Everything's in there.
[1085.51] Oh thank God.
[1088.11] I was so worried.  I thought we lost
all these documents.
[1092.68] We didn't ever need them before.
[1096.11] Why do you need it though?
[1099.31] Just...
[1101.65] Because I've decided to get a job, Ammi.
[1105.52] A job?
[1107.89] Did you talk to Omar about this?
[1111.33] Not yet, but I'm sure he'll agree.
[1115.14] - But, Mehru, your health...
- What's wrong with my health?
[1119.09] The doctors didn't forbid
me from working, did they?
[1122.51] I've been so much better after the surgery.
[1132.05] What happened?
[1134.81] I never even thought...
[1137.34] that we would have to witness such days.
[1143.28] And, Mehru.
[1144.54] Umar won't give you permission for this,
and I don't want you to get a job either.
[1150.49] Why do you worry?
[1153.17] You know, it is crucial for both the
husband and wife to work in today's world.
[1158.28] Look at Tabinda.  She looks after
the entire business of her husband.
[1163.95] And whether you work for yourself
or someone else, it's the same thing.
[1168.48] And I won't opt ​​for any ordinary job, Ammi.
[1171.07] I have a foreign degree and job experience
of two years working with my father.
[1177.33] You don't worry.
[1191.87] You're my brave Ammi, right?
[1198.88] May God give you strength.
[1200.80] I promise you...
[1204.37] things might get as good as
they were before...
[1208.19] but God willing,
our situation will get better.
[1222.69] Just to be clear.
[1224.10] If you think you're gonna flirt with
me, pass time, so it's not going to work.
[1233.60] Minal, you are misunderstanding me.
[1236.57] A girl as elegant and decent as
you is not meant for just passing time.
[1244.24] In fact...
[1246.29] you hold a very high place in my heart.
[1250.89] You're very special for me.
[1256.19] I love you very much.
[1259.96] And I can do anything for you.
[1263.65] Anything.
[1268.41] You can do anything for me...
[1275.46] Can you die for me?
[1281.88] What happened?  You can't?
[1285.68] You were saying a lot of things
just now.
[1288.07] "You're special for me, you're elegant."
All you can do is talk.
[1293.44] You can't die, can you?
[1305.21] Let's go?
[1308.96] Let's go.
[1348.07] I will ask you again.
[1350.83] will you marry me?
[1356.79] All right.
[1359.05] You can remain steadfast
on your decision...
[1362.07] and see the results.
[1372.48] Okay then!
[1373.80] As long as you don't believe me,
I'll keep walking like this.
[1377.14] Tell me!  will you marry me?
[1380.92] I want to hear your answer!
[1383.55] Tell me!
[1384.91] Ka-- Kamran, are you crazy?
Just... just come back!
[1391.76] Please just come back!
[1441.14] You didn't even ask me...
[1444.53] and took such a big decision.
Started looking for a job already.
[1449.92] Because, Umar, I knew...
[1452.82] if I ask you for permission,
you're instantly going to say no.
[1457.43] Umar...
[1459.19] I know about what you're going through.
[1463.37] What good am I to you if I don't
support you during this time?
[1467.67] Mehru, you've always helped me.
[1470.75] You've always been my companion.
[1473.31] But the way...
[1475.95] the way your health is, I--
Everything will be disturbed.
[1481.74] Nothing will be disturbed.
[1484.41] I've made a plan.
[1487.62] There's a maid for cleaning,
I've employed her.
[1490.65] Ammi will take care of the house.
[1492.72] In the evening, after work, I'll
come and help her in the kitchen.
[1497.83] I can handle work and home.
[1500.32] I've said no and that's it.
You won't be working.
[1504.20] - Umar, but... -
I've said it.
[1506.53] There's no need for this.
I have enough savings.
[1510.07] Your treatment will continue and we'll be
able to run the house too.  Don't worry.
[1515.34] I don't want to work just for the money.
[1518.87] I want to work for myself.
[1521.53] So that my time is spent nicely.
[1525.95] I already have many accusations against me.
[1528.59] That I took over your father's property
and betrayed you.
[1532.27] I didn't run the business properly.
[1534.47] I can't tolerate the accusations
I'll get from you working.
[1540.76] I didn't hear what people had to say then
and I won't hear them now.
[1544.29] And you shouldn't either.
[1547.24] What's the point of worrying yourself?
[1550.19] I told you.  I've made my decision.
[1554.06] I'll get a job.
[1556.70] I have a few interviews scheduled
at a few places.
[1559.43] I've made lunch.  You and Ammi should eat.
[1563.28] - I'll be back by 3.
- Meh-- Mehru.
[1719.14] Are you Mehr-un-Nisa, the only
daughter of the late Mr.  Manzoor Ahmed?
[1724.70] Yes.
[1725.79] But how do you know my father?
[1729.42] Who doesn't know him?
[1731.67] He had a very big advertising agency
in Lahore.
[1734.88] And he was one of the famous
and successful businessmen of that time.
[1738.88] Yes.
[1739.93] I've heard great things about him.
[1742.43] I've also heard that you and your husband
took care of his business when he passed.
[1751.22] That's exactly how it is.
[1753.18] So why have you come here for a job?
[1757.86] We've suffered a lot of financial loss
due to economic recession.
[1763.32] So, my husband thought it would be best
to close the business and move to Karachi.
[1769.43] What?  You closed your business?
[1772.28] -Yes, we had to.
-Why and how?
[1794.38] And then she went to an IT company.
[1798.48] And she spent around 30-45 minutes there.
[1802.21] After that, she came out
and went to a garment factory.
[1806.32] I think she'll look for a job.
[1811.62] You must quickly find out
whether she got the job or not.
[1815.60] Mr.  Umar doesn't have a job,
he'll have his wife get one now.
[1818.36] All right.
[1820.04] I'll get all the information quickly.
You don't worry.  -But
[1822.28] what did I say--
- Yes, yes, yes!
[1824.41] That's it.  Thank you.
[1831.03] Sir, the work is quite extensive,
but I know I'm a quick learner.
[1837.02] I will manage everything quickly,
God is willing.  I will handle everything.
[1842.37] Sir, if you don't mind,
I just have one question.
[1847.73] You've offered me the job or merit or...
[1854.54] in personal capacity
because you knew my father?
[1858.04] No, dear, no.  It's not like that at all.
[1860.97] I didn't offer you this job
in personal capacity.
[1864.18] I have offered you this job based on
your qualification and your dedication.
[1868.37] And I have full faith
that you'll excel here.
[1880.37] Please send Mrs.  Mehr-un-Nisa's
appointment letter to my room.
[1884.25] She will be joining us as a
planning supervisor from tomorrow.
[1888.05] Thank you.
[1891.05] - Okay dear.  -Thank
you so much.
[1893.53] You're welcome.
[1938.27] I have gathered all the information.
[1941.31] The name of the owner
of that company is Nawaz.
[1943.87] And he has employed Mrs.  Umar as...
Yes!
[1947.61] He has appointed her as a supervisor.
[1951.58] All right.  And what is the salary structure?
[1954.49] Approximately Rs 70,000 a month with conveyance
and other facilities.
[1963.75] Madam, can I tell you something?
[1966.66] I know a lot of people in that factory.
[1969.62] If you say so, it'll only take a minute
to cancel her contract.
[1976.41] No, no.  Not yet.
Let her fulfill her wishes.
[1979.36] It's good for Mr.  Umar to sit at home
for a few days while his wife works.
[1982.78] But you've told Mr.  Baqar for a job--
[1987.00] Yes, but he still hasn't offered him a job,
He's waiting for a green signal from me.
[1997.51] For a while, let me also witness the
spectacle of Umar's helplessness.
[2000.67] Anything else I can do for you?
[2002.21] No, thank you very much.  You may go
and do your work.
[2007.72] Sir, all the Lahore brand-related work
will be finished this week.
[2011.30] I don't want any delays like the last time.
[2015.65] Our contract with this party is very old.
[2019.79] Any complaint can result in a big loss
for us.
[2023.64] Sir, don't you worry about that.
[2025.06] This time, I am getting everything done
under my supervision.
[2028.07] There's no need for that.
[2030.36] I've appointed a new supervisor
at the factory.
[2034.77] She'll look after this matter.
[2037.14] Sir, the woman who came for an interview?
[2040.22] She has no experience related to garments.
[2042.97] How is she going to manage all of this?
[2045.31] You focus on your work,
[2048.12] I know how she'll manage it.  -There is
[2055.99] a job for a clerk at the college.
-What are you saying, man?
[2061.00] After all this education, a great
degree, and so much experience,
[2067.04] I'll work as a clerk in the education
department?  Think about it yourself.
[2070.43] Umar, given the current conditions,
it is very difficult for you to find a job.
[2074.80] Your reputation has been brutally damaged
in the business sector.
[2078.11] You're gonna get the same response
no matter where you go.
[2081.28] I think your stars are in
a bad phase right now.
[2084.81] No, I think I can teach business classes
to students.  I will teach tuition.
[2088.98] But you know my daughter is married,
she has her in-laws.
[2092.20] She gets to hear all kinds of things.
[2095.01] I have to be careful about everything,
and then my wife.  She wants to get a job.
[2099.60] This is why I am telling you
to take the job.
[2101.43] Otherwise your wife will have to work
and you'll get to hear people's taunts.
[2108.39] I don't understand, man.
[2157.78] what are you doing here in the
middle of the night?  Come, sleep.
[2163.45] - I am not sleepy.  You go and sleep.
-What do you mean?
[2170.47] So you're still upset
because of my job?
[2173.51] This is the first time I asked you
for something and you didn't listen.
[2177.84] You really want to work, right?
Do whatever you want.  Go.
[2181.93] What is your objection regarding my job anyway?
[2187.36] When you've decided to work, then fine.
Humiliate me.
[2191.45] Humiliate me as much as you want.
I'm ready.
[2194.53] But I'm upset with you about it
and I won't talk to you either.  -Do
[2198.17] whatever you want.
- Umar...
[2219.90] Minal has barely met him, yet
she's already decided to marry him.
[2224.61] This is why I used to say keep an eye
on the girl.  Do
[2226.74] n't allow her to go out alone.
[2228.39] Sir, have you ever received any complaints
against me?
[2231.40] This is why I was thinking to hand over
everything to you before my trip to Japan.
[2236.71] But after hearing all the complaints
about you, I'm thinking...
[2239.85] If my own daughter doesn't trust her
father, what can I expect from the world?
[2243.88] From today, I won't call you "Baba," and
I will never step foot in this house again.
