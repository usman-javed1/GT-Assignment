If you want to degrade Umar,
his daughter is in your home! They're newly married. Let her enjoy for a few days. Then she has to pay
for what her father did. What's going on?  Is something
going on with you and Shahzar? -No, everything's fine.
-No, there is something. He didn't have breakfast this morning,
his mood was really off too. You didn't come out of your bedroom
since last night. You can open up your heart to me. You can consider me your friend. I don't know what's wrong with Shahzar. All of a sudden, he has started thinking
that I don't care about him. That's why I don't respect him. He also has an issue with me referring
to him informally. What? Really?  But yours is a love marriage.
You were friends before you got married. I don't know, Mama. I think he wants me to become
a typical housewife. Make tea for him, serve him food,
iron his clothes for him. This is quite unusual, and moreover,
why would you go to such lengths? There are servants in the house, there's
a system in place, everything works. I am not making any complaints to you. But I'm very worried
about all of this. Today, he even told me that I
can't go out of the house by myself. Or if I go,
I must take permission from him. Very strange. He had never liked this.  Anyway,
don't worry.  I'll talk to him. Please don't say anything,
or he'll feel as if I've complained. Oh, no, no.  Don't worry.
I won't say your name. But let me talk to him. There's something that's bothering him. Let me find out. It's just ridiculous. I've told Mom we're going to stay out
all day and have fun.  Enjoy ourselves. I asked your bhabhi too,
but she said no. She has too much attitude, no? No, man. She's really nice.
We became really good friends too. But she has been really upset
ever since her dad's financial crisis. Anyway, what is it to us?  We're going to
shop, watch a move that has just come out. And we'll go and dine at a very,
very good restaurant. We're going to have so much fun today. Tell me, do you talk to Kamran? Kamran who? Oh, the one who is in love with you,
who else?  Is that cheaper?  Loser? The one who makes me lose my head
by constantly messaging me? So what?  Talk to him.
You should also meet him once or twice. Never!  I don't talk to such losers
and cheapsters. And if Mom is found out?  I'm dead. I don't get this childish behaviour.
You're always so focused on Mom. The girls in your class,
they all have boyfriends. They go out on dates. In fact, they choose their life partners
themselves too. You just keep talking mom all the time. And he was a flirt or a hoodlum. Didn't you see him that day?  He
looked so nice when he got out of the car. Life doesn't give you opportunities
like this again and again. And when such guys flirt with you,
you shouldn't say no. He looked very rich. He might be rich.  Why do I care? You're making a big mistake
by ignoring him. Life doesn't offer such
opportunities repeatedly. And who knows... maybe he's your Mr.  Right... whom you've always been searching for. Anyway, tell me which movie do you want
to watch? Any movie that you like. Okay, then let's go to the cinema first. Life doesn't offer such
opportunities repeatedly. And he wasn't a flirt or a hoodlum. Didn't you see how good he looked
when he got out of that car. When such guys flirt with you,
you shouldn't say no. Who knows... maybe he's your Mr.  Right... whom you've always been searching for. I heard that you offered Rameen's father... a job at our company. - I didn't, your son did.  -It
's the same thing. He thinks in your mind.
He doesn't even breathe about you. But I didn't have anything
to do with this decision. He didn't talk to me, it was
his independent decision. And besides, he has the right. And if he wants to help his in-laws,
what's wrong with that? I don't think we should object
to this decision of his. Fine, he's the owner of the company. But all of this?  I established it for him. He didn't earn anything with his efforts. He is giving us such prominent posts
in the company as charity. First you hired that girl in the company, then you got her into the house... and now? You want to make Shahzar's deceitful
father-in-law the marketing head? Dad, if Mom employs some poor relative
of hers or lets her live in our home,
what's so wrong with that? And as for my in-laws,
so please don't worry. The job I offered him, he rejected that. And he doesn't need anything
from you financially either. Just relax. yes, what is it? Hello. How are you? I'm fine. And you? After seeing you... I feel much better. By the way... I wasn't expecting you
to come meet me here. Thank you... for trusting me. For accepting my request. But what am I even saying?
Why are you standing? Please sit. Please. Sure. Honestly, I'm not as cheerful
as I appear to you. But talking to you,
I feel a sense of closeness. When I first saw you, I realized it then... that you're the girl... that I was waiting for. I'm so busy with my business that I
don't get the time to hang with friends. What about your family? Family... When I was five years old... my family passed away in a car accident. I'm so sorry. Any siblings? I am an only child. After my family's passing, I struggled greatly but managed
to hold myself together. Dad had a vast business. I'm trying to take care of that. Business? What is your business about We import cars from Japan,
we have a leather business. In fact, we have a leather factory. Although... I have almost travelled the entire world. I've met 1000 girls. And I'm friends with most of them too. But... the happiness that I get out
of your company... I don't get that with anyone else. There's definitely something special
about you. When I saw you for the first time... so I felt a little different.
You're very different than anyone else. Your eyes are very pretty. You know, I didn't even feel bad... when I sent you a bouquet... and you rejected it
instead of accepting it. - Salam.
-Where did you go? Me?  I went out for shopping
with my friends. Really?  Show me what you got?
Where is it? I didn't like anything so I didn't buy it. Right.  If you go out with your friends,
at least inform me. Or take your phuppo.  Nano's here too,
take her. Or at least take your driver and your car. Sometimes you act like a typical mother. I am not a little child.  I know what is good
and bad for me. So just relax.  I'll go and change.  Relax. I knew it!  I knew a handsome, rich prince
will come into your life and he'll take you away in his big car. I could never even fathom it. That I'll fall in love so suddenly. Someone will love me intensely. So what?  Are you really in love with him? Yes. Maybe this was the kind of guy
I was looking for. And you know?  He has no family. No mother, father, a sister or a brother. wow man.  What a fate you have! So it means now, along with his home,
you're going to rule his heart too. Tell me something. Won't Khala have any objections
that he's alone, he has no family? This is the guy Mom always wanted for me. Who has no family? I mean, there's no fuss about the in-laws. Right. So Khala wants a family for you
where there are no in-laws. Wow. Don't mind me saying. But for Khala, the best quality in a man
is his money. And if we look at it,
Kamran is very wealthy. He is not lacking in that department. - I am very happy for you.  -Thank
you. Anyway, forget about me.  You tell me. What do I say?  I am the same as ever. Good job, boss.  You are doing very well. So how did you like my acting? Oh, brilliant.
I think it was beyond amazing. Along with Minal, you won my heart too. Oh, I'm doing all of this
to win your heart. Once my boss is out of the country,
his showroom will be under my control. And then you'll see.  Things will go exactly
as we want them to. What are you saying, Amma? You know Minal has no shortage
of proposals. But her mind is always in the clouds.
If only she likes something. Yes, of course.  The guy needs to meet her
standards, and she has to like him as well! Tell me, how is your daughter-in-law? Her mood was really down
yesterday after Shahzar scolded her. But she was laughing a lot
at breakfast today, very happy. Stubborn.  Nothing affects her. But Shahzar was very upset
when I told him about your illness. He said he'd take care of Nano's treatment
himself, even if it means going abroad. He wrote a personal check
with a very hefty amount too. Oh my God.  What if we get caught in the lie? We will be completely humiliated. And your husband will taunt us too. You don't worry, I'll handle everything. I've arranged for the reports,
they'll be here soon. But tell me, how long are you
planning to keep up this charade? Amma, this is the safest drama. You know Shahnawaz doesn't want you
in this house.  This is just an excuse. Forget it.  Anyway, what did you do
about Umar's job? He rejected our offer. I'll have to think of something else.
I'll see what I can do. Ammi! Ammi! Oh my God! -I feel everything is lost.
-What happened, Mehru? what's wrong? I think we've lost all of our documents.
I don't remember where I kept them. Here.  This file contains all the original
documents, including your degrees. Everything's in there. Oh thank God. I was so worried.  I thought we lost
all these documents. We didn't ever need them before. Why do you need it though? Just... Because I've decided to get a job, Ammi. A job? Did you talk to Omar about this? Not yet, but I'm sure he'll agree. - But, Mehru, your health...
- What's wrong with my health? The doctors didn't forbid
me from working, did they? I've been so much better after the surgery. What happened? I never even thought... that we would have to witness such days. And, Mehru. Umar won't give you permission for this,
and I don't want you to get a job either. Why do you worry? You know, it is crucial for both the
husband and wife to work in today's world. Look at Tabinda.  She looks after
the entire business of her husband. And whether you work for yourself
or someone else, it's the same thing. And I won't opt â€‹â€‹for any ordinary job, Ammi. I have a foreign degree and job experience
of two years working with my father. You don't worry. You're my brave Ammi, right? May God give you strength. I promise you... things might get as good as
they were before... but God willing,
our situation will get better. Just to be clear. If you think you're gonna flirt with
me, pass time, so it's not going to work. Minal, you are misunderstanding me. A girl as elegant and decent as
you is not meant for just passing time. In fact... you hold a very high place in my heart. You're very special for me. I love you very much. And I can do anything for you. Anything. You can do anything for me... Can you die for me? What happened?  You can't? You were saying a lot of things
just now. "You're special for me, you're elegant."
All you can do is talk. You can't die, can you? Let's go? Let's go. I will ask you again. will you marry me? All right. You can remain steadfast
on your decision... and see the results. Okay then! As long as you don't believe me,
I'll keep walking like this. Tell me!  will you marry me? I want to hear your answer! Tell me! Ka-- Kamran, are you crazy?
Just... just come back! Please just come back! You didn't even ask me... and took such a big decision.
Started looking for a job already. Because, Umar, I knew... if I ask you for permission,
you're instantly going to say no. Umar... I know about what you're going through. What good am I to you if I don't
support you during this time? Mehru, you've always helped me. You've always been my companion. But the way... the way your health is, I--
Everything will be disturbed. Nothing will be disturbed. I've made a plan. There's a maid for cleaning,
I've employed her. Ammi will take care of the house. In the evening, after work, I'll
come and help her in the kitchen. I can handle work and home. I've said no and that's it.
You won't be working. - Umar, but... -
I've said it. There's no need for this.
I have enough savings. Your treatment will continue and we'll be
able to run the house too.  Don't worry. I don't want to work just for the money. I want to work for myself. So that my time is spent nicely. I already have many accusations against me. That I took over your father's property
and betrayed you. I didn't run the business properly. I can't tolerate the accusations
I'll get from you working. I didn't hear what people had to say then
and I won't hear them now. And you shouldn't either. What's the point of worrying yourself? I told you.  I've made my decision. I'll get a job. I have a few interviews scheduled
at a few places. I've made lunch.  You and Ammi should eat. - I'll be back by 3.
- Meh-- Mehru. Are you Mehr-un-Nisa, the only
daughter of the late Mr.  Manzoor Ahmed? Yes. But how do you know my father? Who doesn't know him? He had a very big advertising agency
in Lahore. And he was one of the famous
and successful businessmen of that time. Yes. I've heard great things about him. I've also heard that you and your husband
took care of his business when he passed. That's exactly how it is. So why have you come here for a job? We've suffered a lot of financial loss
due to economic recession. So, my husband thought it would be best
to close the business and move to Karachi. What?  You closed your business? -Yes, we had to.
-Why and how? And then she went to an IT company. And she spent around 30-45 minutes there. After that, she came out
and went to a garment factory. I think she'll look for a job. You must quickly find out
whether she got the job or not. Mr.  Umar doesn't have a job,
he'll have his wife get one now. All right. I'll get all the information quickly.
You don't worry.  -But what did I say--
- Yes, yes, yes! That's it.  Thank you. Sir, the work is quite extensive,
but I know I'm a quick learner. I will manage everything quickly,
God is willing.  I will handle everything. Sir, if you don't mind,
I just have one question. You've offered me the job or merit or... in personal capacity
because you knew my father? No, dear, no.  It's not like that at all. I didn't offer you this job
in personal capacity. I have offered you this job based on
your qualification and your dedication. And I have full faith
that you'll excel here. Please send Mrs.  Mehr-un-Nisa's
appointment letter to my room. She will be joining us as a
planning supervisor from tomorrow. Thank you. - Okay dear.  -Thank
you so much. You're welcome. I have gathered all the information. The name of the owner
of that company is Nawaz. And he has employed Mrs.  Umar as...
Yes! He has appointed her as a supervisor. All right.  And what is the salary structure? Approximately Rs 70,000 a month with conveyance
and other facilities. Madam, can I tell you something? I know a lot of people in that factory. If you say so, it'll only take a minute
to cancel her contract. No, no.  Not yet.
Let her fulfill her wishes. It's good for Mr.  Umar to sit at home
for a few days while his wife works. But you've told Mr.  Baqar for a job-- Yes, but he still hasn't offered him a job,
He's waiting for a green signal from me. For a while, let me also witness the
spectacle of Umar's helplessness. Anything else I can do for you? No, thank you very much.  You may go
and do your work. Sir, all the Lahore brand-related work
will be finished this week. I don't want any delays like the last time. Our contract with this party is very old. Any complaint can result in a big loss
for us. Sir, don't you worry about that. This time, I am getting everything done
under my supervision. There's no need for that. I've appointed a new supervisor
at the factory. She'll look after this matter. Sir, the woman who came for an interview? She has no experience related to garments. How is she going to manage all of this? You focus on your work, I know how she'll manage it.  -There is a job for a clerk at the college.
-What are you saying, man? After all this education, a great
degree, and so much experience, I'll work as a clerk in the education
department?  Think about it yourself. Umar, given the current conditions,
it is very difficult for you to find a job. Your reputation has been brutally damaged
in the business sector. You're gonna get the same response
no matter where you go. I think your stars are in
a bad phase right now. No, I think I can teach business classes
to students.  I will teach tuition. But you know my daughter is married,
she has her in-laws. She gets to hear all kinds of things. I have to be careful about everything,
and then my wife.  She wants to get a job. This is why I am telling you
to take the job. Otherwise your wife will have to work
and you'll get to hear people's taunts. I don't understand, man. what are you doing here in the
middle of the night?  Come, sleep. - I am not sleepy.  You go and sleep.
-What do you mean? So you're still upset
because of my job? This is the first time I asked you
for something and you didn't listen. You really want to work, right?
Do whatever you want.  Go. What is your objection regarding my job anyway? When you've decided to work, then fine.
Humiliate me. Humiliate me as much as you want.
I'm ready. But I'm upset with you about it
and I won't talk to you either.  -Do whatever you want.
- Umar... Minal has barely met him, yet
she's already decided to marry him. This is why I used to say keep an eye
on the girl.  Do n't allow her to go out alone. Sir, have you ever received any complaints
against me? This is why I was thinking to hand over
everything to you before my trip to Japan. But after hearing all the complaints
about you, I'm thinking... If my own daughter doesn't trust her
father, what can I expect from the world? From today, I won't call you "Baba," and
I will never step foot in this house again.
