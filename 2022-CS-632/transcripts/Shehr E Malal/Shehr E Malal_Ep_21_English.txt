Tabinda wants to take revenge
on me for every bit of life... she’s imagined getting back at me for. She has reached a point where she
can't hear anything nor understand. - Is Mehr-un-Nisa okay?
-Phuppo, the doctors have given up. If I had known earlier that I got this job through Tabinda's
reference, I would never have accepted it. Don't you remember what Abbu used to say? If a woman loves,
she destroys herself for that love. And if she hates,
she destroys the other person. Tabinda wants to take revenge
on me for every bit of life... she’s imagined getting back at me for. She has reached a point where she
can't hear anything nor understand. I don't see Shahzar or Rameen around. Rameen is so upset because of her mother
that she doesn't come out of her room. So how is her mother doing now? It's critical.  Doctors aren't hopeful. So if Rameen wants to go,
send her there for a few days. Yeah, yeah.  She can go whenever she wants,
for however long she wants. I've told them we'll support them
as much as we can through their daughter. Shahzar said he'll bear all the
treatment expenses, whatever they need. Tabinda, that's great. They are our relatives.  It's our duty
to help them. But I've noticed one thing. Ever since Rameen has gotten married,
their circumstances have only gotten worse. But thankfully, Umar has found a job now. Yes, yes.  He got it through my reference. Through your reference? You never mentioned it before. what was there to say?  I tried to help him. You know I can't see Shahzar upset. Since Rameen and Shahzar's marriage, Shahzar hasn't had a single day
of happiness. Rameen has been so tangled with issues
at her home. Then I tried to make a plan for vacations, I forced Shahzar to go abroad
for a few days, in fact. That was also cancelled. God forgive me... but I think troubles have
cursed their house. You're right, you. I hope you remember.  We have to
meet today.  12 pm at the same place. I will wait for you. Tea. No tea, I have to leave quickly. Is there something important? Yes, I have to go for an interview. And make sure you're ready by 3,
I've to take you to the hospital.  ok? I'll go now.  Okay, bye. Here, a cheque for 10 lakhs.  It'll help
you with Mehr-un-Nisa's treatment. I will take care of all the expenses. Keep your charity to yourself.
I don't need it. Oh!  Listen to me.
At least say what you came here to say. I didn't come here to talk to you. I came here to warn you, Tabinda. Stay away from my and my daughter's life. The hatred you're putting in her
heart for me, it'll be very costly for you. And if I wanted to... what would you do?  Tell me.
what will you do? Are you going to blackmail me? I'm not blackmailing you,
you're blackmailing me. Ever since my daughter
got married into your family, I haven't had a single night
of peaceful sleep. do you even care? what is this revenge for? Just for breaking off the engagement
with you and marrying Mehr-un-Nisa?  Is it a small thing for you? Breaking of an engagement, severing
a relationship, that's a small thing? It took me years to forget about you. It's not easy to tolerate betrayal,
Mr.  Omar. I didn't expect this selfishness from you. You used to love me a lot, right? But you shattered all my illusions
by choosing wealth over me. It took away my trust in people.
You broke off your relationship with me. I didn't marry Mehr-un-Nisa for money.
I've told you this before. I've tried it a lot of times! You broke off your engagement
to a poor man's daughter and married a wealthy, sick woman so that you can take over her wealth
after her death. Enough, Tabinda!  I don't want to hear
any more of this. You were very unfair to me.
You betrayed me. And I will never forgive you for that. For God's sake!  Don't punish my daughter
for the mistakes I didn't make. She is very innocent.
What has she got to do with any of this? I am requesting you.  Please, I'm sorry.
I am begging you. Remember a long time back, I begged you
liked this too? Begged and whined. But you and your mother did not pity me.
do you remember? I'm sorry, I'm extremely sorry. I am your sinner.  I made a mistake
that I left you and married Mehr-un-Nisa. But I was helpless.
What else was I supposed to do? Is that what you want to hear? It didn't even take you a second
to forget me and start a new life. But it took me ages. Maybe that's the difference between a man
and a woman. All my happiness was related to you. You left and took my happiness with you. But I thought you were very happy
after marrying Shahnawaz. Because I couldn't give you everything,
he gave it to you. Where were you? He took you from the ground
and put you on the sky. what do you think?  That I am very happy? I'm just alive. Only I know how I spent these years
being married to Shahnawaz. After marrying him, I got everything
except love. Because the word "love" was banished
from my dictionary the day you walked out. I tried a lot to make Shahnawaz happy. But my sacrifices,
my loyalty were never appreciated. I only received rejection
for being middle class. Middle class. You rushed into this marriage. Just to make me feel inferior. You married a rich man, right? Look, Tabinda, all we get from life
is what’s written in our destiny. No matter how hard we try,
no matter how hard we swim, but we can't change the tides. Tabinda, I can't change whatever happened. But I can only hope... that you'll forget the painful memories
of the past, and try to make a good life
with your family. It's very important for you. As for me,
I only have one request of you. Whatever you think I did wrong
to you in your opinion... just don't punish my daughter for it. I only had this request of you. And I hope you'll think about it. I'm not blackmailing you,
you're blackmailing me.  Ever since my daughter
got married into your family,  I haven't had a single night
of peaceful sleep.  What is this revenge for?  Just for breaking off the engagement
with you and marrying Mehr-un-Nisa?  It's a small thing for you?  Breaking of an engagement, severing
a relationship, that's a small thing?  It took me years to forget about you. You used to love me a lot, right? But you shattered all my illusions
by choosing wealth over me. It took away my trust in people. You broke off your engagement
to a poor man's daughter and married a wealthy, sick woman so that you can take over her wealth
after  her death. You were very unfair to me.
You betrayed me. And I will never forgive you for that. Mehru, where did you go?
Umar wasn't with you? Right now, your son is mourning his love
with his former fiancée. -What?
- I saw it with my own eyes.  Mehru ?  Mehr un Nisa, listen to me. Mehru, listen to me.  Mehru. Mehr-un-Nisa! Listen to me, dear! Mehru.  Mehru ! Mama's pain is increasing day
by day, Shahzar. The chemotherapy cannot happen;
the doctor has refused. Don't stress. I consulted with the doctor, and he suggested that if we take her
abroad, her treatment could be done. I wish it was like that.
I wish she'd let us do that. You know, Mama's absolutely right. When she says
that you are the ideal husband. You're a really good person. Really? And is Auntie the only
one who thinks like that or... you think the same about me too? My opinion doesn't really matter
in all of this. I love you. And that's all that matters. Can I ask you something? Do you still love me as much
as you did before our marriage? Shahzar, why do you
even have to ask me that? There was a need to ask so I did. Because I feel like you don't love me
as much anymore. I feel as if... that love has slipped away with time. Tell me, what can I do
to remove this doubt from your mind? Even if you don't do anything else... you can at least stop going to your home
as much as you do. Start spending time with me. You know you're very different
than other men, right? The others used to be so happy to send
their wives away... but you... you just become sad. That's because the men who send
their wives away don't love them. And I don't want to be one of those men. Thank God, you're smiling. I've been longing to see you happy. Keep smiling, man. You know, when you smile, it feels like... my life, my whole day is complete. Mama, what happened?  Please talk to me.
Why aren't you saying anything? Rameen, I spoke to the doctors. He says there's nothing to worry about. Maybe Auntie is very stressed. And that's why she fainted,
but she's much better now. What are you so stressed about that
your fainted?  Huh? Rameen... this is not the time.  Right now, Auntie isn't in a condition to be under
any mental pressure. Shahzar is right, dear. You should go. I want to be alone for a little while. Mama, I can't leave you like this. Rameen, listen to me. Please. Omar, it would be better if you leave too. I don't want to listen to anything
you have to say. I know... the mistake that I made... I am not worthy to be forgiven for that. You can punish me however you want. If you want... you can hand me over to the police. I'll pay you back for every penny. I... I came to give Minal... pain. But when I came... I realized... that I love her. A person like you... A greedy, cheater like you
can never love someone. Why won't you trust me? You could go as far as
killing me to prove this. I have no interest in killing you. Sign this. And if I don't sign this, then? I actually love Minal. Why won't you believe me? I think she has learned everything
about you and your past with Tabinda. This is how she is going to react
for a few days. Yes, I... Yes, I admit, this is big news for her. Finding out the one thing I've
tried to hide from her all my life. I know this isn't easy for her, but... but she can give me one chance. Let me at least try and explain it to her. But there's one thing I don't understand,
Ammi.  How did she find out?  She... how did she get there? Maybe she heard you on the phone,
talking to Tabinda. I'm sick of Tabinda's name. Tabinda!  Tabinda!  Tabinda! I hate this name. She has made my and daughter's life hell,
but if she... if something happened to Mehru, Ammi,
I'll never forgive her. Never ever. Why are you so quiet? Aren't you going to say anything? Is there anything left to say and hear? You won't even give me a chance to explain? Aren't you going to ask
why I went to meet her? I... I know everything. I've found out everything. If you know everything then say something. Are you upset?  Complain. What kind of complaint is this? What anger, Omar? Come on, Mehru!  If you... if you keep behaving like this,
I will die suffocating. You are in no condition to
handle this alone.  I'm here! Just ask.  I will tell you everything
about my past. It's too late. Now I know everything about you. You were engaged to Tabinda. You loved each other a lot. You both swear to live and die together. And then I came along. No, you didn't come in the middle of us. Mehru, you were my destiny, my fate, and I was yours.
We had to meet. Had you not been there, it would've
been someone, but not Tabinda. Because the kind of woman she is,
she could never have been my partner. I buried all this... but somehow, through Shahzar,
she entered our lives again. Is that why you were so opposed
to their relationship? Yes. Such a big thing with me... Why did you share it with me? You don't deem me worthy? No, Mehru.  It was because of your health. I kept it hidden for so long, maybe I would have hidden it my whole
life, just so that you wouldn't be hurt. You made a big mistake
by keeping this secret from me. You should have told me. I would never have let my
daughter marry Tabinda’s step-son. This is why she likes this. Why... why is she being so cruel
to my daughter? She won't do anything. I won't let it happen until I'm alive. That woman is burning
with the fire of revenge. She's punishing my daughter
for your betrayal. What can we do? Promise me something. You have to protect my daughter after me. Nothing is going to happen to you. If possible, get her a divorce. After I'm gone, take her far away. Tabinda is a very dangerous woman. She lives with my daughter. She can do anything. You sit here.  I'll get water for you. What can I do? My child! I'm not worthy being forgiven
for the mistakes I've made.  You can punish me however you want.  If you want...  you can hand me over the to the police.  I came to cause Minal pain.  But when I came...  I realized... that I love her.  I truly love Minal.  Why won't you trust me? How come you're here today? I wanted to talk to you
about something important. How are you feeling now? - Coffee?  Tea?
-No. There's no need for any formalities. I didn't come here as a guest
or as your in-law. I just came here to ask you for something. Me? what can I give you?
what have you come to ask me? My daughter's happiness. The game of hide and seek that you've been
playing with her for the last 2 years... please stop, Tabinda. What's the point of all this? What did I do to your daughter? what didn't you do? For the past two years,
since my daughter's marriage, I haven't seen a day where she was happy. You've tried to cause her trouble
at every step. You've tried to get Shahzar to hate her. But I am telling you now, none of your tricks will work. Because your son truly loves my daughter. What's my daughter's fault? Just that she is Umar Hassan's daughter? The same Umar Hassan... who couldn't marry you. First of all, you don't have any proof
of these things, and secondly, don't bring Umar into this. You have nothing to do
with my personal life. Your personal life has been ruining
my daughter's life. It's just me who's found out for now. But soon your son
and husband will also know. What justifications will you give them? That you're ruining his daughter's life
to take revenge on your former fiancé? Are you seeking revenge
on Umar Hassan's daughter for his betrayal? It's not, it's hatred, Tabinda. In fact, what you have for Umar in
your heart is even greater than hatred. You never had true love for Umar. Maybe that's why you aren't together today. Women who are consumed with revenge
can never truly love someone. You need a very big heart for love. Which you don't have. All right, Tabinda. I thought I'd be able to come here
and get through to you. Get you to stop the hatred
and accept my daughter with an open heart. But now I understand it is impossible. I leave my daughter in the care of God. Just remember this, Tabinda. The game of hatred that you've started... it will only harm you. No, Amma!  You shouldn't have let her go
like this! God knows where she's gone too.
Her condition isn't good either. Son, I really tried to stop her.
But she didn't listen to me at all. God knows where she has gone off too.
Please call Rameen. Maybe she has gone to her home. Why would I call her?
She doesn't answer my calls. Where were you, Mehru? You don't know how worried we got
for you! Mehru, listen to me. You'll have to talk to me-- Dear, I'm very worried
about Mehr-un-Nisa. She hasn't eaten anything since yesterday. She's not taking her medicine
on time either. I'm trying to talk to her. Call Rameen.  Maybe she'll listen to her. She has stopped talking to you. What can I say? When I enter her room, either she's already asleep,
or she turns her face away from me. What can I say to her? She doesn't want to understand anything,
doesn't want to talk to me. Why don't you openly talk to her about it? Ammi, I want to openly talk to her.
I want to tell her everything. I want her to know the circumstances
under which I got engaged to Tabinda, why it broke, and how I ended up marrying
her.  But she... But she thinks I only married her for
her status, for her money and business. How do I clear this misunderstanding
when she doesn't even talk to me? -If you say, should I talk to her?
-No, Ammi.  I-- I'll try myself.  I'll wait for
the right time and talk to her. Son, if she thinks you
married her for her status, you need to clear this misunderstanding. You broke up with Tabinda for me, and you married Mehr-un-Nisa for me. This has to be cleared. Mehr-un-Nisa's father was so impressed
by your honesty, dignity, and hard work that he came to himself to talk
about his daughter's proposal. He was a heart patient. He knew he didn't have a lot of time. He couldn't have found a more suitable
person that you for his sick daughter. But you?  You weren't ready
for this marriage at all. They even offered you
shares in their company, but you rejected all their offers. Because you didn't want to break up
with Tabinda no matter what. You didn't want to break her heart. But then I convinced you. I begged you. I pressured you into marrying Mehr-un-Nisa. Thank God, it was the
right decision for both of you. Because you two were made for each other. You didn't deserve a greedy, selfish woman
like Tabinda.
