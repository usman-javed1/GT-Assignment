Baba! I think I should call and
inquire about his health. Then I have to invite them for the walima
as well. That won't be needed.
I've canceled the walima function. Forgive me! I can't do all of this.
Specially not anymore. What's the drama? Huh? - Why can't you do this? Why?
- What can't I do it? What can't I do it? Wow, very good! Let me remind you if you've forgotten. Not much has happened,
Shahzar has just gotten married. He turned the woman he loved
into his wife and brought her home! And in this entire situation,
you expect me to go after him. No, I can't do all of this. The person who couldn't be
mine before, how will he be now? Had I known you were calling me for this,
I swear to God I wouldn't have come. I left everything and came here.
I had such a good job! Which job? That third-class receptionist job? You're forgetting I gave you 2 lakh rupees
when you came here. 2 lakh rupees? Stop talking right now,
I'm telling you. Have you forgotten the spy work
you had me do for those 2 lakh rupees, - or should I remind you?
- Enough! There's no need to blackmail us.
Understand? Has my foot become my tutor now?
Stay in your limits! - Ungrateful!
- Really? What have I-- Enough! There's no need
for pointless arguments. I didn't call you here to impress Shahzar. Because you couldn't do it before,
and you're incapable of doing it at all. All you need to do is sow discord
between Rameen and Shahzar. - It's not an easy thing to do.
- It's not impossible either. Just do as I say.
I'll change your life in a few months. What such thing are you going to do
for me? I'll let you know. First just listen to what you have to do. You're not going to worry
about anything now. We'll fix everything. How are things going to get fixed
on their own? Those two projects... the ones I was relying on... the one I hoped would make
everything fall into place... we lost them too. Why is all of this happening? So what if we lost the projects?
We'll get more. You just can't lose hope. How can I not lose hope? All of this is happening to us and we... we don't even know why. Umar... listen to me carefully. Our business isn't more important
than your health. You always say this to me, right? There's no need to go to the office
until you've recovered. I already called your manager and told him You won't go to the office
until you're recovered, and he won't bring up any
issues with you. All right? What is he going to discuss with me anyway? He knows everything. And I also know what's about to happen. What's about to happen, Umar? For Rameen's wedding, I borrowed 50 lakhs
from a friend. And I thought that... I'll save the Lahore flat and... once the bank approves my loan,
I'll pay him back. But the bank has declined
to lend us any more money. Employees haven't been their salaries
for the last two month. They will all resign if they're
not paid within another week. I guess I'll have to sell
the Lahore flat now. But if the bank... pressures us to repay the loan... then maybe this house... the one you've already written
in Rameen's name, this also... will have to be pledged. No, Umar. We can't do this. We'll have to find another way. If this house is sold... we will be on the streets.
Where will we live? Either in a rented house, or... Rented house? Mehru, I'm tired, man. I can't do it. I tired a lot. I tried as much
as I could've. To save this business of yours.
I worked day and night tirelessly... but I'm sorry. I couldn't save it. Umar, you can't lose courage. Umar, I... I ruined everything. There's nothing left. Do you trust me? We will fix this. We'll fix everything. All right. You told me and I listened. But tell me, what will you
offer me in return for all of this? I was waiting for you to ask that. Thereâ€™s a great job opening at the office.
You'll work there. You'll get a good commission for
all the personal tasks you do for me. But I'll have to move here for that. Yeah, that's good. Pack up your things
and move here. I've also brought all of my things here. If you come as well, it'll
feel more like my home. Amma, what are you saying? You
said you'll go back to Hyderabad next week. To tell you the truth,
I don't like that city anymore. Since your brother and sister-in-law
left for Dubai, I feel uneasy there now. You know Shahnawaz doesn't like
you staying here. - Then why are you doing this?
- What is his issue? Okay, talk softly.
Talk softly, someone's going to hear. They can listen in all they want.
I'm not scared of him. My daughter handles his home,
his business, everything! That grumpy old man, a widower. I have entrusted him with my young,
beautiful daughter. He wasn't worthy of a beautiful wife
like you. He's also 25 years older than you! And he's not very handsome either. On top of that, he broke both his legs
in an accident and is now bedridden. A cripple! I have entrusted him
with a piece of my heart! He didn't value you at all. He should've worshipped the ground
you walk on. He hasn't given a single penny or a
single dime of his property in your name. - Enough! Stop it.
- Let it be! This is whole drama! That's right. You're absolutely right. You're still upset? Yes. Please forgive me, man. It's not about forgiveness. It's about yesterday's night. That already passed. You have no idea about the plans I had. I'll come to the room... I'll see you in your bridal dress... I'll tell you what's in my heart. Last night was the first night
of our new life. And you... Anyways... This... I got this for your mu-dekhai.
(the first look ceremony) I had planned to put it on
you with my own hands, but... Anyway, take it. - Put it on yourself, Shahzar.
- Put it on myself? Are you serious? That time has passed,
that opportunity is gone. You just wear it yourself. - Okay. Are you sure?
- Absolutely! Positive? - Yes.
- Okay. I took this bracelet... it goes on my wrist, - and we--
- Okay, one minute. What's wrong with you? You know what's the worst thing
and the best thing about you? You know me better than anyone else
in the entire world. You too. You know, you're a little cute as well. It's beautiful though. Thank you. You're welcome. There's a meeting at 10 o'clock
with Mr. Salman. Take the meeting points from my secretary. And I won't be able to join,
I have to go somewhere else. I'll come later. Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
I'll manage. And yes, I forgot to tell you something. You'll have to stay till late
at the office. I know you're newly married, but
the project is new, as you know. Your presence is very important. Come on, at least ask Rameen. What if she minds that her husband is
going to work the day after the wedding? - No, I understand.
- Yes, she understands. Rameen has own family business. She knows really well what needs
to be done to run a business. By the way, Rameen,
you don't have to worry at all. I'm also joining his office
in the next 2-3 days. Then Khala and I will handle everything.
And then he'll be free. - You're joining the office?
- What? Really? That's a surprise for me. - When are you joining? Who told you?
- I did. There's a vacancy in the sales department. I thought let me give her a chance and see
if she's worth it or not. It's a great idea! We'll have fun
at the office now. But I'm getting late, so I gotta go.
So I'll see you at the office. - Bye! Bye, bye.
- I'm coming. - Goodbye!
- Goodbye! You should see off your husband
when he leaves. Didn't your mother teach you any manners? Be careful from now on. Make tea for me. I didn't tell you, I told Rameen. This is so pretty. Did Bhai give you this? Very nice. Did he give it to you for your mu-dikahi? God, Khala! Look at this, it's so pretty. Ask Shahzar where he got it from.
I want one exactly like this. You can keep it if you like it.
I'll get Rameen a new one. No, no, Khala. I don't it so much
that I'll take her mu dikhai's gift. I'm sure she won't mind. Beside, you're Shahzar's cousin. You're her sister-in-law according
that relationship, this is your right. Rameen, give this bracelet to her,
I'll get you a new one. Okay? It's very nice. Khala, look. I'll have to say it. Shahzar's choice
is amazing! Shahzar's choice really is amazing. He usually doesn't like ordinary things. He was a bit hasty in regards
to his marriage. Otherwise he had multiple very good girls
to choose from. She has a lot of attitude. Yeah, I see it too. But, Khala, it has so many diamonds.
It must be really expensive. It's a very beautiful bracelet. - What is this, Mom? What did you do?
- What did I do? The bracelet Bhai gave as a gift to Rameen,
you gave it to Maria? She gave it herself. Didn't you see how off Rameen's mood got? You're really worried about your bhabi? Yes, I care. Maria, go
and give this bracelet to Rameen. What is your problem? When did you
get so crazy about pitying someone? It's not about pity, Mom. I don't
understand why you're being so rude. Bhai will react very badly if he found
out you gave the bracelet to Maria. It is none of your business! It is my business! What's wrong with you? You love Bhai a lot but with Bhabi,
you act like a typical mother-in-law! You're arguing with me because of her? - Mom, all I'm saying to you--
- Stop it! Don't try to interfere in my matters,
understand? Such drama. She's always angry like her father. Thank God Shahzar isn't like his father. Otherwise it would've been very difficult
for me to handle him. Oh, what can I say about Shahzar? I've never seen an obedient son like him.
You've raised him so well. He was very young
when I got married in this house. I've raised him like a real mother would. This is why he loves you so much. Oh, I had to stop Shahzar from going
to that meeting. I'll see what I have to do. Salam, Mom. Mom, I'm about to reach Mr. Salman.
When will you get here? Shahzar, the meeting has been postponed
so you just go to the office. - Okay, great.
- Yes, I'll just come there. All right? - Okay.
- Okay. Fulfill our demands! Fulfill our demands!
Fulfill our demands! Fulfill our demands! Fulfill our demands! Fulfill our demands!
Fulfill our demands! Fulfill our demands! Here, I'm taking this bracelet.
Now it's onto my wrist... - And now--
- One minute! You got it for your mu-dikhai? God, Khala! Look, it's so beautiful! Rameen, give this bracelet to her,
I'll get you a new one made. Okay? It's very nice. Khala, look! I'll have to say. Shahzar's choice
is amazing! Shahzar's choice really is very good. He doesn't like ordinary things usually. He was a bit hasty in regards
to his marriage. Otherwise he had multiple very good girls
to choose from. Shall we go, Khala? I'm ready! Oh, are you going to the office, or... Khala, you know I like modern clothes. I look as if I belong to a different
era when I wear shalwar kameez. It didn't make any difference though. Listen to me. It's better you talk in Urdu
than use this wrong English. Dress decently from tomorrow.
Buy a few branded clothes. I can't afford to buy branded clothes.
And with the salary you're offering me, it would be a big deal if I could
even afford peanuts. Talk softly! I'll buy you the clothes. But don't come in front of Shahzar
dressed like this. He'll wonder which
pathetic family I belong to. Come on, we're getting late. Let's go! Calm down, Maria. Calm down It's your first day at the office. My daughter handles his home,
his business, everything! That grumpy old man, a widower. I have entrusted him with my young,
beautiful daughter. He wasn't worthy of a beautiful wife
like you. He's also 25 years older than you! And he's not very handsome either. On top of that, he broke both his legs
in an accident and is now bedridden. A cripple! I have entrusted him
with a piece of my heart! He didn't value you at all. He should've worshipped the ground
you walk on. Sir, dinner is served. Send Aapa to my room. He's 25 years older than you...
My daughter looks after his home... business and everything...
He's not very handsome either... Grumpy old man... He got both of his legs broken...
Grumpy old man... I understood! I understood everything. The bitterness between me and Tabinda... the reason behind it is no one else
but her own mother. She keeps provoking against me, keeps
feeding her nonsense and false accusations. What happened, Shahnawaz?
Why are you so angry? Aapa, I can't describe how many
rude remarks both of them were making. I told you, Aapa, that for God's sake, don't marry me
into this cheap, poor family, but you? Let it be, Shahnawaz. Your wife isn't so bad. Yes, I agree that she's a little bitter. There's no understanding between you two,
but look, the way she handles your kids, your home,
your business, no one can do that. You should value her. Value! It's enough that I'm tolerating her. God knows where they have come her.
Her mother and her... illiterate niece. Uncivilized. She doesn't even know
how to properly dress! What happened to you?
We have such a big house. There are so many guest rooms here. What's
your objection to 2 people staying here? I have objections! My daughter will live
with that illiterate person. She's going to become like her too. And I don't want my daughter
to become ignorant and arrogant like her. Look, Shahnawaz. You don't have worry about Manal at all. She knows what's good for her
and what's not. And then she has been raised
under my watch. You should be a little more gentle
in your attitude. Otherwise, you'll become distant with
you kids too as you did with your wife. Remember this. Where's Mr. Shahzar's office? And you are? Tell him Maria is here. Ma'am, we're not allowed
to send anyone inside like this. - And you--
- Miss. I don't need introduction,
I told you that before. It's my first day here. I'm his cousin. I've joined as his personal secretary. There. It's there. Send coffee for both of us. - Ma'am, listen to me.
- Right away! - Hi, Shahzar.
- Hi. What's going on? I'm so sorry. I should refer to
you as "boss", but what can I do? It will take me a little time
to understand the office atmosphere. And you know this is my first job. I had a plethora of jobs
one I completed my masters. But then Khala told me
that you need a personal secretary. I refused everyone and came here. Per-- personal secretary? For me? I don't need a personal secretary.
I've just come here 2 months ago. Khala has called me here,
she must've thought of something. I think... you didn't like me coming here. No, no. It's not like that. It's just... Actually, I was a bit surprised. Mom told me you'll be in 
the marketing department as a marketing executive. I don't understand this
whole personal secretary thing. Yes, that's how it was. But I clearly refused saying
that I want to work with Shahzar. Close to him. I mean, I'll learn something 
if I work under you. Show me what you're doing. What's the password for this? Oh, it's on. Shahzar. Call for coffee. Yes. This bracelet is exactly like the one
I gave Rameen. She gifted it to me. She's a wonderful girl. We became
such good friends in such a short time. Rameen gifted it to you? Yes, she gave it to me in front of Khala. You can call and ask her if you want. I tried to refuse it many times, but
she just gave me such an expensive gift. She said it's a little old fashioned. 
I'll ask Shahzar to get me a new one. She forcefully gave it to me. Yes. Hi, Mama. How are you? How's Baba? Rameen, sweetheart, he's perfectly fine,
but he misses you a lot. My child, are you crying? - Is everything okay?
- I just miss you a lot. Tell me, where is Shahzar? He's still at the office. What? Shahzar went to the office today? There was some important work. Dear, what could be so important that he
left his new bride and went to the office? Tabinda didn't stop him? She's the one who sent him. Mama, as decent and graceful she looks,
she's that cunning on the inside. She manipulates the whole family,
specially Shahzar. He doesn't even breathe 
against her wishes. Oh, Shahzar. You're sitting here. And you came back so late
from the office. What happened? I thought you'd come back right after
the meeting and give time to Rameen. You're newly married!
You wasted the entire day at the office. No, no. I didn't waste it. I had a very productive day. In fact, I had a meeting with Mr. Salman
too. I sort out other things as well. That's all well and good,
but there's your personal life too. You're newly married.
Give Rameen some time. What must she think? Besides, she seemed a little upset today. She was a little rude at the
breakfast table, but it's not her fault. Obviously, she must think I sent you
to the office first day after your wedding. Maybe it's my fault. If she's upset, make it up to her.
Talk to her. No, no. Why are you saying that? It's not like that at all. Rameen is
an educated girl from a decent home. She definitely doesn't think that, 
and if she did, I'll talk to her. Don't worry. Mama, as decent and graceful as she looks,
she's that cunning inside. She manipulates the entire family,
specially Shahzar. I've told you this a million times. I won't tolerate any of your family members
in this house. You can help them financially
if you want. You've always done that anyway. But living in this house? Sorry.
I won't allow that. And your sister? She lives here too.
I never objected to that. I don't know what your problem is
with my niece and my mother. My sister is a widow. She has as much rights to this house
as me and my children do. You can't compare your mother
to my sister. I'm not comparing them. 
I've always respected her. I've always considered her my mother-in-law
instead of my sister-in-law. I never disrespected your mother either.
I've always respected her. But in this house? I can't do that. 
And yes! Keep your mother away from my daughter. - That woman is worth--
- Enough, Shahnawaz. I won't tolerate anymore slander
in my mother's name! What will you do? 
You'll complain to my son? What else do you know expect this? All your life you've done nothing
except turn my son against me. And that girl that you've brought on
our heads? What is she doing here? What does she need? A job. Give her a job.
Please send her away though. Sir, in order to pay back the bank loan,
we'll have to wind up the business. We don't have any other option, sir. Sir, workers are making a lot of noise
about late payments. Sir, it's been two days since the strike. Sir, if we fired them all of a sudden,
then the problem will become even bigger. What has to happen tomorrow... might as well do it today.
Why wait till tomorrow? As per the law, sir, we will be
required to pay them six months' salary. And how are we going to arrange 
so much cash, sir? You're already drowning in debts. And bank won't grant you 
any more loans, sir. That'll be arranged. My apartment in Lahore is worth
close to 3-3.5 corores. Let's sell that. It'll be arranged. Sir, think about it. You won't
have any properties left after this. You'll be empty handed. Doesn't matter, man! Being empty handed is better, but... employees' dues must be cleared.
Whatever they're owed, they should be paid that. You do one thing. Go to Lahore yourself. There's an agent I spoke to.
He made a good offer. I'll give you his number.
Go and talk to him, and... put an end to this matter. All right, sir, whatever you say. - I'll go to Lahore.
- Okay, you can go. All right, sir.
