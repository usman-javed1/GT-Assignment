[19.22] I could never have imagined that my father
could be this selfish and materialistic.
[23.88] Everyone has always told me
that he married you for money.
[28.43] Shut up, Rameen! Be quiet!
[35.71] Eat something
[38.65] Mama, why don’t you understand something?
[42.80] Why do you keep bringing food to my room?
[45.87] - How long will you stay hungry, child?
- I'll stay hungry as long as I can.
[53.07] You don’t need to worry.
[55.39] If I don’t worry about you,
then who will I worry about?
[58.41] If you stay hungry, do you think your
parents will be able to eat anything?
[65.53] What do you think of your parents?
[67.56] You think are we so heartless,
made of stone?
[74.43] Seeing you in this condition
is not something we enjoy.
[77.44] It's you who don't care about us.
[79.56] You don't even care about your sick mother.
[82.93] Don't you guys feel pity for me?
[86.18] What did I ask of you, Mama?
[88.36] I only wanted that I could marry
out of my own will.
[91.75] Someone that I love.
[95.22] You yourself love Baba, don’t you?
You know it!
[98.54] You know that when you love someone,
you can't imagine life without them.
[104.42] I’ve made Shahzar my life...
[108.67] And you want me to forget him, Mama?
[111.92] That's impossible!
[140.22] Umar! Listen to me.
[142.24] Listen, Umar!
[144.28] You can't leave like this. Wait!
Wait, I won’t let you go like this.
[148.50] If you have something to say,
say it quickly. I don't have time.
[150.45] Your mother came to me and said
you want to break off the engagement,
[153.22] and you want to break
it off on your own terms.
[157.59] You've heard it right.
[158.79] You used to say that you
couldn’t live without me!
[160.47] You used to make such bold statements that
you can't imagine your life without me.
[164.73] That you can't breathe. But now, you want
to end everything over something so small?
[170.20] Why?
[171.33] It’s not a small matter, Tabinda!
[177.03] Many differences have come between us.
[180.92] I can’t give you the luxurious life
you want.
[185.26] Even if I sacrifice my entire life,
[188.75] I still won't be able to give you
your desired life.
[191.68] Please don’t leave me like this.
[193.47] I swear, I’ll die without you.
[196.03] It’s too late now, Tabinda.
[199.01] You’ve wasted too much time
in understanding this.
[201.44] You're lying!
[203.90] You made your decision
based on wealth, not need.
[207.54] You’re rejecting me for money, aren’t you?
[209.73] - No, Tabinda, I--
- Don't touch me!
[211.85] Don’t even mention my name
with your filthy tongue.
[214.97] You’re the worst person in the world.
[218.01] I don’t even want to look at your face.
[220.19] I hate you very much!
I hate you very, very much!
[224.31] I’ll never forgive you.
I will never forgive you.
[269.51] There is no better way to punish a greedy,
deceitful, and unfaithful person than this.
[275.56] that you bring his daughter as your
daughter-in-law and make his life hell.
[281.14] And I bet he will come running to you,
[287.63] begging for his daughter’s
hand in marriage.
[290.40] He will plead with you.
[301.98] You know, when you love someone,
you can't imagine life without them.
[309.15] I’ve made Shahzar my life.
[365.12] Yes?
[367.59] I... I need to talk to you
about something important.
[370.13] This isn't a good time to call anyone.
[375.04] Yes, I'm sorry.
[377.63] Actually, I’ve been so worried
because of Rameen that I didn’t realize.
[381.95] How is she doing?
[384.37] Yes, good. Thank God!
[387.04] I know what it’s like to lose love.
Who better than me understands this?
[397.72] I...
[400.79] I want to meet you.
[404.69] Look, I know you...
[407.83] you're upset with me, in fact, you hate me.
[411.09] - But I--
- I don’t want to get into this debate.
[415.81] Whatever you have to say, come to
my office tomorrow morning and we’ll talk.
[420.66] Yes, all right.
[428.15] Now you're just being unfair, Mom!
[430.05]  You told me you would help,
but now you're backing out.
[432.97] I’m not backing out at all,
but you know your father.
[436.14] Rameen tried to commit suicide, and yet
his heart hasn’t softened. What can I say?
[442.72] You tell me then. Tell me what can I do
to convince him?
[446.31] Tell him that I'll leave the house.
[448.38] I already said it but it was of no use,
he didn't listen to me.
[453.78] Then you should fake a suicide attempt.
[458.14] Fake.
[459.61] Pretend you took some pills.
I’ll handle everything else, I’ll help.
[466.33] No, no, Mom. That's not possible.
You know he has a heart condition.
[470.49] God forbid if he has another attack…
[475.40] - What happened? What are you thinking?
- Nothing.
[477.37] Look, what I'm trying to say is
I can't risk his health, his life.
[483.25] I understand, of course.
[485.78] Then do this: forget about Rameen.
[491.10] You can either make your daddy happy
or you can marry Rameen.
[495.24] It's up to you.
[499.05] You know your dad.
[505.44] Fine, I’ll go with your first idea.
[509.36] - I’ll tell him I’m leaving the house.
- Try it, maybe it will work.
[524.63] I said no to Mr. Manzoor.
[532.36] Whatever you want...
[535.92] will happen.
[546.13] Baba, I'm really sorry.
[550.24] I'm extremely sorry, Baba.
[556.24] I don't need your apology.
[561.61] I don't want it.
[565.27] But I'll have one complaint
for the rest of my life.
[569.57] The rest of my life!
[574.39] A stranger became so important to you...
[579.01] that you didn't even think
about your sick mother.
[596.60] I know I've hurt you both a lot.
[602.68] I'm really sorry.
[605.32] I'm really sorry.
[611.98] What's done is done.
[617.03] From now on at least...
[620.06] before you make any move, please...
[625.57] think about your mother.
[630.92] She's fought a very lengthy battle.
[634.57] All alone.
[636.54] On her own.
[640.08] She can't bear any more shock.
[649.68] There’s no response
from Shahzar’s family yet.
[653.88] As soon as they respond...
[656.89] I'll fix your proposal and send you off.
[677.57] One more thing.
[681.61] since you’re marrying on your own terms...
[685.19] don’t come back to this house
with any complaints.
[717.18] You're my father.
[721.50] And I respect you a lot.
[725.13] Maybe it doesn’t seem that way, but...
[730.18] I also love you very much, Dad.
[733.41] But today...
[735.71] today I need your trust and support.
[746.44] I’ve always followed your advice.
[752.17] You said...
[755.19] don't pursue law...
[757.53] Get an MBA from the US.
[760.91] So I did that.
[765.51] You told me to join the business, not
to do my own thing, and I did that too.
[775.84] But now I’m a grown up, Dad.
[779.55] I’m an adult, and...
[782.07] I want to marry with my own choice.
[784.51] My religion allows me
to make this decision.
[788.84] If I wanted...
[792.32] I can go against your wishes...
[796.02] and get married
but I don't want to hurt you.
[799.67] That's why I request you, Dad.
[803.16] Please go to Rameen's house with Mom
and ask for her hand for me.
[809.91] Please, Dad.
[813.27] If I...
[815.87] don't do that, then?
[852.32] Shahzar, listen to me.
[854.49] Baba himself came to me and said
he has no problem with our marriage.
[859.84] Now it's up to you.
[861.55] please convince your parents quickly,
because if you delay,
[865.70] Baba will arrange my marriage
with someone else.
[868.02] his is great news, but give me some time.
I need to convince my parents, too.
[874.89] Your parents are not yet convinced?
[877.22] No, no, there’s no problem with Mom.
She’s agreed.
[881.47] The real issue is Dad.
[884.42] I’ve tried everything with Dad, but...
[887.81] he just won’t listen.
[891.42] But you don’t worry, I...
[893.53] I will convince him by any means.
Mom is with me.
[899.29] Give me some time, give me some trust.
Everything will be fine.
[914.65] A few days ago, you were against Shahzar
marrying in that family.
[918.73] and now you’re trying to convince me
to allow him to marry into that family.
[922.49] Tabinda, are you also against
this proposal?
[925.79] I didn’t have any objections;
[927.35] I simply mentioned to him that her
father doesn’t have the best reputation.
[932.12] Otherwise I liked Rameen at first sight.
[935.22] You know very well that my son
is my weak point.
[939.07] I won’t compromise on his marriage.
[942.11] Your excessive pampering has spoiled him.
[945.30] Now he's starting to argue with me,
he’s threatening to leave this house.
[950.28] Right now, it’s just threats.
[952.41] But I’m sure he will leave us.
[955.83] What will you do then?
[957.68] Please, don’t threaten to disinherit him.
[961.01] He’s educated, has a good foreign degree,
he won’t have any shortage of job offers.
[965.75] Once he leaves, he won’t come back.
[969.59] Shahzar became very upset after
hearing about that girl's suicide attempt.
[974.21] If he said he would leave the house, 
then he will definitely leave.
[979.31] No, he can’t do that.
[982.66] He can’t give me such
a big shock at this age.
[985.02] Look, Shahnawaz, if his happiness lies
in this, we should respect his happiness.
[991.39] Before he brings that girl into
this house after marrying her,
[996.61] we need to make a decision.
[1042.96] Do you remember, 20 years ago,
when we went to a restaurant together
[1047.55] when I got my first job?
I took you there to treat you.
[1051.85] How can I forget that?
[1056.94] And that day, you got so angry, 
you even threw your ring away.
[1060.69] We searched for it for so long.
[1064.85] I even apologized to you, but…
[1067.57] you're you.
[1069.13] Always so cold-hearted.
[1071.38] Am I cold hearted or are you?
[1073.27] Time has already proven that.
[1076.18] I forgave you that day though.
[1079.05] Maybe, but I don’t think
I truly did from the heart.
[1083.17] That day, you broke a lot of dishes in
the restaurant, you caused such a scene.
[1088.10] I didn’t even have enough money to
pay for the damages to the restaurant.
[1092.95] It was so embarrassing.
[1094.92] A person in love can do anything, but
you couldn’t bear a little embarrassment?
[1100.18] Is that why you broke ties with me?
[1103.91] I broke the tie, or did you?
[1107.19] You couldn't bear my existence.
[1109.00] My poverty, my circumstances, 
you couldn't bear that.
[1111.16] I don't want to talk about this topic.
[1116.34] Look, Tabinda, if we don’t talk, how will
we clear the misunderstanding between us?
[1123.43] I didn't come here to talk about you and I.
[1126.09] You mentioned something about Rameen.
[1134.09] Well, I wanted to talk about that.
[1136.72] Look, Tabinda, Shahzar and Rameen 
like each other.
[1140.57] They love each other.
[1143.83] But I’m afraid that in our fight, 
the children’ lives will be affected.
[1148.90] I'm not the one against their marriage,
my husband is.
[1152.43] What are his objections?
[1156.23] He’s worried seeing 
your business’s deteriorating reputation.
[1161.22] He thinks your motivation
for this marriage is money.
[1167.10] You know me well. Do you also think
that I'd wed my daughter for money?
[1173.20] You know me. And I know you as well.
[1176.85] This should stay between us.
[1186.42] All right.
[1193.55] Your tea.
[1197.14] I told you, didn’t I?
[1198.59] Umar will definitely come to you to ask 
about his daughter’s proposal.
[1202.04] It happened just like that.
[1203.39] He was talking big—
"I'll do this, I'll do that".
[1207.17] All his pride has been crushed to dust.
[1210.10] Now, what you need to do is
[1211.70] tell him to come with his wife
and ask for Rameen's proposal.
[1217.36] What are you saying? 
How can this be possible?
[1219.75] Why can’t it be? 
His daughter is dying for your son!
[1223.77] No, Shahzar will not like this at all, 
and Umar Hassan will not agree either.
[1228.47] This is a bit difficult.
[1231.13] For the happiness of the children, 
he will even hold your feet.
[1234.47] And this is the time to show him his
place and display your power and position.
[1240.56] I don’t understand what you’re saying. 
How will this happen?
[1243.36] What do you mean you don't get it?
Let me explain.
[1261.63] I have convinced Shahnawaz for the
marriage. Now he will have no objections.
[1265.95] All right.
[1268.42] Rameen is your entrusted
responsibility in my hands now.
[1271.21] You can take her whenever you want.
[1273.74] By the way, when are you coming?
[1277.54] We won’t come this time; you will.
[1284.47] Oh, Shahnawaz agreed on the condition
[1287.85] that you bring your daughter’s proposal 
and come to us.
[1293.30] But how can this happen? In our culture...
[1297.95] I mean...
[1299.27] The girl's side doesn't take
the proposal to the boy's family!
[1303.30] What difference does it make?
[1304.92] I’ve already come to your house once. 
This time, you come.
[1309.05] What difference does it make?
[1312.55] But it doesn’t feel right.
[1315.33] Why? Why doesn’t it feel right? 
What’s so strange about it?
[1320.00] Let me remind you.
Do you remember that many years ago,
[1323.96] my mother came to your mother’s house 
to beg for my proposal.
[1328.10] And your mother insulted my mother
and threw her out of the house.
[1334.11] But don’t worry, 
I won’t treat you the same way.
[1339.43] You want revenge?
[1341.67] Revenge? I would have taken revenge if
I had any grudge about not marrying you.
[1347.81] By the grace of Allah, I am very
happy in my home and with my marriage.
[1351.62] Anyway, I called to inform you 
about my husband’s decision.
[1355.15] Now, it’s up to you whether you bring 
your daughter’s proposal or not.
[1359.72] Let me know.
[1361.20] Have a good day. Goodbye.
[1381.28] What?
[1382.38] Has this woman lost her mind?
[1385.02] Have we ever heard that the girl’s side
goes to the boy’s family with a proposal?
[1391.01] It’s not this woman who has lost her mind;
it’s our own darling daughter!
[1396.34] We all have to bear the consequences to it.
[1401.37] I’ve never bowed my head like this before.
[1407.08] I'm here. I'll go and bring her 
to her senses!
[1409.63] - Sit.
- What?
[1410.63] - Sit down, listen to me carefully.    
- But, Umar, I--
[1413.02] Man, please listen to me.
[1415.51] At this moment, trying to explain
anything to your daughter will be useless.
[1419.01] She won’t understand anything.
[1422.76] I just agreed to this marriage, 
and now if I back out,
[1427.73] what if she takes another rash step?
[1432.50] You’re right, but...
[1435.57] I won’t tolerate seeing your head bow 
in front of anyone.
[1439.16] Anyway, what’s wrong with our daughter?
Is there any shortage of proposals?
[1443.02] Why do we have to beg for a proposal 
at their house?
[1447.04] This is the condition they've agreed upon.
[1451.00] They want to humiliate us.
[1455.38] The marriage isn't even here yet, and
these are the conditions they're setting?
[1459.50] What will they do to our daughter 
after the marriage?
[1476.88] What are you people talking about? 
How is this possible?
[1479.71] They are the girl’s family, 
they won’t make the first move.
[1482.72] Mom, you do one thing: take Manal
and Phuppo to their house with you.
[1487.68] What can I do? They are insisting
on coming. I can’t stop them.
[1492.99] Aapa, what kind of people are they?
[1494.83] They don't care about their self respect 
at all?
[1497.90] Look, Shahnwaz,
every family has its own traditions.
[1502.29] They may seem like very decent 
and respectable people.
[1504.92] They not only seem decent  
and respectable, they are.
[1509.13] Decent and respectable?
[1511.42] If they were decent and
respectable,
[1512.64] they wouldn’t be begging for a proposal for
their daughter at our doorstep like this.
[1516.56] If they were truly decent,
[1518.91] their daughter wouldn’t
have attempted suicide
[1521.09] and humiliated her family's honor 
and respect like this.
[1525.43] Dad, I don't want to argue 
with you right now.
[1528.79] Look, they’re coming this evening. 
It wouldn’t be proper to stop them now.
[1546.33] Mama?
[1548.37] Where are you guys headed, all dressed up?
[1551.63] We’re going to Shazar’s house to beg 
for your proposal from his parents.
[1557.14] What?
[1562.37] Listen.
[1563.69] They should come here, 
why are you going there?
[1566.93] Dear, it's better if you don't interfere 
in this matter.
[1569.78] Your wish is being fulfilled. 
Isn’t that enough?
[1573.18] Let's go, we have to be there at sharp 6.
[1574.98] Baba, please listen to me. 
This isn't right.
[1577.95] You're not going to go there!
This isn't right.
[1580.94] We also wanted them to make the
first move, but it’s their insistence now.
[1584.94] Do you understand now why your
father was against this marriage?
[1589.74] But now we can’t do anything because your
scandal has spread throughout the city.
[1596.19] Now, you have to marry Shahzar.
[1599.39] This is the only way to erase your shame.
[1609.62] Let's go?
[1620.57] Oh, Ammi Ji?
[1622.04] - Salam.
- Walikum Salam.
[1625.32] Oh, how's my sweetheart?
[1629.22] - Salam, Grandma.
- Oh! My sweetheart, my doll!
[1631.61] - How is my princess?
- Very good! Such a pleasant surprise.
[1634.82] You always surprise me. I thought I would
surprise everyone by coming suddenly.
[1640.47] It's good that you came yourself,
[1642.54] otherwise, we would've called you today 
to come.
[1646.34] Why? Is there any special news? And...
[1650.43] where are you guys off to?
[1653.68] We are going to Rameen’s in-laws.
[1657.61] What? You're marrying off Rameen 
and you're only telling me now?
[1661.91] No, nothing has been decided yet.
[1664.26] Can we do anything without your advice?
Actually, you should come with us.
[1668.01] Why not? Of course,
I will go meet my son-in-law.
[1671.39] But first, let me see my daughter.
Oh, she's blushing.
[1675.87] How lovely she has become! How time flies!
[1681.64] - Let's go, I’m definitely coming!  
- Come! Come, you sit in the front.
[1685.04] - Ammi Ji, how is that possible?
- Okay, I'll sit in the front.
[1688.76] - I’ll have the room ready for Grandma.  
- Yes, please.
[1700.13] Please, son, get some cake or sweets 
from a good place.
[1705.26] We'll get both things, if you say so.
[1712.81] This is for our new project 
with Javed ans sons. This is the last one.
[1717.57] Okay, all right.
[1721.75] - Here?
- Here.
[1723.86] That's it.
[1726.51] They haven’t arrived yet.
[1728.69] They'll come.
[1729.92] You should have told them 
we’re not accustomed to waiting.
[1734.61] They should have been here
at the given time.
[1737.51] They don't value time.
[1741.47] - I think they're here. I'll go and check.
- No, you won't go.
[1745.19] Send a servant to tell them to sit in
the drawing room and serve them tea.
[1749.18] We’ll go together later.
[1752.70] Okay.
[1791.57] If your parents come to my house first,
what’s the fault of mine or my parents?
[1796.11] Shahzar, why don’t you understand?
[1798.17] This is all happening because of your dad.
[1800.53] Your mom called my dad to come
to your house with my proposal.
[1804.42] Wrong. That’s absolutely wrong.
[1806.99] My dad didn’t say that. 
Why would he say that?
[1810.48] Because they're feeling insecure.
[1812.87] He wanted to show they're you're above us 
in status.
[1816.34] Look, I've spoken to my mom
in much detail about this.
[1820.53] And whatever she said was right,
Dad didn't say anything like that.
[1824.28] In fact, your dad said that he wanted
to come to our house.
[1827.98] Maybe he was trying to confirm our status.
[1831.58] Maybe he wanted to ensure
[1832.46] they weren't marrying their daughter 
into a lower-status family.
[1835.40] That they're marrying you
into such a grand home.
[1838.76] I am very disappointed 
to hear you say that.
[1843.30] My parents have no interest in your wealth.
[1846.57] They’ve seen plenty of wealth 
in their lives.
[1849.78] Rameen. Rameen, listen to me.
Hello! Hello?
[1878.98] Allow me to introduce myself;
I'm Shahzar's phuppo.
[1882.88] And you must know her, 
this is our darling Manal.
[1888.98] Salam!
[1890.25] - Salam! 
- Salam!
[1899.21] So sorry for being a little late.
[1902.25] Not just a little, 
you people were almost an hour late.
[1910.08] We’re just a little particular about
discipline. Please be careful next time.
[1912.79] It's all right, it happens. Please sit.
Sit.
[1920.21] Call Shahzar.
[1925.07] You know how today’s generation.
[1927.02] They choose their life partner first 
and then tells their parents.
[1930.86] And what is the role of the parents? Just
bow their heads to everything they say.
[1939.43] - Please, take something.  
- No, thank you.
[1942.57] Oh, please. Auntie, you?
[1944.58] - Should I make you a cup of tea?
- No, thank you.
[1947.12] It would have been good if Shahzar
had come. We could have met.
[1950.44] Yes, I've called Shahzar.
[1952.08] "Please enjoy the tea first, then
we can talk about other things.
[1954.87] And I'll also bring out the sweets then,
God willing.
[1958.08] Instead of wasting time on pleasantries, 
why don’t we set the wedding date?
[1969.93] The wedding will be grand,
[1972.31] but if the engagement could take place
in a week, what do you think?
[1976.81] We can't decide everything in one meeting,
right?
[1982.99] We need some time to think.
[1994.67] Umar, I think we should leave.
[2004.14] Okay.
[2006.16] As you wish.
[2009.93] Thank you. Nice meeting you.
[2012.45] Thank you.
[2026.70] Are you out of your mind? 
Do you know who this woman is?
[2031.26] Yes, I know.
[2034.25] Despite knowing everything, you
want to send your daughter to that hell?
[2039.66] She’s a vulgar, greedy, 
and manipulative woman!
[2043.06] And her mother? 
She is the factory of evil deeds.
[2046.89] Your daughter won’t get a moment 
of peace in that house.
[2051.15] She will take revenge on her 
for everything!
[2055.79] Amma, you know what? I've felt that...
[2060.56] Tabinda has changed.
[2063.84] She's not the same person. 
There’s more calmness in her.
[2067.95] And the other thing is, Amma...
[2071.82] our daughter, our darling, she...
[2075.53] she's involved with her son.
[2079.27] She likes him.
[2081.65] In fact, she has even attempted suicide 
for him.
[2085.09] What?
[2086.81] Why didn’t you tell me all this earlier?
[2089.20] How could I, Amma?
[2092.09] How can a father face anyone after his
daughter has tried to take her own life?
[2096.79] Are they in a position
to tell anyone anything?
[2101.03] Look, Amma, I feel very helpless.
[2105.97] She's my only daughter.
[2108.12] I’ve loved her so much. 
I can’t see her dying little by little.
[2112.47] Suffocating.
[2114.74] On the other hand, there's my ill wife.
[2118.05] Don't know how many days...
[2120.14] how many days she has left.
[2122.53] She wants to see her daughter's happiness
before she dies.
[2125.46] - But, son...
- That's it, Amma.
[2130.49] Let me make the decision I'm making.
[2134.35] I don't have any other option.
[2138.31] Amma, we have Allah.
[2140.73] Allah is the One who is capable of
everything. He is the master of all things.
[2143.57] I have hope in Allah that He will keep
my daughter safe from harm in that house.
[2151.93] I have given my consent.
[2155.69] I've told them that whenever they
want, they can come and put on the ring,
[2157.86] perform the engagement ceremony,
and take any wedding date they prefer.
[2164.63] I'm helpless, Amma. Please understand.
