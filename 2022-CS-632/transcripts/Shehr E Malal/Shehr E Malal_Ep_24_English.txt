I am the one because of whom you are standing here. I am the one who brought you here and you have forgotten me. You had promised me that after settling down in Dubai, you will call me first, but you did not do so. You turned your eyes away from me, you cheated me. You are very nice Kamran. You have forgotten me. It is not like that. I admit that I made a mistake. Look, Mara, for whom did I come to Pakistan? For both of us, so that you can take me from here. I am very hurt. Call this nonsense. I am not going to fall for any useless lie. This is the status of people like you. You people do not get respect and wealth. Hey, please, please forgive me. I still love you very much. I made a mistake. Forgive me. Stop this drama of yours and get out of here as soon as possible. And if I don't go, then I will open your eyes.  I will give it to you [Sangeet] ok then tell me but remember one thing when you tell the truth then you will also get trapped along with him because when they will come to know that you were also a part of my plan then what will happen to you, you do n't know, so please cooperate a little good kids [Sangeet] even if you leave him then will you be able to forget him I wo n't be able to call him but I can't forgive him in my whole life if I get you a divorce from him then will you marry the boy of my choice I don't want to marry anyone so what do you want you will spend your whole life alone what is your age right now what have you seen in this world yet you have no idea a woman has to make a lot of compromises in life so what do you want what should I do forgive me I just want that the mistakes that I have made don't happen to you, don't let such a mistake happen that the stubbornness of not giving him a chance becomes a life long curse for you because love doesn't happen again and again I just want you to think once [Sangeet] Shajar  Shajar ji what are you thinking nothing is right [Music] just how is Raman's health she is not well her health is not good she has cried a lot [Music] you do one thing get her to meet Umar she will meet her father then her health will get better this is the issue she doesn't even want to see her father's face on top of that her grandmother's health also deteriorated she had a nervous breakdown due to stress I got her admitted in the hospital well how is her health you are saying she is better than before but I am worried that God forbid if something happens to her then Raman will be left all alone you do one thing get her better bring her here me and Amin also want the same but her daughter wants to take her to Saudi Arabia she is coming back tonight Pakistan Shaz what were you trying to talk to me about Takunda yes tell me one thing it was you who got dad married to mom right yes I did the marriage but why are you happy just want to know  I wondered whether Dad was happy with this marriage and and you had done some investigation of Mom and her family etc. Look, I had arranged your Dad's first marriage as well and I had introduced him to that guy as well I didn't know much about the family but it was a middle class family but why are you thinking so much about this [Sangeet] there's one thing I wanted to tell you but I request you not to mention this to anyone if I want to find out something about Mom's background or her family then how can I find out? Yes, they are distant relatives of Mary. Okay, I'll see what to do. What's the matter Shajar, you are hiding something from me. I'll tell you everything when the time comes. You just take care of Dad and especially keep an eye on the attendant who came here for Dad. You know I am very badly entangled in business matters. I ca n't give time to Dad right now. By the way, you have always neglected Shahnawaz and I love Dad very much. You know and there is no kind of interference in his treatment.  I should not be negligent, I was thinking of taking him to the UK for treatment, no, see, his condition is not such that he should travel such a long distance, what would you do, we are there to look after him [Music] Son, how did you remember me [Music] Forgive me [Music] Today, I have come just to apologise to you [Music] Why are you crying [ Music] If not, what else can I do my father, I never respected you, I never gave you your status, I never loved you, I always thought that now you are not only mom's enemy, but also my enemy [Music] I kept telling you all kinds of bitter things [ Music] I did not understand what you were saying [Music] I understood dad, you kept explaining to me, you kept persuading me, but I did not understand [Music] I wasted all my time, the time when I should have been with you, has passed by [Music] Now I wish that somehow that time could come back, when I could open my heart and show you and tell you how much I love you  That I respect you so much That time will not come back That's why I am crying [Sangeet] That's why time has taught me everything It has made me understand how wrong I was Today I am no more here by myself [Sangeet] I feel better than myself Now I understand why all this is happening It's true It's a reality that Mom brought me up But the reality is also that she snatched away the most important relationship of my life from me How did my father go blind while tormenting her I don't understand anything And I know, I know that she is the only one responsible for your condition That's why I have decided to bring out her reality in front of everyone [Sangeet] That woman did not do it just for money [ Sangeet] There is everything else There is something else because of which she is doing all this I will find out what it is as well Give me some time [Sangeet] Please, you will see that this son of yours will show you by becoming brave [Sangeet] Whatever he has not done before, he will do it now [Sangeet] Please forgive me once Just say that you have forgiven me Everyone, forgive me [Sangeet] Sorry, I'm really  Sorry, I am very ashamed. No one will stay in this house. I will make everything fine. Just take care of yourself. [Music] Your case has been discussed and if we get proof against Rizwan, it will be very easy. Otherwise, in any other case, we will get help from Shajar. I am very sorry Umar. You had refused me, but I spoke to your son-in-law and he is giving a very good response. He is getting your bail done and also compensating the loss of Bakar sahab. But how can you even think that I can take any help from Shajar? Look, don't act on this emotion. Understand, think, the woman whose son he is, this entire case has been made by that woman. The place where I am standing today, the mother of that woman has a hand in bringing me here. And you want me to take help from her son. He is the son of that woman, so is your son-in-law. If it was a matter of a few lakhs, I would have taken a loan but would not have taken help from Shajar. But here, it is a matter of crores that a woman can go to this extent to take revenge from you.  she can do anything, you think about this, first her mother died, then her father left her and went to jail, the poor girl is left alone, why am I dead? What are you saying? You wish you lived my life too and you do n't worry about her. We all will try that she does n't feel the lack of family or anything else. This is your bigness, she considered her a daughter and not a sister, she never considered you as her mother in law, leave alone mother. What are you saying? I don't have any complaint against her, I just want her to keep Shajar happy and I don't want anything else. I was thinking of taking Raman to meet Umar uncle, okay, whatever he did was wrong, but at this time he needs us. What do you want to do, will you support him financially? What is the need? Ran hates her father and you want to support him, you got mad, what are you saying? You see, Naanu, these blood relations don't break so easily and only one real relation is left in Amin's life, Baral and I.  I am taking him to meet him tomorrow Yes, you should definitely take him But right now, please go and take care of him He is exhausted from crying He hasn't eaten anything for two days Shajar, go and feed him [Music] What has happened, feed him Hey, your health is fine, not yours Amma, your health is bad, at least check on what to talk about on what occasion Why are you saying such things that his mood is getting spoiled Sapai got on and how was he making you angry We should think before doing anything [Music] Rami We are going to the police station to meet Umar uncle Yes, Rami I spoke to his lawyer and he was saying that his condition is not good, he needs us at this time We are very alone, you have taken him to the hospital I do n't want to meet Baba, please go back Look, he doesn't understand It is very important for us to meet Uncle He has no one else except you Look Shajar, I can't go to meet him Please go back home now I'm sorry this car will stop only at the police station You will have to meet him [Music] [Music] Baba  Hey son how did you come here you shouldn't have come here how come I am fine how are you do n't worry Shajar take good care of me [Music] I have come to meet you on the request of Rashifal else I would never have come [Music] Son tell something to father why did you do this Baba my mother left me because of you [Music] I am tired of answering people's questions I am fed up I am very embarrassed Baba how did all this happen son how will this issue be resolved unless I say something and you don't listen [ Music] Su [Music] how many days have passed since I came to this house till now I am staying in the guest room of this house 10 times I tried to convince her but she doesn't listen to me I don't think she will ever be able to forgive me from her heart it's not my problem this is not my issue you wanted a chance which you got did you think that if you begged, fell at her feet, asked for forgiveness she will forgive you especially after what you did to her  If you did this, I too did not forgive you. Remember my two things. One, that you should not be negligent in the work for which I have brought you here and second, that Bal should not be hurt by any of your actions. Otherwise, you know very well what I can do to you. I don't like crying and whining every day. [Music] What do they say? Neither of the house nor of the ghat [Music] [Music] Look, I am very sorry [Music] Sari Allah Allah, I am thinking of talking to a good lawyer. We should help uncle. You and any of your lawyers cannot do anything for Baba now. Whatever he has done and whatever proof has come against him, no one can get him out of the jail. So please stay. So, why are you doing all this? I am doing it for your happiness, Ran, so that you remain happy. See, my happiness lies in the fact that I do not want to meet him. I have no sympathy for him. Why are you doing all this? What kind of a girl are you? You do not have even a little love for your father in your heart, none at all, because he is the murderer of my mother and the murderer of his mother. I don't want to have any kind of association with the murderer [Music] Shaz listen to me honestly I feel there has been some misunderstanding they have sent us someone else's reports and they still have mine you come with me we both will go and talk to the doctor see there is no possibility of one thing you know how badly I want to be a mother this cannot happen Mommy is not ready to listen to me at all I also cannot listen to you at this time my mind cannot accept anything at this time it cannot believe so it will be better that you don't give me any further explanation leave me alone for some time leave me alone please you will not go I will go myself please how can one thing happen which pills have I taken oh I am not able to understand how Bhabhi took such a big step Shaz will never forgive her and yes I never expected from her that Raman can do this I am also sad that she took such a big decision on her own and did not even include Shajar, it is possible that the doctor gave the report of a wrong patient, bhabhi is swearing and pleading for brother but mom and brother are not ready to listen to him, you know very well that she has not ignored any of our talks, she never lets us down, but I don't know what has happened to mom, I am not her enemy, I still cannot believe that she has done this kind of thing, look, leave this argument, whatever was to happen has happened, right? We should talk to Shaaj and tell him about the medicine that Rami took, Shajar should also be forgiven, Shajar has gone to the farm house in anger and his phone is also switched off, I will go to the farm house and convince brother, but no, there is no need to go anywhere, Shajar is very angry and she had requested me that no one should follow her, her anger will cool down and she will come back on her own, yes, I am saying that do not interfere in the matters of elders, what has happened to you, I am not a milk-drinking child and for how long will you keep interfering in these matters  Keep me away from her, don't argue with me, go to your room, look Binda, I request you not to stretch this matter too much, if Shajar gets angry, he can take any step in anger, why would I do that, I have never interfered in his private life, I have always supported his every decision, she is not Raman's enemy that she will provoke Shajar, will mislead him and make him take a wrong decision, Raman should have thought about this, he should have asked before doing anything, but no, she did what she wanted and the girl who does not want to take your lineage forward does not have the right to live in this house, anyway, now what was to happen has happened, now you convince Shajar and bring her back, I will convince Shajar, but Raman cannot live in this house anymore, I cannot allow this thing and I don't think at all that Shajar will forgive him, what do you mean, you will ruin his home over such a small thing, it is a matter of great regret, you are also a mother of a daughter, what are you saying, why should I  I will ruin her home She is doing this herself and as far as Shajar is concerned there is no compromise on her happiness [Music]
