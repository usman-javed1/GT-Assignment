Mr. Umar, you destroyed your business
because of your wrong decisions. We can't hire you in our company, Mr. Umar. Mehru, there is someone
in this business sector... who is taking out their hostility on me.
If I just found out once, I'll kill them. Who is this weird person? Idiot! He has parked his car
right behind mine! I'll just go and talk to him! I'll call you back in a little while. Don't you have any manners? Any ethics and etiquette that you don't
park right behind someone else's car! My name is Kamran. And yours? I don't want to know your name
and I don't want your information. Just move your car! Okay, okay. So tell me what can I do
for you? For now, just move your car
from behind mine. Thank you. Actually, I had a call. I was busy.
I didn't see. I don't want your apologies. I just want
you to move your car from here! Thank you! Oh, my God! It's the same guy, right?
He's following us. It's possible he fell in love with you
the moment he met you. You look very pretty today anyway! You just say whatever comes to your mind! Cheapester, loser. He thinks he's a hero
just because he has a big car. Oh, God! Look at him, he look so good! - Drive a little faster.
- No! There's no need. I don't pay attention to such guys. Shahnawaz, I've heard Mr. Hassan
is shifting to Pakistan with his family. Is it the same person who has a food chain
in Malaysia? Yes, that's the one. He has purchased a huge house in Defence and he plans to open his
food chain at the malls here. He also wants to wed his daughters
here in Pakistan. A few years ago,
he spoke about Minal's proposal. His son was studying law at the time. Now his son has completed
his studies though. Aapa, I think it'll be nice if you
invite them over for dinner some day. Yes. Look, I want Manal to marry
into a good family. But I can't take any decision
with permission from you both. Your decision is very important. Yes, I met Mrs. Hassan
a couple of years back. I found her to be very arrogant, very...
And her daughters too. I wouldn't want Manal to go to that house. Look, Tabinda, the guy is very nice
and you don't find such proposals everyday. Manal is very simple, very naive. She's not
sharp like other girls. She's not clever. Personally, I want her to go to a house
where there's no joint family system, the guy is independent and there's
no mother-in-law and sisters-in-law. Where will you find such a guy? I think you should call them over one day,
we'll see. What's the harm in talking? Yeah, okay. I believe they'll ask for Minal's hand
again as soon as they move to Pakistan. They saw Manal at a birthday party a couple
of years ago, but she was very young then. Look, we should think about her marriage
seriously now. Okay, we'll get to it once they talk
to us, let's see. Oh, man. There’s talk of your marriage,
and here you are, reading a book. Who's marriage? Oh! Your marriage, whose else could it be? Mine? Who else is so pretty, so beautiful at home
that they'll talk about? Phuppo is always bringing proposals
of rich men to your mother. But... I don't think she's interested
in your marriage. I'm not interested either. I've complete my masters now,
look after Dad's business with Bhai. I have to do a lot in life. And
getting married isn’t a priority for me. This time, your phuppo has set her sights
on a very rich party. I think they'll marry you off
as son as you're done with your exams. That's out of the question. They won't
fix my marriage without my permission. So what? Are you going to have
a love marriage? Of course! I've no interest in arrange marriages
whatsoever. And I've told Mom that if I marry,
I'll marry a guy of my own choosing. So do you think that your mom will agree? Why won't she agree? She'll have to agree. If Bhai can marry whomever he chooses,
so why can't I? If my brother can marry whoever
he chooses, then why can't I? This shows that there's a guy you like. Tell me! If you like someone,
at least tell me. I don't like anyone, but if I do... you'll be the first person I tell. Oh, my God, Manal! You trust me so much? You’re the only one I
can share my feelings with. Mom and Bhai doesn't have time for me. I thought when Bhabi comes, I’d share
my feelings with her, she'd be my friend, but she doesn't see anyone except Bhai. You don't worry at all.
I'm here with you. I’m not just your cousin,
I’m your best friend.  Thank God you shifted to this house. Otherwise, who would have listened
to my heart? Bhabi coming didn’t make any difference. The silence in this house
was becoming unbearable, but now you can't leave this house. Oh, no! It's my enemies who should leave.
Why would I leave this house? You'll find me near you
whenever you need me. Come here. My lovely little sister. Come here. Your concern is genuine, I can understand. But I don’t want to force Minal
into marriage. I don’t want to impose
any decisions on her. After all, these days,
arranged marriages are rare. Everyone has the right to
choose their own life partner. Yes. That’s true, but Minal is too simple. She doesn’t know how to judge people. Look, so many proposals are coming for her
and you... We're not in a hurry. Shahnawaz doesn't want her
to get married quickly either. And I think we should ask her too.
She might have someone in mind. So, she could like any random person,
and you'd marry her off to them? So what do you want me to do? I want... you to give her some time,
become her friend, get closer to her. And besides... she’s been spending a lot of time
with Maria these days. Shahnawaz doesn’t like it at all. So that's the real issue. The issue is Maria. Why did you twist everything?
Why didn’t you just say so? - Tabinda, you're taking it the wrong way.
- No, I'm not. You and your brother have a problem
with my relatives. Shahnawaz doesn’t like
my sick mother living here. And Maria, poor girl, she came from Hyderabad for a job,
I employed her because Shahzar asked me to. It's good that you hired him. I don’t mind her staying here or working.
I just-- You shouldn't mind it either. Because, like my mother,
you're a guest in this house. We really look after our guests.
We put them on a pedestal. But they have no right to interfere
in the affairs of the homeowners. I’ll decide who stays and who doesn’t.
Just me. Are you getting ready to go somewhere? Shahzar said we have to go for a dinner,
so I was taking out clothes for that. - Right.
- You didn't go to the office? When Shahzar was in the US,
I used to look after everything. Now that he's back,
he looks after everything. You know I was just telling this
to him yesterday. That you should be the one resting
and he should work now. Yeah, there should be someone to
look after the home and people here. Right? You went to your parent's house,
how are they? They're fine.
They sent their regards to you. And their new home? I'm sure that it’s painful to shift from
such a big house to a new neighborhood. I understand. I-- To be honest,
it's really sad. I felt really bad too. No, as soon as Baba finds a new job,
they'll shift to a nicer area. Shahzar and I made him a great offer
with an open heart. But your baba refused.
He's free to do whatever he wants. He knows better. These things matter in the business circle
because the news spreads, maybe he won't be employed
by a well-reputed company because of this. You're so concerned about my family,
thank you so much. I'm concerned for Shahzar. And through him,
I'm also concerned for you. His happiness is tied to yours. This is why I'm concerned
for your parents too. Anyway, I wanted to say that
the diamond set you gave at the reception, please hand it over.
I need to keep it in the locker. It's the only one left. Did we find out something
about the thieves? If a thief is in the house,
we always find out who it is. I don't understand. You'll understand. Have a nice time, enjoy yourself.
Good night. Good night. - Hello? Who is it?
- Hi, Minal. This is Kamran Ahmed.
You must've recognized me. Kamran who? I don't know any Kamran. I think your memory is very weak. Or maybe you’re pretending not to know. By the way, anger
and attitude suit you well. Very few girls can pull anger off so well. You're one of them. Who do you think you are? First you parked your car behind mine,
now you're trying to get chummy by calling. Oh, so you do recognize me. When you've recognized me,
then why are you acting like a stranger? How'd you find my number? Well, if you look hard enough,
you can find anything, even God. This is just your number. Please, keep your cheap
and repetitive dialogues to yourself. I admit it’s a cliché,
but it’s perfect for the moment. May I know the reason why you're calling. I want to apologize to you. I think apologizing once
wasn't enough for you. And if I don't forgive you, then? You'll have to forgive me. And not just on call,
you'll have to forgive me in person. Are you in your senses?
Who do you think you are? You'll call, ask me to meet you
and I'll come running? I’m not from a lower-class family, and my ancestors
are extremely well respected too. Minal, I don't belong
to a lower-class family either. I belong to a very respectable family
in the city. My family is well-settled.
What else do you want? Don't try to impress me with your wealth
and assets. I've seen a lot of wealth,
and I have a lot of it too. So keep your cheap offers to yourself. And there's no need to call me
ever again. Thank you! Amazing! Baba, there's something important I need
to talk to you about. Yes, dear, tell me. Just think as if your daughter
has come to ask you for something. I hope you won't refuse. Sure, ask. Tell me. What do you want? I just have a small request. Accept the offer from Shahzar's family. Look, you need a decent job right now. And there's an excellent opening for a
marketing head at Shahzar's company. Please. For once, put your pride aside
and think sensibly about this matter. I think you accept it. Please. You're asking us to think sensibly and
you're talking like a man woman yourself. What do you want? We should live our lives
on the morsels dished out by your in-laws? We should become beggars in front of them?
Become their slaves? Mama, I didn't mean it like that at all. My dear, whatever you meant... it's not possible. I knew you were going to say this.
I was expecting this. Why don't you understand? You're my only daughter,
my very pampered daughter. You can ask for whatever you want.
Except this. All right. Can you buy me anything I want, considering
our current financial situation? Rameen. Speak with manners and within limits.
You're talking to your father! I know I'm talking to my father. You
don't have to remind me again and again. I've loved and respected him all my life. But after everything that's happened, I
can't give him the same status as before. Rameen. You trusted him blindly your entire life.
I can't be like you! Fine, I can't ask him why he did this
with your business, but I can try to make him understand. What do you want me to understand, dear? I’m just saying that it’s better to work in
his company than in some random company's. It’s better that you go and tell your
in-laws, especially your mother-in-law, that I don’t accept their offer. If I’ve lost anything,
I can regain it with my own efforts. What have you earned with your own efforts
so far? My grandfather left you wealth,
which you couldn't even protect. It was Mama's wealth
that you squandered on other women. What are you doing? You're raising
your hand on your adult daughter? This is the second time you've hit me
because of him. Listen to me very carefully. I’ll not step into this house again
until you change your decision. Rameen, dear... - What do you do?
- Enough, Umar. She got upset and left. You don't worry.
Should I get some water for you? Why don't you want to employ Umar
in your company? Patience, Amma, you’ll understand in time. If you're doing all of this to show off to
your husband or son, you're mistaken. There’s no need for that. No. That's not the reason. If you're trying to demean Umar,
remember his daughter is in your house. Why are you in such a rush? They’ve just gotten married.
Let them enjoy these initial days. Then she'll have to face the
consequences of her father's actions. Oh! I'll wait for this drama! Okay, then. Come on. I don't you understand what
has happened to Rameen. She has gone mad,
she’s never been this rude to you before. How can she do this? Still! You shouldn't have hit her. We've never raised a hand on her,
ever since she was a kid, and now... all of a sudden... She was constantly misbehaving with you. She had no right to talk to you like that. I had teach her a lesson so that he
never speaks so rudely to you ever again. She's disturbed. With whatever that's happened with us... she's as disturbed as we are. What can the poor girl do? We don’t know what he's going
through at his in-laws' place. Where is she going to go for her catharsis? Whatever it is, she has no right to question your character
and your loyalty. I don't know when my daughter
became so selfish. You know I don't like it. Yes, Shahzar, how was the meeting? I've postponed the meeting. Because such an important meeting
isn't possible without you. So I've rescheduled it to 4pm.
You can come by then. I can't come right now.
There's no car at home. And Rameen has taken my car
and my driver. If Rameen went in your car
with your driver, how can she go without asking you?
Call her and tell her to come back. Oh, no, no. It doesn't look nice.
I can't do that. I'll do something. I'll try to come. You please tell Maria to put the
meeting file in my room. I'm coming. So you must've convinced your father.
When is he joining us? Mom, he didn't agree. And I won't talk to him about this again. Why? Why didn't he agree?
What's the reason? Because of our relationship,
because of you, we offered him a very generous package. And he refusing without
even thinking it through. Mom, he's looking for a job himself. Secondly, Mama has enough savings
that they'll live comfortably for a while. Savings? How will they survive
with savings? Your mother needs good treatment,
a good environment. And your father can't afford it
in these conditions. No, no. Baba doesn't compromise
on Mama's health at all. He cares a lot for her. Cancer... A cancer patient
needs good treatment, rather than good care. If he would've joined our company,
he would've gotten such a good package, and free medical too. But really, your father
is very self-centered. He can accept help from his wife
and his father-in-law, but he has a lot of trouble accepting
help from his daughter's in-laws. Wow, Mr. Umar, wow. I'll talk to him one last time. Selfishness... since forever. I know I'm talking to my father, you
don't have to remind me again and again. I've loved and respected him all my life. But what has happened,
I can't give him the same position. You trusted him blindly
all your whole life. I'm not like you. Fine, I can't him why he did
what he did to your business, but I can try to explain things
to him, right? What have you earned with your own efforts
so far? My grandfather left you wealth,
which you couldn't even protect. It was Mama's wealth
that you squandered on other women. She was constantly misbehaving with you.
She had no right to talk to you like that. I had to teach her a lesson so that
she never misbehaves with you again. Madam, someone sent flowers for you
via courier. Okay. See if there's a card inside
or something. No, madam, I don't see anything. Okay. - Fine, keep it in my room. I'll check.
- All right. "For a beautiful girl,
there’s no better gift than this." I don't know who it is. I canceled such an important
meeting and came back home, and you’re telling me that Rameen
leaves in the morning with the car and doesn’t come back till night?
That’s wrong. At least before she leaves, she
should ask you or Phuppo for permission. What can I say? And anyway, I... don’t
believe in formalities or restrictions. A person should be responsible
and take care of themselves. Look at me. I handle business, office
work, and even take care of the house. Your father has never had
any complaints in this regard. He's never had any complaints
in this regard. A husband should have enough
authority to control his wife properly. Without any fights. One thing I don’t like is
she says "you" very casually. Have you ever seen me say that
to your father? Talk to her, it doesn't look nice. I think you're right. I think it’s time I talk to Rameen openly. I’ll talk to her now. Talk carefully,
no need to make things complicated. Yes. Where did you go? To your parents' place? Yes, it's... I had to talk
to Baba about something. You could've asked me once before going. I should've asked you? What is this "you"? How many times should I explain this to you?
We're married, right? I'm your husband. Talk to me with respect. It looks better,
looks appropriate. Shahzar, I've been noticing
since the last few days... ever since my parents
got into this crisis... you've started disliking everything I say,
every habit I have. This has nothing to do
with your parents' crisis. These are basic etiquette that, I'm sorry
to say, your mother failed to teach you. - How are you talking to me?
- How I should've done ages ago. I didn't and it's my fault. Anyway... it's very simple.
I don't want to argue about it. From now on, whenever you leave the house,
make sure to get permission from me or mom. In fact, not me. Get permission from Mom. Because she's the one who makes decisions
for this house. And listen very carefully.
The atmosphere of our home isn't like this. The daughters and daughters-in-law
of our home don't go without permission. But I haven't been brought up like that. Where I've come from, I didn't have
to ask anyone before going anywhere. And besides, Shahzar, if this rule doesn't
apply to your sister, your cousin, then why am I being restricted? This isn't a restriction, man.
What's wrong with you? I'm just telling you something very basic. You take car early morning and leave,
you don't come back till night. We should know where you are, right? So just say that's the problem. I made a mistake by selling my car
and giving my parents the money. If I have to go anywhere now,
I'll take a cab. Look, that's wrong. You're twisting this for no reason. I'm only trying to tell you something. I think I understand you now. Shahzar, you're a typical man
who wants a typical trophy wife, who stays confined within
the four walls of her home. - Really?
- Yes. You know what? I can't talk to you.
You always blow things out of proportion. There's nothing I can do. You’re not the Shahzar I fell in love with. You're just not the same person anymore. That Shahzar used to  listen to me,
understand me, and most importantly, he trusted me. - So what do I do now?
- You're just like your dad. - Like father, like son.
- Shut up! Just shut up. From now on, if you say
anything about my father, I’ll say things about your father
that you won’t be able to bear. These flowers are for you. - Do you know who sent them?
- I don’t know. The watchman gave them to me,
said they were for you. Okay, go. For a beautiful girl,
there’s no better gift than flowers. - Hello?
- Have you sent these flowers? Yes. I hope you like them. How did you get my address? Look, I don’t want to
keep repeating myself, but for your information, if someone loves someone,
they keep track of them. You're an extremely cheap, despicable
and useless person. And for your kind information, I’ve already
thrown away the flowers you sent me. Because anything you
send means nothing to me. So, don’t send anything
to my house again, or I’ll report tell my brother
and report you. Oh, that’s a good thing. The thing I wanted to talk about,
I’ll talk to your brother now. Really? What will you say to my brother? That I really like you. and I want to marry your sister. I don’t even know you,
and you’re talking about marriage. I called to get to know you. I want to meet you. I want to get to know you
and tell you about myself. Oh, just shut up. He sent you flowers with so much love
and you threw them into the dustbin. You're very cold-hearted.
You broke the poor guy's heart. If a strangers sent you flowers,
will you accept it, huh? I'm not so lucky that a person like him
will send me flowers. Why are you saying that? I'm neither as beautiful as you are,
nor am I that rich. And I'm not the daughter
of someone like Shahnawaz Uncle either. There's not even a
middle-class man in my destiny. And look at yourself. You got such a good person
without even doing anything. He has lost his mind over
in first glance. I didn't set him up,
I don't even know how to. He's after me.
He keeps messaging again and again. So try to understand it! He likes you. How can you be so sure about this? Man! What does it mean
when a guy sends a girl flowers? He's expressing his feeling for you. And indirectly, he has proposed to you too. I'd suggest you meet him once. I'd meet him, but... No ifs and buts. You'll have to meet him. Just meet him and see.
What's if he's a really good person? And you understand
someone once you meet them. You shouldn't waste an opportunity 
like that. What if Mom found out? Why are you always scared of your
mom like a kid? You're an adult now. Girls your age date around.
In fact, they get married for love too. And honestly? If you left this decision on your mom,
she'll find some idiot for you. What do you mean? Man, I've heard it with my own sinful ears. She was talking to your grandmother. - She's looking at stay at home son-in-law.
- A stay at home son-in-law? How can Mom do this? You know your mother really well. She can ever use her own kids
for her gain. If Shahzar can marry someone of his
own choice, despite being her stepson, then you can too. Think about it. So should I meet him? Yes! In fact, I think you should meet him
as soon as possible. Look... I'm not just your cousin. 
I'm like an elder sister to you. All of your secrets will be safe with me. I won't share your secrets with anyone,
don't worry.
