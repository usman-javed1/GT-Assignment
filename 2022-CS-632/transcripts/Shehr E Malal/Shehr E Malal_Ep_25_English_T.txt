[7.08] Mera dil to sher-e-
[10.08] malal
[12.60] hai please forgive me, I am afraid, why don't I
[15.00] cry, what else can I do I
[21.04] never respected my father, you
[24.68] are my greatness, son, that you
[28.08] considered him as your daughter and not your sister
[32.75] [Music]
[45.58] [Music]
[57.89] [Music]
[64.80] Yes, listen to me, if you are not coming,
[67.40] then I am coming there hello, he switched
[71.72] off the phone, I don't know what is the
[75.96] matter, he is not listening to me at all, I have been
[78.32] feeling this attitude of his since a long time, he is feeling upset with you, is
[83.64] he angry with you? No,
[86.28] why would he be angry with me, there is nothing like that,
[88.52] but this night his behaviour has
[91.40] changed with me, really, he is a little aloof,
[93.88] but he has gone because of the farm house and the ranch, I
[96.88] think they had a fight, did you talk about
[101.56] divorcing Raman, I
[105.20] think I won't need to tell him, maybe
[107.44] this work will happen on its own,
[109.68] it's good,
[120.24] where are you, you have no idea, how much we all are
[124.28] worried for you,
[126.40] I had even told you that you had messaged at the farm house
[129.20] Why are you angry with me?
[132.60] At least you should have talked to me. Let me explain.
[134.76] We will go to the hospital tomorrow and discuss everything. What has
[139.20] happened? Are you fine? You have a
[141.80] headache. I will give you a tablet. I will take it.
[148.11] [Music] What is this?
[155.44] You know very well what is
[159.36] this. Since when have you been using it?
[163.28] I am not using it. What has happened,
[166.12] Shaz. I don't know where these have come from. Don't act
[168.20] too naive. I know very well since
[170.96] when you have been using this
[172.56] and that too without my permission.
[176.60] Today is the worst day of my life
[181.24] because whoever I trusted, they
[183.16] all have broken my trust.
[186.96] Well,
[189.20] where there is no trust, there is no love either.
[192.56] [Music]
[207.60] What kind of trust can there be?
[210.58] [Music]
[218.12] Look, this is your document, in which
[221.60] Rizwan had made you sign and
[224.96] it also has bank statements of six months,
[228.08] sahab. And along with it, two weeks ago, this cheque of one or two
[232.96] crore rupees has been credited. How silently you kept weaving a trap against me and I did not even know that if this cheque of two crore rupees was credited to you, how
[237.72] silently you kept weaving a trap against me
[240.76] and I did not even know.  If the
[245.00] cheque was not credited,
[249.32] I could have saved you, but
[252.84] have faith in Allah, Insha Taala,
[256.00] he will find a way out because he is with the truth
[266.14] [Music]
[273.15] [Music]
[278.32] Shajar
[280.36] Shajar son, for such a small matter, you asked him to leave the
[283.80] house, what happened?
[286.95] [Music]
[291.36] You don't even want to see his face, I ca
[294.68] n't even tolerate him in front of me.
[297.08] What do you mean by
[301.16] this house is as much yours as it is his,
[303.80] but remember marriage is not a joke,
[307.40] understand, you have to make big sacrifices, you have to
[310.48] compromise, only then the matter
[313.40] works,
[315.32] forgive his mistake and broaden your heart.
[318.36] I cannot forgive him
[321.52] because he did all this without asking me,
[324.16] without consulting me, what do you
[327.04] mean, so
[330.56] what do you want now, you
[333.48] tell me nothing, I cannot forgive him,
[340.36] you are seeing the condition of the house,
[344.16] first we went through Manal's troubles,
[349.00] Shahnawaz is ill and Grameen's
[353.56] father is
[355.32] in jail, you should act wisely, listen to me, don't
[362.32] worry, whatever decision I take, I will
[365.92] do it after thinking, but I need some time, I
[369.00] need some time.  In which I can think
[372.16] what decision I have to take
[377.32] Shajar where are you going listen to me
[383.24] [Sangeet]
[386.04] Shajar I am very worried Amma has gone
[389.68] out in a lot of anger don't know
[391.48] where he has gone I was calling but the phone is also
[393.84] off I am afraid that he might have
[397.84] seen the medicine lying in the door and then he has
[400.08] left after fighting with Ramin
[403.68] hey brother find out what is the fight about these
[407.96] two, these days he has
[411.16] started behaving differently from you also
[413.80] not because of me but because of Brahmin you
[417.52] know very well that after marriage there is
[420.84] so much tension in the house because of Raan's domestic issues
[422.80] Shajar has not got even a second of peace
[425.87] [Sangeet]
[442.71] [Sangeet]
[447.88] it means that Shajar is going to divorce Raman soon that
[453.28] time is about to come
[459.32] Shajar's heart is filled with Raan finally
[463.56] this will happen there will be divorce why are
[466.24] you playing this dirty game with Raman
[468.16] tell me what have I done I have
[472.28] heard everything between you both to make
[477.76] Shajar feel
[480.40] bad about Raman this dirty
[483.08] game you are playing is injustice  I will never let this happen
[485.44] with Raman. Remember what I said.
[487.28] I thought you were a very decent and
[489.44] educated woman, but you
[492.56] turned out to be such a cheap and mean woman. I did
[496.40] not understand what you are saying. What have you done?
[498.72] I am asking me what have you done.
[502.64] First you made the doctors' report wrong.
[505.72] After that you got tablets placed in her bedroom.
[510.16] Then you are asking me what have you done. What have you done, what have
[512.80] you not done. You are planning to
[516.56] remove Raman from Shajar's heart just to make her hate him.
[520.92] You are misunderstanding. I am
[524.16] myself worried as to what is the matter that
[527.68] they are fighting. Tab has brought
[530.96] him to her home with so much love.
[535.12] Why would she hate him? You are
[538.96] blaming her, my daughter. This is
[541.84] not an accusation. This is the truth. And very soon this truth will be
[546.00] revealed. I will tell Shajar myself. I will
[549.08] tell you. You are
[550.80] elder to me. I respect you a lot. That is why I am
[554.96] listening to all this.
[558.08] Otherwise, no one has the need to
[560.56] talk to me in this tone. And as for the
[563.80] matter,  As for Shajar, if he comes to know that you are making such
[566.44] cheap allegations on me then go and
[569.60] tell Shajar, but remember your
[573.76] reality is going to be revealed now, when Shajar will come to know
[577.40] about you, he will start hating you, he will
[580.16] not even look at your face
[582.76] ever, if Shajar hates anyone in this world
[586.08] or listens to anyone or
[588.12] believes in anyone, then it is only me, whatever your heart
[591.80] desires, tell me by putting false or true words, you have
[594.52] my permission, she
[597.56] also used to praise you a lot to
[602.48] people, she used to
[607.12] talk about your love to people, she used to give examples of you, she used to
[610.08] fight with her brother and you,
[614.40] this
[615.64] turned out to be a matter of great regret, it is
[618.40] my mistake, it is my mistake that I got
[621.80] you married to my brother,
[624.32] I was very happy, very
[626.80] happy that after years, after mother,
[631.84] Shajar got a person who would love her,
[636.00] but today
[638.76] after years this misunderstanding has been cleared,
[645.60] another new
[649.44] curse, let me speak, nothing will happen
[665.56] Shaj listen to me, I feel that there has been
[668.88] some misunderstanding, they
[670.36] sent someone else's report to us and mine is
[672.00] still with them, you come with me,
[674.04] we  Both of them go and talk to the doctor. This ca
[676.52] n't happen. Even mom is
[678.88] not ready to listen to me. I also can't listen to you right now.
[680.56] My mind can't
[683.48] accept or believe anything right now.
[684.96] So it would
[687.76] be better if you tell Majeed to
[690.24] leave me alone for some time.
[695.00] Please, you won't go. I would go myself.
[699.20] Shaz please one
[700.69] [sangeet] bye. What is it?
[707.64] You know very well
[712.52] what is it. Since when have you been using it?
[716.96] I am not using it. What has happened
[719.76] Shajar? I don't know where has it come from. Don't act so
[721.84] naive. I know very well since
[724.88] when have you been using it. And that
[726.40] too without my permission. Today is the
[729.92] worst
[731.48] day of my life because whoever I used to love, they
[734.44] all have broken my love.
[738.20] Okay,
[740.52] where there is no love, there is no love
[746.19] [sangeet]
[750.08] Shaz beta, you asked her to leave the house for such a small thing.
[753.52] What happened to you?
[758.00] This house is as much yours as it is hers. But
[761.24] remember, marriage is no joke.  Do you
[764.64] understand that you have to make big sacrifices, you have to
[767.56] compromise, only then the
[770.52] car starts moving,
[773.20] forgive his mistake and be kind to him, his
[782.84] phone is off, I don't know where he has gone, he must have gone to the
[785.32] farm house, that day I went
[788.12] there in anger, no, he is
[790.48] not at the farm house,
[793.24] I called the watchman and found out, he did not
[795.36] come there,
[796.52] so where could he have gone, I don't know, he must have
[800.72] gone to some friend of his, well,
[803.44] wherever he is, you go to him and
[805.80] talk to him, this woman will make him proud, call his
[809.76] friends, find out where he is,
[812.24] Amma, he has so many friends, whom will I
[814.44] call, no, no, I can't, you call
[817.56] Mamu, find out about him, his phone is
[820.00] off, I have to meet him, I have to talk about something very important,
[822.60] about Umar's case, the
[826.84] lawyer that Umar has hired is investigating day and night,
[829.64] he might find
[831.52] some proof against me, that's why I used to tell
[833.36] you
[835.92] not to go so far in your enmity with Umar,
[839.40] now I will also starve along with you,
[841.04] you have axed your own feet,
[844.88] now I will do it for you  I call Mamu
[847.84] and ask him to find a solution. His
[850.84] phone is also off. His address is not there at home. I don't
[853.04] know where he has gone. Let's
[855.64] try
[856.68] [Music] Ran
[862.08] Ran beta, where are you going
[865.48] beta, listen to me. What's the point of
[867.64] staying when Shajar doesn't have me. Wait son, just
[872.04] listen to me. There's no
[874.20] point in staying. I have
[876.80] tolerated a lot now. I don't know
[879.16] why he has left his house. I would have
[880.88] gone myself son. He left in anger.
[882.76] He will come in the morning. He will apologise to you. I am no
[885.48] longer interested in his apology.
[889.88] Not at all. Please Pappu, let me go. But son,
[894.04] I won't let you go anywhere.
[896.48] You do this. I will
[898.20] drop you at my apartment and when your
[900.20] anger cools down, you come back. Papa, there's no
[902.76] need to trouble you. I will
[904.48] stay at my friend's house. There's no
[907.08] need for you to go anywhere. I
[908.72] understand. You see, whatever is mine,
[913.00] yours, belongs to Manal and Shajar. I don't have
[916.56] any family, son. And I
[918.64] consider you my daughter, not my daughter-in-law.
[921.68] If you think of me as your daughter, please let
[926.00] me go. It is not right for me to stay here anymore.
[928.08] You are very stubborn. You are just
[932.00] as stubborn as Shajar. You too don't
[934.20] stop at anything that he gets stuck on. Come on, I will
[937.32] drop you at my apartment. Come
[939.20] with me.
[941.71] [Music]
[946.64] Come, hello brother, the curse has stopped. She
[951.48] left on her own. You didn't have to do anything. Wow,
[954.44] I am worried about Shir. I don't know where she is.
[957.72] Her phone is also off. I am very worried.
[960.00] Amma, if I can talk to her once, I will feel
[961.80] relieved. What has happened? You are getting
[964.92] worried as if she is your own child. What are
[967.36] you saying? What do you think? I do
[971.16] n't care about Shajar. He doesn't mean anything to me.
[974.52] Okay, I married Ran for some other
[978.16] reason, but I cannot lose Shir.
[981.08] His importance to me is something that
[984.20] none of you can understand or know. It is a
[987.36] different matter that I am not his biological mother.
[991.20] He is not my biological blood. But perhaps
[995.60] I have loved him more than a biological mother. The
[999.84] whole world is against me.  I don't care if he
[1004.12] turns his back on me,
[1008.92] I won't be able to tolerate it
[1011.29] [Music]
[1015.32] Ta Banda
[1019.00] son, he is your child and will be yours, do
[1023.20] n't worry, he will come back to you
[1030.55] [Music]
[1032.96] Raman, now you can stay in this flat as long as you want,
[1037.64] son, all the things you need are here, there are
[1040.52] two servants, but son, if
[1043.80] you still need anything, you can call me, do you have
[1050.28] any idea where Shajar
[1053.60] would be, I don't know about Shajar right now,
[1057.00] but Shahnawaz is also
[1060.84] not aware of his absence,
[1062.64] please stay here, don't go back with me,
[1069.68] son, you know that I ca
[1072.92] n't leave Shahnawaz alone in this condition, he
[1075.56] needs me and I can't leave him at the mercy of the servants,
[1078.96] neither is aunty there, why do
[1081.56] you need to go to take care of him, I wish
[1085.80] this
[1089.88] could happen, what do you mean, she doesn't take care of him,
[1098.36] Raman, I want to talk to you about Ta Banda,
[1104.12] yes, he said, I am listening,
[1109.16] today I heard very strange things about Ta Banda and her mother
[1112.72] [Music],
[1114.00] I am very worried  It happened,
[1116.96] I myself wanted to talk to Shaz about this,
[1120.04] but I have also been seeing since morning that
[1122.36] you are very disturbed, Bakul is
[1124.64] quiet, you want to say something
[1127.44] but are unable to speak, what happened,
[1130.12] why are you upset,
[1132.04] son? I
[1134.00] myself have gone through a lot of trouble
[1137.92] [sangeet]
[1154.48] I am not able to understand how a woman can stoop to such an extent,
[1158.80] I also do not have an answer to these questions, so
[1162.32] Binda worked with a big plan,
[1168.84] why does she want me to get out of Shaz's life,
[1174.84] Shanavas's condition is also not such that I
[1178.08] can tell him anything and Manal has also gone through so much
[1182.44] stress, if she comes to know about her mother's
[1184.84] actions, I don't know
[1186.88] how she will react
[1188.62] [sangeet],
[1192.84] you can stay here as long as you want, I was
[1196.52] just saying that inform your family members
[1199.28] so that they do not worry about
[1202.64] you and especially
[1205.20] Bhabhi, if you do not call them and tell them, then
[1208.76] I will talk to them myself, no no, that is not
[1212.08] needed
[1212.85] [sangeet]
[1217.68] no, I was thinking that
[1221.32] I will start going to office from tomorrow  Do infact
[1225.24] now I should go to office regularly
[1231.68] and as far as Ran is concerned I will
[1234.92] talk to Ran Ran too, don't
[1241.52] worry you are a
[1245.24] very good friend you have helped me a lot
[1248.84] thank you so what would you be a friend
[1253.32] for, okay as you wish
[1262.60] [Music]
[1281.08] where had you gone Amma was so worried
[1283.68] she followed you to Hyderabad, yes
[1287.00] I had gone to Hyderabad for some important work, in
[1291.76] fact I have opened a hotel there,
[1295.60] what
[1298.60] hotel
[1300.32] and now I am shifting there, shifting
[1304.80] means brother I have built my own hotel, I have stayed
[1307.72] there so now to look after it
[1309.24] I will have to stay there myself, what are you
[1311.84] saying, how can you leave me in these circumstances,
[1314.00] you know
[1316.40] how much problem I am in, I
[1318.84] supported you in all the good work,
[1321.60] despite knowing so many secrets I never opened my mouth,
[1324.28] but what did you give me, you only
[1327.60] tried to keep me as a slave, no now this won't
[1331.76] work, not at all, what has
[1334.80] happened to you, I need your help right now,
[1336.80] Umar Hasan's lawyer has
[1339.68] found evidence against Baker Sahab's manager, I knew
[1342.88] that the police is inquiring and Umar
[1347.00] Hasan  The lawyer is a very smart man, he will win this case.
[1351.40] I have made my arrangements and have taken a
[1354.92] narrow path from here. I
[1357.80] say the same to you, make your arrangements.
[1361.28] I am not one of those who give up. I will not
[1363.20] go anywhere. This overconfidence of yours will
[1365.12] sink you someday. I
[1367.64] say to you, get Shahnawaz to
[1370.40] transfer Minal's property in his name and whatever you have to
[1372.72] collect, collect it and leave from here
[1375.32] because the day Rizwan is caught and
[1378.56] he opens his mouth,
[1381.60] he will first take your name. Don't try to intimidate me.
[1384.24] I am not a weak woman that I will
[1386.24] sit at home in fear of these threats.
[1388.92] How much did I tell you
[1391.00] not to file a case against Umar Hasan on charges of embezzlement? Whose words do you
[1396.04] listen to? All your life you have done as you
[1399.60] please. Now pay for it.
[1402.60] Give your resignation and go. Do
[1404.92] n't worry about me. You know how to deal with problems. I do
[1407.08] n't need your help. Now will you send
[1410.40] me away empty-handed from here?
[1413.52] You don't know
[1415.80] how many wrong things I did for you in return.  You have been taking a lot,
[1418.36] you have given me more than your worth, I will
[1422.08] take you with me, I will never
[1426.40] leave you, but one more thing, along with those important things,
[1431.80] I also need two crore rupees, I will take that as well,
[1436.16] what two
[1439.72] crores, have I lost my mind

[1530.40] son, the thing is that that guy had
[1533.84] prepared a fake report by paying money to the doctors and
[1537.04] he also
[1540.72] got the medicines, look night I am also very worried for the last two days,
[1544.60] your mother used to
[1547.72] love you a lot, then
[1549.72] why does she hate your wife, why does she
[1553.60] hate Umar Hasan and not Ran,
[1559.48] I have come to know about this, I am
[1561.88] calling you to tell you all this
[1566.43] [Music]
[1573.96] [Music] [Music]
[1599.96] Why have you come here,
[1604.60] Bhaiya, it is important to talk to you, don't
[1608.32] even take my name with your dirty and cheap tongue, get out
[1611.52] of my room Meeran, I agree that I am
[1613.96] very ashamed of whatever I did,
[1615.72] look I am apologizing with folded hands in front of you,
[1618.84] I have made a mistake, look Minal, I
[1622.56] love you too much, don't touch me, don't
[1624.96] come close to me, don't touch me, otherwise I will
[1627.80] call someone and throw you out of the house
[1629.92] Minal, I am your husband, no,
[1632.88] you are not my husband, you are not my noise
[1637.05] [Music] Even
[1642.92] if you slit your throat and put it in front of me, even
[1646.32] then  I will not forgive you,
[1649.48] because of the acid you are tolerating it in this house, you have taken
[1651.84] freedom from you, let me
[1655.84] understand the condition of my dad once, mom, you will beat me and throw me
[1658.48] out of this house, I am telling you
[1660.88] that I am very ashamed of my actions, don't you underestimate me,
[1662.72] just leave me, just leave me
[1675.06] [Music]
[1722.00] [Music]
[1736.88] When the crazy guy woke up and you
[1738.60] brought
[1745.76] disgrace on me, brother I had already told you,
[1748.68] your plans will not work here, get out
[1750.68] of here, shut up, I
[1752.40] understood what you said, I got
[1756.76] scared
[1758.36] [Music],
[1766.60] hey, the one who cheated in love, the one who
[1770.64] ran away after giving the false promise of marriage, I swear, I am feeling
[1778.32] happy till the end after seeing you like this,
[1786.64] brother one thing is clear for you, nothing can happen
[1791.72] here now, there is still time, give up
[1795.52] and go,
[1798.84] brother Manal has already refused to accept you as her husband,
[1804.32] now you have two
[1807.32] options, either you live in this house like a servant
[1810.08] or as a
[1812.60] son-in-law, the decision is yours, if
[1820.48] yes, then wrong
[1825.46] [Music]
[1832.51] [Music]
[1845.47] [Music]
[1848.12] Don't be my problem or my issue  No, you wanted love, but did
[1850.44] you get it? You
[1853.28] thought that if you
[1855.72] begged, fell at her feet, apologized,
[1858.32] she would forgive you, especially
[1860.88] after what you did to her, I did
[1863.88] not forgive you either. Remember my two things.
[1867.40] First, that there should be
[1870.48] no negligence in the work for which I have brought you here. Second, that no
[1873.08] memory of yours should hurt Manar. Otherwise,
[1875.68] you know very well
[1878.00] what I can do to you. It does
[1880.64] not feel good to cry and wail everyday. It is
[1885.80] strange that she kept
[1890.88] taking revenge for her failed love from all of us. She destroyed Umar Hasan,
[1897.32] not only Umar uncle, she destroyed his entire family.
[1902.32] Ran's mom
[1905.56] also died because of this hobby.
[1908.92] All this kept happening and we did
[1913.24] not know anything about that woman's actions.
[1915.44] That woman was not even identified. Whatever happened,
[1918.44] along with mom, her mother is also at
[1920.48] fault.
[1922.96] And now we have come to know what happened to her uncle. Yes, the
[1937.88] strange thing is that Qayum Sahab who works in our office  This is such a big thing that she
[1940.84] hid from us.
[1942.92] She has hidden a lot from us.
[1946.32] But the
[1948.48] game that Mom was playing with us for so many years, the
[1952.44] time has come to turn the tables.
[1956.40] Qayum sahab has
[1959.08] resigned today and has done so with the threat
[1962.56] that he will reveal all the secrets of Mom. He
[1965.80] knew that now
[1970.20] in difficult times only honest people
[1973.68] stand with us. What to do next from here
[1978.80] I don't understand anything.
[1981.68] How to tell all this to Ran and Minal.
[1985.68] How to get Umar uncle out of jail
[1989.08] and how to bring all of them to their end.
[1994.92] I will do all this only then I will
[2000.88] get peace. In these circumstances I
[2003.60] cannot take Ran home with me, so she
[2005.84] can stay with you for a few days. What are you
[2009.16] saying? You are with me,
[2011.80] why do you worry?
[2013.88] Thank you, where are you now?
[2017.80] Sorry
[2020.95] [Sangeet]
[2038.60] [Sangeet]
[2051.28] [Sangeet]
[2058.40] Where was Mom? You were in important meetings. What
[2062.08] happened? Dad is unwell. There is no
[2064.52] one to take care of Dad. Brother has
[2066.36] not come home for three days. She has
[2068.72] shifted to her apartment with Bhabhi and I  I
[2072.36] feel very uncomfortable in Kamran's presence. He came to my room today also to
[2074.40] apologise to me. You should
[2076.88] listen to him, consider his opposition and his apology.
[2079.76] Then we will see what to do. I am
[2081.48] not able to understand why you get so upset about
[2083.68] him. What do you want? Forgive him.
[2085.36] What do you want? I want you to
[2087.36] talk to him about divorce right now.
[2089.64] Your tongue has started running too much. I have been seeing you for a while. Have you
[2091.32] ever seen Shajar talking like this to me? I do
[2097.84] n't know where your brother is. He has gone after a fight with Kamran.
[2100.32] After that, his cell is off. I am
[2102.24] trying to find out. I will
[2122.56] see your dad [Sangeet], how are you? What are you
[2131.28] saying?
[2136.24] Why do you talk like this? A
[2140.00] doctor had come to
[2145.08] me. I don't need any doctor
[2149.26] [Sangeet], it is
[2152.88] Shajar's
[2157.22] [Sangeet],
[2159.76] I am asking where is he
[2163.88] and you have gone
[2170.02] [Sangeet], no
[2178.04] one has asked me for the last three days. You
[2183.92] went out of town for some work and Shajar is at the farm house. He will
[2188.08] come back by tomorrow
[2192.90] [Sangeet]
