[19.11] I’m coming to Pakistan
the day after tomorrow.
[21.32] What?
[24.89] You've taken control over everything
anyway!
[27.27] You caused my children
to become estranged from me.
[29.36] You're right, he's not my blood.
[31.80] But how can you deny the fact
that I stay awake at nights for him?
[36.84] I've loved him more
than a biological mother!
[39.13] I'm sorry. Actually, 
I told him you're coming,
[42.76] I think his meeting ran late.
He's on the way, he's coming.
[46.65] I understand.
It happens. It's not a big deal.
[50.13] - No problem!
- Oh, Baba! You're here!
[51.95] - I know I'm late. I'm so sorry!
- Baba, we waited so long for you.
[68.74] Umar, this is Tabinda. This is Shahzar.
[72.40] - Salam, Uncle.
- And Shahzar's sister, Manal.
[83.32] Auntie, are you okay?
[84.56] - Mom!
- Oh, God!
[86.24] Mom! Mom? What happened?
[89.08] - Nothing, nothing.
- Auntie, are you okay?
[91.78] - I'll get water.
- Yes, please.
[94.10] I'll get water.
[97.32] Mom? Mom, what happened to you?
Are you okay?
[100.11] Can we go now? We'll come back later.
[103.57] - Right now?
- I'm not feeling well. Please.
[107.11] We're really sorry. We... we'll have to go.
[109.64] She's unwell. I think we'll have to go
to the hospital.
[113.21] - I can cal the doctor--
- No, there's no need.
[115.80] We'll come again, God willing.
[121.39] Careful.
[123.42] Bring her back. Careful.
[131.99] Why did she become light-headed?
[137.12] Where did they go?
[138.29] - Go, see them off.
- Okay.
[143.64] It was just a little light-headedness
[223.31] Doctor was saying that...
[226.98] you're going through a severe depression
right now.
[229.79] This is nothing new.
[232.87] It's an old thing. Since ages.
[237.95] I know what's the reason
of this depression.
[241.32] Dad and his mocking tone.
[244.54] His continuous accusations that...
[248.05] you're responsible for his disability.
[253.40] If you say so, I can talk to him...
[256.75] No.
[258.43] Don't say anything to him.
[260.79] He anyway stays away from me.
[264.14] He thinks I've created distance
between him and his son.
[267.38] That's a lie.
[270.01] You didn't do any such thing.
[273.00] It's true that I've become
distanced from him,
[274.63] but his behavior is the only reason 
for that, nothing else.
[277.86] Yes, but don't go and say it to him now.
[281.62] You know his temperament; 
he'll move heaven and earth.
[286.51] His temperament is the ocean's waves.
[289.65] It comes and goes just like that.
[293.47] Just watch. As soon as I go inside,
[296.07] he'll specifically call me over 
and inquire about your health.
[303.40] However he is, he really cares about you.
[323.50] What's going on? Why are you so quiet?
[326.26] Aren't you happy to hear about my job?
[329.27] Such an ordinary job?
[331.29] What do I do about it? Should I put
flower garlands around your neck?
[334.79] Oh, man!
[336.68] You know how hard it was to get it?
[338.43] And it's a big deal to find jobs like these
in this time, madam.
[343.49] Look at your standard and look at this!
[346.11] You're MBA and this clerk level job?
[349.16] You know you're highly qualified.
[351.60] You know what my mother says?
[353.12] My mother says that money
comes from a woman's fortune.
[355.86] Just let us be married once.
Then you'll see.
[358.34] I don’t believe in such
orthodox things at all.
[361.66] A person creates everything with their
intellect, understanding, and planning.
[365.08] Right! So you're calling my mother
orthodox?
[368.29] You know that I'm practical.
You have so many responsibilities.
[372.14] How will you follow through with these?
[373.28] Since you waited so long for a good
job, we could have waited a little longer.
[377.00] I couldn't have waited any longer.
You know all the responsibilities I have.
[380.62] My mother is sick, 
I've to get my sisters married,
[383.12] God knows what else.
[384.46] Responsibilities, responsibilities, 
responsibilities.
[387.83] You fulfill your responsibilities.
I can't live in such tense situation.
[391.82] Just forget about-- Forget me!
[393.91] Tabo-- Tabo, listen to me!
[407.15] Tabinda!
[409.60] - Listen to me at least.
- I don't want to hear it.
[411.62] - If you won't listen to me then how--
- Leave my hand!
[413.99] Why do you get so upset?
[416.31] You know that I can't
tolerate your displeasure,
[418.92] yet you keep getting
upset repeatedly.
[421.77] Look, Tabinda, I can't provide you 
with a comfortable life.
[425.36] But I promise I'll give you my
complete trust and all my love.
[430.07] - You'll never have any reason to complain.
- I don’t have any complaints about you.
[434.69] It's just that you don't want 
to move forward.
[437.64] You don't want to work hard.
[439.19] You make so many grand promises
about love; how will you fulfill them?
[443.05] Huh? If you're going to work hard right
now, then you'll reap the fruits later.
[447.75] What do you mean? I don't work hard?
I don't want to get ahead in life?
[451.69] If you wanted to move forward,
would have lost the opportunity in Dubai?
[454.78] Come on! For God's sake, Tabinda.
[456.20] I can't leave my old,
sick mother and move to Dubai!
[458.62] Then leave me!
[460.59] Tabinda!
[511.33] What happened?
[516.17] Nothing.
[518.97] You're lying to me?
[522.68] Can I lie to you?
[528.26] Now you'll tell me you
have a headache to distract me.
[531.29] Bring me a cold glass of water.
[534.32] Not just a glass of water, 
headache medicine too.
[544.03] I'll get it.
[574.50] By the way, I found Shahzar's mother
to be a very weird woman.
[579.49] I insisted so much that they stay
for tea, she took the kids and left.
[584.42] And she didn't say a word 
about your proposal.
[587.89] Mama, she wasn't well. 
That's why she had to leave.
[590.18] Otherwise I'm sure she would've stayed.
[595.09] It feels to me like she doesn't
want to send the proposal to us at all.
[600.10] And she only came because her son insisted.
[603.25] Mama.
[604.80] She's a businesswoman.
[606.29] So she just got sick because of work stress
and she left.
[609.42] And besides, Shahzar said
he'll bring her again next week.
[612.13] I have much more experience than you
when it comes to these things.
[615.96] This is how mothers of only sons are.
[618.87] Way too possessive and insecure.
[622.22] They're only happy when their children
are doing exactly what they want.
[626.64] Did you not see?
[628.63] How much he was flattering his own mother.
[633.18] One second.
[634.93] When did you start
talking like typical women?
[638.68] Did I say something wrong, Umar?
[645.05] Umar?
[647.60] Did I say something wrong?
[649.82] No.
[652.22] They were good people.
[656.67] Where are you lost since last night?
[660.68] I asked you something else
and you're saying something else entirely.
[666.58] I've to make an important call.
I'll be back in a minute.
[678.42] What happened, Shahnawaz?
[681.36] You mood seems a little off.
[685.20] Did something happen?
[687.12] Tabinda is also in a sour mood.
[691.36] When did we last talk?
[694.32] If something happened...
[696.11] then it was either an argument
or a fight.
[698.68] That's it.
[704.32] I've been noticing...
[706.64] that the distance between you two
is only growing.
[710.81] Now Tabinda has even separated her room.
[723.28] Oh, dear, that beautiful smile of yours 
that I occasionally get to see,
[727.80] - I've written a poem about it.
- Really?
[730.71] You've started poetry as well?
[732.68] Never before did I pen a verse; 
it's your love that turned me into a poet.
[739.18] Read it out then.
[740.32] Yes, I'll read it to you, of course I will,
but after you've made ma a promise.
[743.97] Promise me that you'll never leave me,
that you'll always stay with me.
[748.33] Because with you, the idea of life
is nothing more than a bad dream.
[754.68] So promise me that you'll never leave me.
[756.72] And if you leave me, then?
[758.75] Man, you leaving me is a possibility.
[761.15] I'll never leave you. That's my promise.
Now promise me.
[820.77] - By the way, my parents really liked you.
- Really?
[824.44] They're seriously thinking 
about your proposal.
[826.89] Wow.
[831.94] But I... I'm really worried 
about something.
[835.91] What happened?
[836.99] Man, I was thinking that...
[839.33] if... if Mom liked you...
[843.41] then I'll have to marry you.
[846.27] What do you mean? 
You don't want to get married?
[848.89] No, no. It's not like that.
[850.50] Don't misunderstand me. 
I have to get married.
[853.21] But try to understand. If I marry you,
what else will there be left to do?
[860.98] Shahzar, you scare me sometimes.
[863.72] Look, man, it' very simple.
[866.03] It's only you that I wanted from life.
[868.91] And if I get you, why would I
raise my hands to pray then?
[874.18] Stop reciting poetry and focus on the road.
[877.26] There's one thing though.
[879.36] Only a girl like would try to get
out of such a romantic situation
[882.82] and would ask to focus on the road.
[884.66] By the way, if Mama found out that I'm with
you instead of being at the university,
[889.41] she'll scold me a lot.
Now drop me straight to the university.
[892.78] What? Don't tell me you're going
to the university now.
[895.47] Yes!
[899.47] Oh, tell me something.
[901.72] Auntie didn't say anything about me?
[904.41] No, we didn't talk and honestly,
I didn't ask her anything either.
[909.08] I'm sure everything will be fine.
I think she'll like you.
[913.10] Besides, she knows that I like you.
[916.29] She won't ever say no.
[922.51] - Should I drop you to the university or--
- Yes.
[927.03] Rude.
[927.86] A proposal came through last week.
I need some information about that man.
[933.49] - Are you talking about Umar Hassan?
- Yes, about him.
[937.75] But we've already rejected that proposal.
[940.97] Not about the proposal, about him.
[944.64] What kind of information do you need?
I don't understand.
[948.06] I want to know everything about him.
[950.65] How many companies does he have, 
and where are his properties located?
[953.58] Are they in Pakistan or abroad.
[955.71] On whose names is it?
And everything about his personal life.
[960.64] You'll have to do this carefully
if you want that brand new car of yours.
[965.91] Madam.
[967.41] I can do anything for a brand new car.
[969.83] - Okay, then. Start working.
- I'll get on it.
[991.47] Umar?
[1008.48] God.
[1011.50] How is your headache now?
[1014.82] I don't know, man. This...
[1017.58] It feels as if this pain is going
to take me with it.
[1021.29] It just doesn't end.
[1023.88] Umar, I've noticed that...
[1026.61] ever since the topic of Rameen's proposal
has come up...
[1031.39] your worries have started since then.
[1035.58] No, dear. It's not like that.
[1039.99] What are you hiding from me?
[1042.49] What will I hide from you?
I'm not hiding anything.
[1047.26] You always do this.
[1049.22] Whenever you're worried,
[1050.71] you get quiet instead of
sharing your worries with me.
[1057.80] How do you read my face?
[1060.70] How do you know what's in my heart?
[1062.96] Because I love you.
[1069.63] Am I worthy of your love?
[1074.38] Why are you saying that?
[1077.72] In these 22 years, the love and respect 
that you've given me...
[1082.08] my love is nothing in front of that.
[1085.95] - Umar, your favors--
- Where did favors come from?
[1091.13] You're my wife.
[1094.21] My life partner.
[1098.62] If we won't help each other, 
care of each other, then who will?
[1104.71] Then share your worries with me.
[1109.27] Oh, dear, it's nothing. It's just...
[1112.35] some worries about the business.
[1114.69] Ever since we've come here...
[1116.90] nothing has gone right.
[1119.27] I've tried to make a lot of business deals,
[1122.68] but none of them have gone through.
[1124.42] I've submitted tenders at a lot of places,
[1127.03] but it seems as if someone
has put evil eye on us.
[1130.38] It's a new city. It'll take a little time
to build new contacts and gain their trust.
[1138.44] I think I made a mistake.
[1141.42] This city didn't suit us.
[1144.03] You did make a mistake.
[1146.65] You didn't listen to me.
How many times did I tell you?
[1150.30] There was no need to get my treatment done
from abroad. You wasted millions.
[1154.58] Now we only have this house.
[1157.99] This money, this property, this business...
[1161.06] whose was it? It is yours.
[1165.21] Not mine, ours.
[1169.46] Fine, let's believe that for a second.
[1172.00] Then tell me what was a better use
of this money than this?
[1176.28] - You were getting your treatment, right?
- I think that...
[1179.92] Rameen is our only daughter.
We should think about her future.
[1185.11] There should be some savings for her.
[1188.10] What do you think, 
should we transfer this house to her name?
[1193.61] A daughter's happiness 
is not dependent on these papers.
[1199.27] If you want to give her something, then...
[1201.95] give her your blessings.
[1203.49] That God blesses her fate.
[1206.22] - Amen.
- But if you still want that,
[1209.46] then do it.
[1224.90] Is it possible that you ask me
to do a task, and I don't do it?
[1229.53] I've all the reports about Umar Hassan.
I'll just tell you.
[1234.62] Umar Hassan had an advertising firm
in Lahore.
[1239.42] That's in loss right now.
[1241.75] And he has a garment factory
in Karachi.
[1245.31] That has been sold now.
[1247.86] And he has paid off all his loans 
after selling it.
[1253.37] And yes, his wife has a house in Lahore,
a 3-kanal house.
[1259.73] That's also been sold.
[1261.92] Well, if I say that poor Umar
Hassan is currently facing hardships,
[1268.09] I wouldn't be wrong.
[1270.82] Why was all of it sold though?
[1272.55] Oh, it's a very sad and depressing story.
[1277.56] Umar Hassan's wife suffers 
from blood cancer.
[1280.74] And that poor woman goes abroad
for her treatment again and again.
[1284.85] Umar Hassan takes her abroad.
[1287.96] You know how much money is spent
in medical treatments.
[1290.99] On one side, 
money was spent on her treatment.
[1293.41] And on the other, when he was busy with
his wife, he didn't give time to office.
[1299.72] He made wrong decisions.
[1301.74] Loss over loss over loss.
[1305.60] He has done everything
and this is his condition now.
[1324.16] Shahzar, I don't think your mom
liked me at all.
[1328.83] Because ever since she left, 
she didn't speak to me or call me.
[1333.14] She didn't talk to you either.
[1334.91] No, man, it's not like that at all.
You're thinking it the wrong way.
[1337.99] She's just occupied. 
She's very stressed right now.
[1341.42] She's occupied with the business,
it's work. It's nothing like that.
[1346.28] I've been hearing these excuses
since the last 2 weeks.
[1349.01] Okay, hear me out.
[1351.79] Shahzar, if a new proposal came for me,
[1355.27] and my parents said yes,
so please don't blame me.
[1358.23] They're in a hurry.
I've told you about my mother's disease.
[1362.22] Relax. You just need to relax.
[1364.71] I'll talk to her today.
[1366.16] In fact, I'll bring her to your house
over the weekend. All right?
[1371.45] Fix your mood, man. Talk to me.
[1374.02] - Talk to me.
- What do I talk about?
[1375.51] Say anything. We've
come here to talk, right?
[1378.31] Okay, fine. You let it be and don't talk.
[1381.80] I'll see it in your eyes
what you want to say.
[1384.72] Really?
[1386.04] You read people's eyes and faces?
[1388.45] There's one person in this world
whose eyes and face I can read and know
[1391.55] - what they want to say.
- Who is it?
[1394.19] There's somebody. Somebody really special.
[1398.10] And coincidentally, 
she's with me right now.
[1404.78] Actually, you should've ordered
their special tea.
[1409.14] No, I'm fine with my coffee.
[1446.28] May I come in?
[1454.25] You?
[1465.13] Sit down.
[1470.42] I didn't expect this from
a refined person like you.
[1475.21] That you'll come to someone's office
without permission.
[1479.08] - Maybe you don't know that I--
- I know!
[1484.10] That you're the owner of this company.
[1491.87] You didn't change at all in the 22 years.
[1495.46] Same anger.
[1497.57] Same attitude.
[1500.67] Yes.
[1502.74] Is something has changed, then...
[1505.42] it's just your status.
[1509.46] Your status also changed. A long time back.
[1517.37] I know you...
[1519.49] you're upset with me.
[1522.55] I have treated you very badly.
[1524.71] Excuse me. You lost the right to address
me so frankly a very long time back.
[1530.35] - Remember that.
- I'm...
[1533.79] really sorry for that.
[1539.41] My time is very precious, you...
[1542.08] state why have you come here.
[1544.24] Don't you have the custom of offering tea?
[1547.06] It's been very long since I had tea 
with you.
[1553.21] Send one tea. Quickly, please.
[1564.00] Why have you come here?
[1566.20] Do you intend to rub
salt in the wounds again?
[1568.91] I've come here to apologize to you.
[1571.95] Forgive me if it's possible.
[1574.88] I know that...
[1577.32] I've hurt your heart.
[1580.90] But you also know what
was the situation then.
[1584.52] Saying sorry...
[1588.16] the humiliation and disgrace
that I and my family have endured...
[1593.60] can it be rectified?
[1596.59] No.
[1598.51] Never.
[1602.77] But you possess a lot of generosity.
[1606.28] You can forgive me if you want.
[1609.08] Your mistake is not worth forgiving.
[1614.00] But it's humans that make mistakes, right?
[1617.31] You made a mistake too.
[1623.81] Sometimes, time and life make
decisions that seem beyond our control,
[1630.58] and happiness feels like
it is slipping away from us.
[1634.77] But it is time that confirms whether those
decisions were perhaps correct, and...
[1641.77] we're happier now than before.
[1643.40] It seems as if you're very happy
with your life.
[1646.27] And should be. 
After all, your wife is a very rich woman.
[1651.17] Right as you married her,
your status changed overnight.
[1655.90] And what could I have
given you except for love?
[1659.17] And love is a meaningless thing, right?
[1661.87] Rejecting my love
[1664.29] and choosing a life of
comfort was your wise decision.
[1668.64]  I acknowledge it.
[1670.74] Indeed, praise should be
given to your intelligence.
[1672.99] You were once just an ordinary accountant.
[1675.33] And now you're an owner of
such a big company, touch wood.
[1678.68] God gave you everything 
that you dreamed of.
[1682.35] Wrong.
[1684.11] I didn't dream of anything.
Nor do I want money.
[1687.91] I had never dreamed of wealth;
it was you who desired it.
[1691.48] You weren't satisfied
with that ordinary job I had.
[1694.64] You made fun of me.
[1695.67] You never missed a single day
without taunting me about my poverty.
[1699.41] Wrong! Absolutely wrong!
[1702.13] You did not have the desire to advance.
[1704.35] If you had wanted to, you could have
achieved everything on your own strength.
[1707.85] But no. You rejected me, 
you rejected my love.
[1711.45] And you took shortcuts to acquire wealth.
[1714.49] You married your boss's
daughter to seize her wealth?
[1718.65] My mother was sick.
[1720.55] I had to marry off my sisters.
[1722.53] You couldn't say a few words of love to me
during all these hardships.
[1725.58] But you never missed a chance to taunt me.
[1730.26] Anyway, I...
[1732.99] I didn't come here to say all of this.
I just...
[1735.73] You came to talk about
Rameen and Shahzar, right?
[1741.39] Our children like each other.
[1745.27] I only came here to say
that is it not possible...
[1748.96] for our children's happiness, 
we forget the bitterness between us?
[1753.57] I should commend you though.
You're a very smart businessman.
[1758.71] Measuring relationships in
terms of wealth and business
[1761.39] is a practice of people like you, not mine.
[1764.99] 22 years ago, you rejected me
and made a deal with Mehrunnisa's father.
[1769.74] And now, to manage the declining
state of your business,
[1773.71] you have come running to me to.
[1777.84] Understand this one thing.
[1779.98] Your daughter
can't become my daughter-in-law.
[1785.60] Please find another wealthy client for her.
[1792.79] Ms. Tabinda.
[1795.16] My daughter is my honor.
[1799.27] She is my pride.
[1803.46] You were right about one thing.
That now...
[1807.68] my daughter will not become 
your daughter-in-law.
[1814.22] It's good that we had a
frank discussion today.
[1818.43] May you be blessed with
this comfortable life of yours.
[1844.72] - It's such a lovely picture.
- Yeah.
[1850.11] This is the best picture from your wedding.
[1853.00] You look so happy.
And Baba looks so upset.
[1856.98] Do you not know your Baba?
He's always been serious.
[1861.60] But I never saw such a serious face before.
[1865.82] Mama, both of you are so different
from each other.
[1869.93] But you have such a successful marriage.
[1872.36] You know, child,
[1874.09] marriages aren't successful
because your temperaments match.
[1878.99] A marriage is successful if...
[1882.26] the husband and wife trust each other.
[1886.03] It's all about loyalty and respect.
[1889.18] Was it a love marriage?
[1890.97] Arranged.
[1893.36] You know this...
[1895.49] your dad was an accountant
in my dad's office.
[1899.69] Baba was really impressed by him...
[1902.73] by Umar's loyalty and honesty.
[1905.86] He felt as if there's no better
partner for me than Umar.
[1910.43] I know you both love each other a lot.
[1914.81] But it's just that sometimes I
look at the two of you, I feel as if...
[1919.09] as if something's missing.
[1921.68] As if he...
[1923.75] the understanding the couples have,
the friendship...
[1927.35] I feel the two of is missing that,
I don't know why.
[1931.49] And as practical and serious Baba is,
[1934.99] you're a typical housewife.
[1937.59] I'm really sorry to say this.
[1940.01] - But Baba is very boring.
- But he's an amazing man.
[1944.61] I don't know how you coped up with him.
[1947.69] It's your courage.
[1950.02] He's such an introvert though.
[1952.34] I'm taking this, that's it.
[1954.75] Yours, God willing.
[1956.35] - Salam!
- Salam, Baba.
[1992.22] Understand this one thing. Your
daughter can't become my daughter-in-law.
[1998.04] Please find another wealthy client for her.
[2007.70] Umar?
[2010.80] What's wrong? Are you okay?
[2013.01] Yeah.
[2015.13] Will you get me a glass of water?
[2017.09] Of course.
[2062.93] You're listening to this ghazal 
after a very long time.
[2076.82] You?
[2078.75] When did you come?
[2080.77] How are you feeling?
[2084.60] You're asking me?
[2087.91] Who else is here except you and I?
[2092.51] You've asked me this question
after a very long time.
[2096.68] Maybe...
[2098.55] there's something work related
you want to talk about or maybe...
[2101.68] there must be some very important documents
you want signed.
[2109.56] As selfish as you think I am...
[2112.90] I'm not that selfish.
[2117.75] We've gotten distanced because
of these things that you say.
[2124.47] Stop nursing grievances.
[2127.33] Come to the point.
[2132.31] The important thing is that...
[2138.00] you should also try to forget
what has happened.
[2143.12] For the kids' sake.
[2146.23] The situation at home
has gotten very tense.
[2150.71] You're saying that?
[2157.71] I'm worried about you.
[2160.62] I'll make coffee for you.
