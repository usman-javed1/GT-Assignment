[14.29] Mr. Umar, you destroyed your business
because of your wrong decisions.
[19.18] We can't hire you in our company, Mr. Umar.
[22.17] Mehru, there is someone
in this business sector...
[25.76] who is taking out their hostility on me.
If I just found out once, I'll kill them.
[38.62] Who is this weird person?
[41.19] Idiot! He has parked his car
right behind mine!
[44.06] I'll just go and talk to him!
[55.74] I'll call you back in a little while.
[63.16] Don't you have any manners?
[64.50] Any ethics and etiquette that you don't
park right behind someone else's car!
[72.40] My name is Kamran.
[75.03] And yours?
[76.09] I don't want to know your name
and I don't want your information.
[79.40] Just move your car!
[81.42] Okay, okay. So tell me what can I do
for you?
[86.69] For now, just move your car
from behind mine.
[90.61] Thank you.
[91.42] Actually, I had a call. I was busy.
I didn't see.
[95.98] I don't want your apologies. I just want
you to move your car from here! Thank you!
[159.80] Oh, my God! It's the same guy, right?
He's following us.
[171.88] It's possible he fell in love with you
the moment he met you.
[176.25] You look very pretty today anyway!
[179.19] You just say whatever comes to your mind!
[181.65] Cheapester, loser.
[183.34] He thinks he's a hero
just because he has a big car.
[191.87] Oh, God! Look at him, he look so good!
[201.24] - Drive a little faster.
- No! There's no need.
[204.55] I don't pay attention to such guys.
[220.72] Shahnawaz, I've heard Mr. Hassan
is shifting to Pakistan with his family.
[226.88] Is it the same person who has a food chain
in Malaysia?
[230.25] Yes, that's the one.
[232.40] He has purchased a huge house in Defence
[235.14] and he plans to open his
food chain at the malls here.
[239.19] He also wants to wed his daughters
here in Pakistan.
[243.01] A few years ago,
he spoke about Minal's proposal.
[247.72] His son was studying law at the time.
[250.88] Now his son has completed
his studies though.
[254.81] Aapa, I think it'll be nice if you
invite them over for dinner some day.
[258.70] Yes.
[260.54] Look, I want Manal to marry
into a good family.
[265.56] But I can't take any decision
with permission from you both.
[270.02] Your decision is very important.
[273.68] Yes, I met Mrs. Hassan
a couple of years back.
[278.07] I found her to be very arrogant, very...
And her daughters too.
[283.31] I wouldn't want Manal to go to that house.
[286.95] Look, Tabinda, the guy is very nice
and you don't find such proposals everyday.
[290.76] Manal is very simple, very naive. She's not
sharp like other girls. She's not clever.
[295.23] Personally, I want her to go to a house
where there's no joint family system,
[300.33] the guy is independent and there's
no mother-in-law and sisters-in-law.
[306.04] Where will you find such a guy?
[308.24] I think you should call them over one day,
we'll see.
[311.41] What's the harm in talking?
[313.30] Yeah, okay.
[314.98] I believe they'll ask for Minal's hand
again as soon as they move to Pakistan.
[322.69] They saw Manal at a birthday party a couple
of years ago, but she was very young then.
[329.53] Look, we should think about her marriage
seriously now.
[333.25] Okay, we'll get to it once they talk
to us, let's see.
[345.63] Oh, man.
[346.99] There’s talk of your marriage,
and here you are, reading a book.
[351.38] Who's marriage?
[353.75] Oh! Your marriage, whose else could it be?
[359.96] Mine?
[361.20] Who else is so pretty, so beautiful at home
that they'll talk about?
[365.85] Phuppo is always bringing proposals
of rich men to your mother.
[373.27] But...
[375.74] I don't think she's interested
in your marriage.
[380.76] I'm not interested either.
[383.19] I've complete my masters now,
look after Dad's business with Bhai.
[387.58] I have to do a lot in life. And
getting married isn’t a priority for me.
[391.96] This time, your phuppo has set her sights
on a very rich party.
[396.80] I think they'll marry you off
as son as you're done with your exams.
[401.54] That's out of the question. They won't
fix my marriage without my permission.
[408.96] So what? Are you going to have
a love marriage?
[412.32] Of course!
[413.54] I've no interest in arrange marriages
whatsoever.
[415.79] And I've told Mom that if I marry,
I'll marry a guy of my own choosing.
[421.80] So do you think that your mom will agree?
[426.94] Why won't she agree? She'll have to agree.
[430.26] If Bhai can marry whomever he chooses,
so why can't I?
[433.20] If my brother can marry whoever
he chooses, then why can't I?
[437.35] This shows that there's a guy you like.
[440.67] Tell me! If you like someone,
at least tell me.
[443.17] I don't like anyone, but if I do...
[446.86] you'll be the first person I tell.
[448.32] Oh, my God, Manal! You trust me so much?
[453.07] You’re the only one I
can share my feelings with.
[458.17] Mom and Bhai doesn't have time for me.
[460.54] I thought when Bhabi comes, I’d share
my feelings with her, she'd be my friend,
[466.19] but she doesn't see anyone except Bhai.
[469.53] You don't worry at all.
I'm here with you.
[472.14] I’m not just your cousin,
I’m your best friend.
[474.95]  Thank God you shifted to this house.
[477.26] Otherwise, who would have listened
to my heart?
[479.54] Bhabi coming didn’t make any difference.
[481.78] The silence in this house
was becoming unbearable,
[486.01] but now you can't leave this house.
[488.46] Oh, no! It's my enemies who should leave.
Why would I leave this house?
[493.61] You'll find me near you
whenever you need me.
[497.55] Come here.
[499.69] My lovely little sister. Come here.
[519.09] Your concern is genuine, I can understand.
[523.26] But I don’t want to force Minal
into marriage.
[527.83] I don’t want to impose
any decisions on her.
[531.10] After all, these days,
arranged marriages are rare.
[534.89] Everyone has the right to
choose their own life partner.
[537.32] Yes.
[539.10] That’s true, but Minal is too simple.
[545.03] She doesn’t know how to judge people.
[547.75] Look, so many proposals are coming for her
and you...
[550.56] We're not in a hurry.
[552.09] Shahnawaz doesn't want her
to get married quickly either.
[554.92] And I think we should ask her too.
She might have someone in mind.
[561.00] So, she could like any random person,
and you'd marry her off to them?
[565.56] So what do you want me to do?
[569.93] I want...
[572.80] you to give her some time,
become her friend, get closer to her.
[578.47] And besides...
[580.98] she’s been spending a lot of time
with Maria these days.
[584.65] Shahnawaz doesn’t like it at all.
[588.80] So that's the real issue.
[591.35] The issue is Maria.
[592.97] Why did you twist everything?
Why didn’t you just say so?
[596.50] - Tabinda, you're taking it the wrong way.
- No, I'm not.
[601.24] You and your brother have a problem
with my relatives.
[604.60] Shahnawaz doesn’t like
my sick mother living here.
[607.52] And Maria, poor girl,
[610.13] she came from Hyderabad for a job,
I employed her because Shahzar asked me to.
[614.96] It's good that you hired him.
[617.82] I don’t mind her staying here or working.
I just--
[622.43] You shouldn't mind it either.
[625.13] Because, like my mother,
you're a guest in this house.
[629.40] We really look after our guests.
We put them on a pedestal.
[632.94] But they have no right to interfere
in the affairs of the homeowners.
[637.50] I’ll decide who stays and who doesn’t.
Just me.
[680.93] Are you getting ready to go somewhere?
[682.84] Shahzar said we have to go for a dinner,
so I was taking out clothes for that.
[686.67] - Right.
- You didn't go to the office?
[689.03] When Shahzar was in the US,
I used to look after everything.
[692.93] Now that he's back,
he looks after everything.
[695.64] You know I was just telling this
to him yesterday.
[697.28] That you should be the one resting
and he should work now.
[699.99] Yeah, there should be someone to
look after the home and people here.
[704.18] Right?
[707.07] You went to your parent's house,
how are they?
[709.26] They're fine.
They sent their regards to you.
[711.93] And their new home?
[715.04] I'm sure that it’s painful to shift from
such a big house to a new neighborhood.
[721.17] I understand. I-- To be honest,
it's really sad. I felt really bad too.
[727.65] No, as soon as Baba finds a new job,
they'll shift to a nicer area.
[733.26] Shahzar and I made him a great offer
with an open heart.
[738.00] But your baba refused.
He's free to do whatever he wants.
[742.37] He knows better.
[743.71] These things matter in the business circle
because the news spreads,
[748.10] maybe he won't be employed
by a well-reputed company because of this.
[753.78] You're so concerned about my family,
thank you so much.
[757.70] I'm concerned for Shahzar.
[760.13] And through him,
I'm also concerned for you.
[762.77] His happiness is tied to yours.
[764.69] This is why I'm concerned
for your parents too.
[770.11] Anyway, I wanted to say that
the diamond set you gave at the reception,
[774.46] please hand it over.
I need to keep it in the locker.
[775.98] It's the only one left.
[778.43] Did we find out something
about the thieves?
[781.20] If a thief is in the house,
we always find out who it is.
[785.84] I don't understand.
[787.62] You'll understand.
[788.92] Have a nice time, enjoy yourself.
Good night.
[791.26] Good night.
[805.87] - Hello? Who is it?
- Hi, Minal.
[808.38] This is Kamran Ahmed.
You must've recognized me.
[813.03] Kamran who?
[814.79] I don't know any Kamran.
[817.31] I think your memory is very weak.
[820.13] Or maybe you’re pretending not to know.
[825.26] By the way, anger
and attitude suit you well.
[829.82] Very few girls can pull anger off so well.
[834.15] You're one of them.
[836.96] Who do you think you are?
[839.74] First you parked your car behind mine,
now you're trying to get chummy by calling.
[844.46] Oh, so you do recognize me.
[847.37] When you've recognized me,
then why are you acting like a stranger?
[851.09] How'd you find my number?
[853.08] Well, if you look hard enough,
you can find anything, even God.
[855.36] This is just your number.
[857.27] Please, keep your cheap
and repetitive dialogues to yourself.
[861.88] I admit it’s a cliché,
but it’s perfect for the moment.
[869.27] May I know the reason why you're calling.
[871.67] I want to apologize to you.
[874.46] I think apologizing once
wasn't enough for you.
[878.31] And if I don't forgive you, then?
[880.48] You'll have to forgive me.
[882.76] And not just on call,
you'll have to forgive me in person.
[885.51] Are you in your senses?
Who do you think you are?
[889.01] You'll call, ask me to meet you
and I'll come running?
[894.16] I’m not from a lower-class family,
[896.91] and my ancestors
are extremely well respected too.
[899.20] Minal, I don't belong
to a lower-class family either.
[904.24] I belong to a very respectable family
in the city.
[907.25] My family is well-settled.
What else do you want?
[909.47] Don't try to impress me with your wealth
and assets.
[912.88] I've seen a lot of wealth,
and I have a lot of it too.
[916.42] So keep your cheap offers to yourself.
[918.78] And there's no need to call me
ever again. Thank you!
[929.51] Amazing!
[951.24] Baba, there's something important I need
to talk to you about.
[953.65] Yes, dear, tell me.
[956.31] Just think as if your daughter
has come to ask you for something.
[960.74] I hope you won't refuse.
[966.26] Sure, ask. Tell me. What do you want?
[971.69] I just have a small request.
[974.19] Accept the offer from Shahzar's family.
[977.23] Look, you need a decent job right now.
[982.38] And there's an excellent opening for a
marketing head at Shahzar's company.
[986.45] Please.
[987.68] For once, put your pride aside
and think sensibly about this matter.
[991.83] I think you accept it. Please.
[994.22] You're asking us to think sensibly and
you're talking like a man woman yourself.
[998.71] What do you want?
[999.99] We should live our lives
on the morsels dished out by your in-laws?
[1003.43] We should become beggars in front of them?
Become their slaves?
[1005.66] Mama, I didn't mean it like that at all.
[1009.18] My dear, whatever you meant...
[1013.91] it's not possible.
[1016.31] I knew you were going to say this.
I was expecting this.
[1021.07] Why don't you understand?
[1023.91] You're my only daughter,
my very pampered daughter.
[1027.35] You can ask for whatever you want.
Except this.
[1031.49] All right.
[1033.13] Can you buy me anything I want, considering
our current financial situation?
[1038.61] Rameen.
[1040.36] Speak with manners and within limits.
You're talking to your father!
[1043.98] I know I'm talking to my father. You
don't have to remind me again and again.
[1048.44] I've loved and respected him all my life.
[1051.97] But after everything that's happened, I
can't give him the same status as before.
[1056.04] Rameen.
[1056.96] You trusted him blindly your entire life.
I can't be like you!
[1062.13] Fine, I can't ask him why he did this
with your business,
[1065.23] but I can try to make him understand.
[1067.01] What do you want me to understand, dear?
[1068.73] I’m just saying that it’s better to work in
his company than in some random company's.
[1074.92] It’s better that you go and tell your
in-laws, especially your mother-in-law,
[1079.52] that I don’t accept their offer.
[1083.16] If I’ve lost anything,
I can regain it with my own efforts.
[1088.32] What have you earned with your own efforts
so far?
[1091.86] My grandfather left you wealth,
which you couldn't even protect.
[1095.33] It was Mama's wealth
that you squandered on other women.
[1099.62] What are you doing? You're raising
your hand on your adult daughter?
[1115.01] This is the second time you've hit me
because of him.
[1119.70] Listen to me very carefully.
[1122.14] I’ll not step into this house again
until you change your decision.
[1134.94] Rameen, dear...
[1139.27] - What do you do?
- Enough, Umar.
[1145.88] She got upset and left.
[1155.16] You don't worry.
Should I get some water for you?
[1164.69] Why don't you want to employ Umar
in your company?
[1169.01] Patience, Amma, you’ll understand in time.
[1174.30] If you're doing all of this to show off to
your husband or son, you're mistaken.
[1182.94] There’s no need for that.
[1185.00] No. That's not the reason.
[1187.55] If you're trying to demean Umar,
remember his daughter is in your house.
[1192.97] Why are you in such a rush?
[1195.14] They’ve just gotten married.
Let them enjoy these initial days.
[1200.50] Then she'll have to face the
consequences of her father's actions.
[1203.56] Oh! I'll wait for this drama!
[1208.95] Okay, then.
[1210.76] Come on.
[1212.06] I don't you understand what
has happened to Rameen.
[1214.31] She has gone mad,
she’s never been this rude to you before.
[1218.63] How can she do this?
[1220.20] Still! You shouldn't have hit her.
[1223.01] We've never raised a hand on her,
ever since she was a kid, and now...
[1226.58] all of a sudden...
[1231.41] She was constantly misbehaving with you.
[1235.04] She had no right to talk to you like that.
[1237.38] I had teach her a lesson so that he
never speaks so rudely to you ever again.
[1242.65] She's disturbed.
[1245.00] With whatever that's happened with us...
[1247.59] she's as disturbed as we are.
[1251.11] What can the poor girl do?
[1252.27] We don’t know what he's going
through at his in-laws' place.
[1255.33] Where is she going to go for her catharsis?
[1257.48] Whatever it is,
[1259.26] she has no right to question your character
and your loyalty.
[1263.59] I don't know when my daughter
became so selfish.
[1266.77] You know I don't like it.
[1277.50] Yes, Shahzar, how was the meeting?
[1279.36] I've postponed the meeting.
[1281.93] Because such an important meeting
isn't possible without you.
[1285.20] So I've rescheduled it to 4pm.
You can come by then.
[1288.77] I can't come right now.
There's no car at home.
[1291.23] And Rameen has taken my car
and my driver.
[1294.16] If Rameen went in your car
with your driver,
[1296.69] how can she go without asking you?
Call her and tell her to come back.
[1300.25] Oh, no, no. It doesn't look nice.
I can't do that. I'll do something.
[1303.76] I'll try to come.
[1305.21] You please tell Maria to put the
meeting file in my room. I'm coming.
[1343.69] So you must've convinced your father.
When is he joining us?
[1348.62] Mom, he didn't agree.
[1350.53] And I won't talk to him about this again.
[1353.03] Why? Why didn't he agree?
What's the reason?
[1355.70] Because of our relationship,
because of you,
[1358.44] we offered him a very generous package.
[1361.20] And he refusing without
even thinking it through.
[1363.53] Mom, he's looking for a job himself.
[1365.57] Secondly, Mama has enough savings
that they'll live comfortably for a while.
[1369.87] Savings? How will they survive
with savings?
[1372.98] Your mother needs good treatment,
a good environment.
[1376.39] And your father can't afford it
in these conditions.
[1379.10] No, no. Baba doesn't compromise
on Mama's health at all.
[1382.77] He cares a lot for her.
[1385.44] Cancer... A cancer patient
needs good treatment,
[1390.23] rather than good care.
[1393.35] If he would've joined our company,
he would've gotten such a good package,
[1396.63] and free medical too.
[1398.73] But really, your father
is very self-centered.
[1402.29] He can accept help from his wife
and his father-in-law,
[1404.63] but he has a lot of trouble accepting
help from his daughter's in-laws.
[1408.23] Wow, Mr. Umar, wow.
[1412.65] I'll talk to him one last time.
[1424.04] Selfishness...
[1426.36] since forever.
[1436.67] I know I'm talking to my father, you
don't have to remind me again and again.
[1441.24] I've loved and respected him all my life.
[1444.72] But what has happened,
I can't give him the same position.
[1453.53] You trusted him blindly
all your whole life.
[1456.68] I'm not like you.
[1459.31] Fine, I can't him why he did
what he did to your business,
[1462.42] but I can try to explain things
to him, right?
[1467.56] What have you earned with your own efforts
so far?
[1470.82] My grandfather left you wealth,
which you couldn't even protect.
[1474.38] It was Mama's wealth
that you squandered on other women.
[1486.96] She was constantly misbehaving with you.
She had no right to talk to you like that.
[1492.17] I had to teach her a lesson so that
she never misbehaves with you again.
[1505.47] Madam, someone sent flowers for you
via courier.
[1509.49] Okay. See if there's a card inside
or something.
[1515.72] No, madam, I don't see anything.
[1518.10] Okay.
[1519.70] - Fine, keep it in my room. I'll check.
- All right.
[1532.07] "For a beautiful girl,
there’s no better gift than this."
[1537.86] I don't know who it is.
[1546.99] I canceled such an important
meeting and came back home,
[1549.96] and you’re telling me that Rameen
leaves in the morning with the car
[1553.46] and doesn’t come back till night?
That’s wrong.
[1555.60] At least before she leaves, she
should ask you or Phuppo for permission.
[1560.84] What can I say? And anyway, I... don’t
believe in formalities or restrictions.
[1567.11] A person should be responsible
and take care of themselves.
[1572.24] Look at me. I handle business, office
work, and even take care of the house.
[1577.99] Your father has never had
any complaints in this regard.
[1579.94] He's never had any complaints
in this regard.
[1583.34] A husband should have enough
authority to control his wife properly.
[1587.99] Without any fights.
[1590.10] One thing I don’t like is
she says "you" very casually.
[1596.58] Have you ever seen me say that
to your father?
[1599.01] Talk to her, it doesn't look nice.
[1607.95] I think you're right.
[1610.91] I think it’s time I talk to Rameen openly.
[1613.89] I’ll talk to her now.
[1615.65] Talk carefully,
no need to make things complicated.
[1620.48] Yes.
[1646.34] Where did you go? To your parents' place?
[1649.78] Yes, it's... I had to talk
to Baba about something.
[1655.50] You could've asked me once before going.
[1660.39] I should've asked you?
[1666.17] What is this "you"?
[1674.62] How many times should I explain this to you?
We're married, right?
[1678.80] I'm your husband.
[1680.46] Talk to me with respect. It looks better,
looks appropriate.
[1687.24] Shahzar, I've been noticing
since the last few days...
[1690.37] ever since my parents
got into this crisis...
[1693.93] you've started disliking everything I say,
every habit I have.
[1697.56] This has nothing to do
with your parents' crisis.
[1702.96] These are basic etiquette that, I'm sorry
to say, your mother failed to teach you.
[1707.97] - How are you talking to me?
- How I should've done ages ago.
[1712.60] I didn't and it's my fault. Anyway...
[1716.35] it's very simple.
I don't want to argue about it.
[1719.03] From now on, whenever you leave the house,
make sure to get permission from me or mom.
[1723.44] In fact, not me. Get permission from Mom.
[1726.16] Because she's the one who makes decisions
for this house.
[1728.52] And listen very carefully.
The atmosphere of our home isn't like this.
[1732.76] The daughters and daughters-in-law
of our home don't go without permission.
[1736.63] But I haven't been brought up like that.
[1738.64] Where I've come from, I didn't have
to ask anyone before going anywhere.
[1743.30] And besides, Shahzar,
[1744.42] if this rule doesn't
apply to your sister, your cousin,
[1747.48] then why am I being restricted?
[1748.79] This isn't a restriction, man.
What's wrong with you?
[1751.64] I'm just telling you something very basic.
[1753.64] You take car early morning and leave,
you don't come back till night.
[1757.12] We should know where you are, right?
[1758.68] So just say that's the problem.
[1761.16] I made a mistake by selling my car
and giving my parents the money.
[1765.79] If I have to go anywhere now,
I'll take a cab.
[1767.85] Look, that's wrong.
[1769.95] You're twisting this for no reason.
[1771.99] I'm only trying to tell you something.
[1775.50] I think I understand you now.
[1778.40] Shahzar, you're a typical man
who wants a typical trophy wife,
[1783.80] who stays confined within
the four walls of her home.
[1786.19] - Really?
- Yes.
[1787.25] You know what? I can't talk to you.
You always blow things out of proportion.
[1794.53] There's nothing I can do.
[1799.64] You’re not the Shahzar I fell in love with.
[1803.85] You're just not the same person anymore.
[1807.67] That Shahzar used to  listen to me,
understand me, and most importantly,
[1812.29] he trusted me.
[1813.80] - So what do I do now?
- You're just like your dad.
[1816.94] - Like father, like son.
- Shut up! Just shut up.
[1821.64] From now on, if you say
anything about my father,
[1824.14] I’ll say things about your father
that you won’t be able to bear.
[1844.72] These flowers are for you.
[1848.07] - Do you know who sent them?
- I don’t know.
[1850.02] The watchman gave them to me,
said they were for you.
[1854.99] Okay, go.
[1862.70] For a beautiful girl,
there’s no better gift than flowers.
[1896.94] - Hello?
- Have you sent these flowers?
[1899.75] Yes.
[1901.45] I hope you like them.
[1906.40] How did you get my address?
[1909.96] Look, I don’t want to
keep repeating myself,
[1912.80] but for your information,
[1915.74] if someone loves someone,
they keep track of them.
[1921.10] You're an extremely cheap, despicable
and useless person.
[1923.74] And for your kind information, I’ve already
thrown away the flowers you sent me.
[1927.26] Because anything you
send means nothing to me.
[1930.62] So, don’t send anything
to my house again,
[1933.24] or I’ll report tell my brother
and report you.
[1936.20] Oh, that’s a good thing.
[1938.77] The thing I wanted to talk about,
I’ll talk to your brother now.
[1941.85] Really? What will you say to my brother?
[1944.47] That I really like you.
[1949.36] and I want to marry your sister.
[1953.01] I don’t even know you,
and you’re talking about marriage.
[1955.93] I called to get to know you.
[1958.71] I want to meet you.
[1960.69] I want to get to know you
and tell you about myself.
[1964.03] Oh, just shut up.
[2029.12] He sent you flowers with so much love
and you threw them into the dustbin.
[2033.82] You're very cold-hearted.
You broke the poor guy's heart.
[2037.59] If a strangers sent you flowers,
will you accept it, huh?
[2040.84] I'm not so lucky that a person like him
will send me flowers.
[2044.87] Why are you saying that?
[2046.87] I'm neither as beautiful as you are,
nor am I that rich.
[2049.85] And I'm not the daughter
of someone like Shahnawaz Uncle either.
[2052.07] There's not even a
middle-class man in my destiny.
[2055.07] And look at yourself.
[2056.43] You got such a good person
without even doing anything.
[2058.95] He has lost his mind over
in first glance.
[2061.68] I didn't set him up,
I don't even know how to.
[2065.62] He's after me.
He keeps messaging again and again.
[2070.84] So try to understand it! He likes you.
[2074.60] How can you be so sure about this?
[2076.62] Man! What does it mean
when a guy sends a girl flowers?
[2082.00] He's expressing his feeling for you.
[2085.11] And indirectly, he has proposed to you too.
[2092.23] I'd suggest you meet him once.
[2094.32] I'd meet him, but...
[2096.47] No ifs and buts. You'll have to meet him.
[2099.38] Just meet him and see.
What's if he's a really good person?
[2101.96] And you understand
someone once you meet them.
[2105.17] You shouldn't waste an opportunity 
like that.
[2112.25] What if Mom found out?
[2117.94] Why are you always scared of your
mom like a kid? You're an adult now.
[2122.21] Girls your age date around.
In fact, they get married for love too.
[2126.77] And honestly?
[2129.37] If you left this decision on your mom,
she'll find some idiot for you.
[2132.81] What do you mean?
[2134.20] Man, I've heard it with my own sinful ears.
[2137.93] She was talking to your grandmother.
[2140.77] - She's looking at stay at home son-in-law.
- A stay at home son-in-law?
[2144.31] How can Mom do this?
[2148.05] You know your mother really well.
[2151.37] She can ever use her own kids
for her gain.
[2154.94] If Shahzar can marry someone of his
own choice, despite being her stepson,
[2159.05] then you can too.
[2163.03] Think about it.
[2171.36] So should I meet him?
[2177.93] Yes!
[2179.20] In fact, I think you should meet him
as soon as possible.
[2188.33] Look...
[2190.44] I'm not just your cousin. 
I'm like an elder sister to you.
[2196.35] All of your secrets will be safe with me.
[2202.16] I won't share your secrets with anyone,
don't worry.
