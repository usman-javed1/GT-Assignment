what will you do?
Will you give me a divorce? And after that, will you send me to the
place I came from to this grand palace? Your son is not in your control. If I leave here, you will be
completely left with nothing. Who will cast an evil
eye on our happy family? Where will we go? We'll move to some cheap neighborhood,
rent a small house? Everything should be perfect today
for Mama. God, I can't wait for her to see this. Shakira Baji, after making the cake,
please help me with the cooking. I want everything to be perfect for Mama's
birthday.  I'm making it with my own hands. Bibi, the madam has let me go as of today. She has settled our dues too. No one will be coming in come tomorrow. Shakira, Ammi Ji is calling you. Mama, she says you've let everyone go. That's fine, they are all lazy people. What's the point?
They just want their salary, right? That's all these people want. And now Ammi is here, so there will
be no problem in the kitchen.  She'll help. As for doing small tasks, that's fine.
I'm going to have fun. Are you going to clean this huge house
all by yourself?  what are you saying? You can barely cook one meal.
Please take care of your health. Dear, there's nothing wrong with me.
By the grace of God, I am perfectly healthy. Anyway, tell me, when is Shahzar coming
to pick you up? - Why are you in a hurry to send me away?  -It
's not like that. Your dado has planned to invite Shahzar
and his family for dinner. So we should decide the menu. Mama, it's really up to you,
but I think this is a bad idea. You are not letting any servants go.
That's it!  -I think it's a fantastic idea.
-No.  Do you want some help? No, I don't need any help.
I will manage.  You rest. Lovely girl. Today I tried making a pineapple cake.
I hope you like it. Happy Birthday, Mama!  I love you so much. Thank you very much. Thank you? What's with all the formalities? I celebrate your birthday like this
every year. But now that I'm married,
things are different. "Thank you. Sorry, dear. Thank you, dear." Okay, by the way… Mama. why are you crying? -What happened?
-No, just felt like it. What happened?  What's the problem? Are you sure? Come, let's cut the cake. No, how can we cut the cake?
Let Baba come first. No, Rameen.  Rameen... He's very busy today,
he has a lot of meetings. He'll get disturbed if you call him,
he'll be angry. What kind of business is he doing
that he'll miss such an important event? Today, he forgot your birthday.
Tomorrow, he'll forget your anniversary. - Let me call and ask where he is.  -It
's no big deal. What do you mean it's no big deal?
Relax. I'm just calling his secretary
to find out where he is. Go and stop her. Go, go, go. Hello, hi, how are you?
Please let me speak to Papa. what do you mean? The company shut down-- No.  No one told me anything. We didn't want to worry about you,
so we hid this from you. I don't understand. You people have turned me into a stranger
ever since I got married So much happened with you guys
and no one told me anything. You were newly married. This is why we didn't want to tell you
something bad and bother you. And your father also said
not to tell you anything. This is a mess.
How will all these problems be sorted? You don't need to think about this. Your Baba will handle everything.
He's here. What is he going to handle? He has lost everything.
What is left for him to handle? It's not your Baba's fault. You have no right to
talk about him like this. What do you mean it's not his fault?
what do you mean? He's been handling everything
for the last 25 years, right? These problems must be done by him. I swear I don't understand you guys. I want to tell her the truth. You told her everything.
I even told you not to. Omar, what do you think? How long can I hide such a big
thing from her and for how long? - As long as--
- Baba! Why did you take so many loans
from the bank? Rameen. What palaces and factories have you built
that you took such big loans from the bank? What kind of tone is this with your father? Mama, please stop. He took advantage of your silence
his whole life. - He sold Nana's entire business.
-Behave yourself. Nana gave you everything along
with his daughter and what did you do? -Go to your room.
- I won't go. I won't go until he gives me answers
to my questions. What answer do you need? Why did he do this to you? Now I understand. You have done a secret second marriage,
right? Mama, I think he's having an affair If you ever said something so vulgar
about your father... I 'll ban you from coming over. do you understand? Child... You're organizing Shahzar's reception
with the annual dinner? Tabinda, you made the right call combining
Shahzar's reception and annual dinner. Look, no one has time for these gatherings. This is a very stupid decision. what are the people gonna say? People will mock us for this reception. A billionaire like Shahnawaz... he's done his son's reception
with so much simplicity and stinginess. This is all... this is all she is doing. She must be thinking of saving money. I have no interest in your money. his is your house, your everything.
It's your son. Do what you wish. I never cheated you. Keep everything with yourself. This woman is such a big liar. Why do you do this, Shahnawaz?
Unnecessary arguments. She was in such a good mood.
We all sat together after so long. At least you shouldn't talk like that. You're my sister. Fine, I'm your sister
and her sister-in-law. And as your sister,
I'll talk to you first. If your behavior with her isn't good,
she'll take both children and leave. You can sit here alone
and stare at the walls then. What’s the need for the reception,
especially at the company’s annual function Big people will be there. You want to introduce them
Rameen and his father to such people? Aren't they going to establish connections
with these people then? No, Amma.  They already have connections. But don't forget that when a person's
status changes, their circle changes too. You will see, Umar Hasan will
not get any importance there. They won't even pay him any attention. His downfall is already known. I arranged this so that Umar
Hasan knows his true place. do you understand? Very good. That's more like it. No.  You've given the warning,
but that's not enough. Give them one week to
vacate the house.  That's it. It'll be really good if it happens before
the annual dinner.  In fact, it should. Yes. Please.  This has to be done. And if there's anything I can do
for you, you know I'm always here. I will be waiting.  Thank you so much.
Good bye. Yes?  yes, tell me.  what did you find? I have the entire report. Mrs.  Umar and her mother have over 1 crore
in jewellery, and about 10-12 lakh in cash. They have two brand new cars and jewelry worth 50-60 lakh
that they've given to Rameen, and the car?  You know about that. Find out how much they have
with all these assets combined. And do this urgently. It's a very easy thing to do.  Very easy!
Your Mamu is here. Yeah!  I-- That brand new car... It'll be done, it'll be done.
Why do you worry? It's my dream to have a brand new car.
It's very fun to sit in that. Promise me you're not going
to pay attention to what Rameen has said. She's still a kid, and... we hid everything from her and
now that she knows, she's in shock. I know. She's kid, she's in shock, so... What's the point of minding what your
kids say?  I don't think any parents do. But what can I do about that tone
that pierced my heart? It's hurting. A daughter thinks her father is at fault. -She thinks he's a cheater, a fraud.
- Omar. What does it matter what she says? I trust you blindly.  Isn't that enough? Please.  Forget everything she said. - Okay.
- Promise? Umar, Mehr-un-Nisa.
Shahzar and his mother are here. Why are they here at this time like this? They're not here just to take Rameen back, they've also come to give condolences
for what has happened. What? -How do they know?  -Such
things cannot remain hidden. When the whole family knows,
they must've found out somehow. Anyway, I'll get the tea prepared with
Rameen.  You go and give them company. Yes. It was really sad to hear all of this. But things happening like this,
the bank didn't even you time... Who can delay what fate has written? When bad times come,
nature closes all the doors itself. Don't know who cast evil eye on us. Everything got sold off in a matter of
seconds, a running business shut down. Whatever happened, it wasn't good. I can understand your pain. But... everyone goes through good and bad times. If you ever need any help,
we're here for you. Yes, Uncle.  Mom is right. Think of me as your son.  If you need any help,
do let me know. No, my child. You two... just stay happy.  What could
make us happier than that? It's family that supports you
in your bad times. Please don't hide anything from us
thinking If you need financial help, we're ready. yes, sure.  Thank God the times
aren't that bad yet but thanks a lot. Just don't lose courage.  God is willing... this time will pass too. Tabinda, we're not the people
who lose courage. This is just money.  And times change. You face even bigger crisis in life. I came to get Rameen.  Quickly get ready,
we have to pick your walima dress. Walima? Did you postpone the date for the walima? Yes, we postponed it,
but this isn't the walima. We're organizing a small reception
to celebrate the wedding. It's a small reception.
This is the invitation card. Whoever you want to invite,
we've got cards printed for them.  -Give it to them.
-Sure. The food smells really good. I feel like eating everything myself. If anyone doesn't want to eat it,
it's up to them. It's very sad though. Minal tried to make you eat,
but you didn't eat it. But anyway, I've decided to
sit here all night if you don't eat. - Are you very stubborn?
- I know, right? You're no less. No one will be worse than me
if you go on a hunger strike now.  -No one is worse than you anyway.
- Really? It's very hot. All is right, thank you. Umar... so you've decided to get a job? Yeah, there's no other option. I don't even have enough money
to establish a small business or something. I think the job is fine.  I should get a job. - But--
- Don't worry.  Why do you worry? Look, I promise not to disturb the
lifestyle you're used to, God is willing. Omar, don't you know me? I don't care about money or status? I only have one concern that... the financial bankruptcy
we're facing right after Rameen's wedding, I don't want her to be humiliated
at her in-laws because of us. Look, somethings are going to happen
in the beginning. But they'll eventually forget.
They'll get used to it. - Don't worry.
-God is willing. Oh, I forgot to tell you
something important. Shehryar is coming from Islamabad
with his wife. Shehryar who?  Your cousin? I thought I'd let him know
about our financial situation so he won't be caught
off guard when he arrives. He knew it already. Then they must have said a lot of things
to you. Your uncle was against
our wedding anyway. He wanted you to marry
the same cousin, right? Umar, why are you talking
about such old things? He is happily married now.
He is coming over to meet us. Are you searching for jobs? No, I'm just making my CV for now.
I'll look for jobs later. Big thanks for your offer. But I know my parents' nature. Forget taking financial aid
from my in-laws... they won't even take it
from their son-in-law. Plus they're very strong. I know Baba can handle this situation. Yeah, but you can suggest that he take out
a loan from our company for a short time. Coincidentally, we do have a marketing head
vacancy at the firm right now. If Uncle wants, he can take up
that job as well. I'll talk to him if you say so.
But I know he won't agree. Okay, I have one more solution. The car and the jewelry you brought,
give it back to them.  Maybe it'll help. Shahzar, try to understand. My parents won't ever take the stuff
that they gave me. Their loss is in billions. Then what's the solution?
How can we help them? Look, I know you're parents
are very self-reliant. And I really appreciate that. But they need us right now. I think you should convince him
to take this job. In fact, this is what Mom wants too. - I'll talk to him.
- Okay. Okay, I'll leave. - Okay, bye.
-Bye. Rameen, you keep your advice to yourself
and tell it to Shahzar too. We don't need any advice from him and his
family.  We'll solve our problems ourselves. Mama, if you have issues with
Shahzar's offer, then accept mine. Look, if you sell the jewelry or
take it back, you'll get some savings. Rameen, we don't need your car
or your jewelry. But I am returning both of these things
to you. Now it's up to you if you want to use it
or sell it off. Are you mad?  Are we going to take back
your dowry? And the situation isn't so bad. Your Baba has gone to find a job,
he'll get it, God is willing. Please don't tell me about him.
I'm very upset with him. Why are you upset? What has happened to you, Rameen? Who has filled your head with so
much poison against your father? You weren't like this. Honestly, Mama, I don't underestimate what
kind of magic Baba has done on you. I mean, you find some good
in everything he does, even bad things. He has brought you on the road.
Everything is over!  -You're still taking his side!
-Shut up, Rameen! You listen to me carefully. If you ever said anything against
your father, forget about meeting you, I wo
n't even talk to you. do you understand? Mam-- I just returned from Germany
a few days back. I've started a joint-venture with
a German company back there. Trust me, when I heard
about your situation, I cancelled all the meetings
and came running. Let me know if there's anything I can do
for you. Both of you have come to our home,
this is more than enough for us. He was so worried all the way here.
He was really worried about you. In fact, he was saying we should
take you to Islamabad with us. Yes. what's left here anymore?
Everything is ruined. Besides, we have a huge business. We'll also take advantage
of Umar's abilities. I anyway need a marketing manager
for a new project. That... thank you so much, but the issue is,
we... we can't move to Islamabad. Yes, Umar is absolutely right. Rameen is married here in Karachi.
She is our only daughter. How can we leave this city? You've married Rameen
in a well-off family, right? Or did she also fall in love with
a middle-class man like you did? Rameen has married
in a very good family. Being wealthy is indeed their plus point, but we don't form relationships
based on status or wealth. Oh, Auntie, you've taken offense.
Shehryar didn't mean anything by it. I came here to do my duty
because we're family. If you dislike my offer so much,
then I'll take my leave. No, no.  Why are you getting upset? What we mean to say is... Umar is very highly qualified.
He'll find a job in Karachi, God willing. Excuse me.  I'll go and check
who's at the door. How can you do this? We still have a few months left
before the deadline the bank gave us. We've been ordered by the bank
to have you vacate the house, sir. Here are the official documents.
It's the notice. We'll also have to take both your cars
into our possession. We're taking the cars today. But you only have 10 days
to vacate the house. But I'm telling you, I'll personally
bring the cars in a day or two. I'm so sorry, sir.
We have strict orders from the bank. We can't do this. I'll be right back. Omar? Why are you arguing?  Give them the keys. All right. I'll bring the keys. This one is very beautiful, Mom. Everything is just so perfect. You still haven't seen
your reception outfit. It is beautiful! You were at your parents' place
that's why I couldn't take you, otherwise you should've chosen it. No.  I completely trust your choice. You've selected it.
I'm sure it'll be beautiful. Not just beautiful, very beautiful. Mom has had the most expensive designer
of Pakistan design your dress. It's not a small event.
It's my daughter-in-law's walima outfit! It's not a trivial matter. I want you to look so beautiful that
everyone admires Shahzar's choice. That he has chosen
such a beautiful life partner. Thank you so much for everything, Mom. thank you for what? I think it was my misunderstanding
that I was unable to understand you. Shahzar always praises you so much. Now I know why he respects you so much. I just want the two of you to be happy.
I just want that. And listen, you... don't worry about your parents.
Once this reception is done, then we'll sit together and find
a solution for this problem, and... I'll do whatever I can for them. You don't worry. This means a lot.  Thank you.
Thank you so much. You ruined your entire life
for a stranger. You ruined everything
but you still didn't learn anything? Shehryar, please. You both are in my home right now, and I won't hear a single word against
my husband. You always did whatever you wanted,
and we remained quiet. We never interfered
in your personal matters. You gave your entire property
to Umar after Chacha Jaan's death? How did you trust him so blindly? what are you trying to say? That our financial bankruptcy
is because of Umar? Because of his mistake or negligence? No, no, no. You are in this condition today
because of his cunning nature. Why do you trust him so much anyway? Because he is my husband. If I don't trust him,
then who will I trust? You can't trust someone
just because he's your husband. He has to be a good person too. And we're sad that you didn't choose
a good life partner for yourself. But, Bhabi, I consider myself very lucky. I can't find a better life partner
than Umar. When I was diagnosed with blood cancer, and Shehryar returned the engagement ring
to my father, it was Umar who took my hand, took care of
me, and looked after my father's business. Did we say that you handed over the entire
business to Umar and sat at home? Did you see my condition back then? what do you think?  should I have taken care
of the business then? What did I know about handling
a business? My father trusted Omar. I married Umar because my father said so. And I am very happy with my decision. You don't look happy at all. Have you seen your face? Remember how you were before?  Look at
yourself now?  You've completely withered. This is what happens with blood cancer. How do you think I should look? I've been battling this disease
for years. Umar has spent all the money earned
from the business on my treatment. By taking me to Europe. Fine, I believe half of the property
was used in your treatment. What about the rest of Chacha
Jaan's property?  Where did it go? Mehru, tell me.  Where is that property? If you've come here to talk about
these things then please leave. I don't want to hear anything else. Are you going to humiliate and throw
us out of the house for that cheater? I've always heard that love is blind. Today I saw it too. I think Umar Bhai has
worked some magic on her; she wouldn't be supporting him like
this after everything that has happened. If I had a husband like that,
I would've sent him straight to jail. Let's go, Shehryar.  I won't tolerate
any more humiliation. Don't come home again. Just think that Mehr-un-Nisa is dead. When my own daughter doesn't trust me,
how can I be upset at strangers? Forget about Ramen. I'll set her straight. She won't ever dare to
disrespect you again.  Let her come. You've finally gotten better,
thank God, and you're getting so angry! I'm angry at Shehryar. Still.  You shouldn't have insulted them. He's your cousin.  He is older than you. What does it matter
even if he said something? He's cousin, he's my family.
Is that how the family is? You know this really well. After Abbu's death, they never even bothered
to check on us. It was us who used to go and meet them. If we're in this crisis today... we weren't begging them.  They could've said
two kind words to us.  That's it. They just taunted us and left. How many people are you going
to leave? They are your relatives. People are going to talk when they meet us. Such relatives can go to hell
who can't respect my husband. They're not welcome in my house. They didn't come here
because they cared. They came to see the spectacle.
They feel happy seeing us like this. I won't let them enter my house. Abbu... was right to object to my
and Shehryar's wedding. Now I understand why. I think he made the wrong decision. If he agreed to that wedding, today, you
would've been the wife of The Shehryar... the big businessman.  To install Millionaire. And me? You married a middle class man. Omar, don't say that please. I'm right though. I mean, look.  It took my whole life
to make my wife and daughter happy. To give them everything, but... What can I do though?  I couldn't do anything. I love you and you make me very happy. Really, I'm very happy. Just because you're going through a crisis, doesn't mean you start
considering your life partner unlucky We'll gather courage and handle
everything, face it all. Rameen. -Yes, Auntie?  -Look
at this.  I was going to the office. I thought I'd give you this set
to wear at the reception. Oh! This is a diamond set,
Shahnawaz got it made for me specially. Auntie, I already have so much jewellery.
I'll wear something from it. This is very expensive. No, no.  Everything I have is yours
and Minal's. And, yes!  The city situation is bad. After the reception, give me all
of your jewellery to keep in the safe. No, definitely.  I will gather everything
and give it to you. First thing in the morning.  Thank you.
Thank you so much. Omar. Why did you bring the water? I would've gotten it myself.
You're not feeling well anyway. Yes, I just remembered. The property dealer
has shown me some properties. You should take a look at it in the evening
too.  We'll confirm the one you like. I don't need to take a look at it.
Select whichever one you want. I think we should shift after Rameen
and Shahzar's reception though. Speaking of reception,
what are we giving them? We've already given them so much,
touch wood. What's the need to give more gifts?
And besides, it's not their anniversary or a birthday.
It's the walima reception.  -We'll still have to give something.
- Do you think so? So... I have some savings.  I'll do something. No one will be worse than me if you
go to tomorrow's function empty-handed. That's fine but what is this? These are my savings. Now you and your daughter
have the right to these. No, Ammi Ji... You keep it with you.  Wear it yourself.
I will manage something. There's no need. If it's not needed now
then when will it be needed? Select something for yourself. And take something for Rameen. Yeah!  In fact, I have two gold bracelets.
It's an old design. Let's go to the jeweler and get it remade
into the latest design. Rameen will be happy and she will
gain respect at her in-laws too. Thank you so much, Ammi Ji. Whatever I have, it's for you. what are you thinking, dear?
It's good, right? Everything's fine.
