[19.27] Baba!
[25.30] I think I should call and
inquire about his health.
[28.14] Then I have to invite them for the walima
as well.
[30.92] That won't be needed.
I've cancelled the walima function.
[40.44] Forgive me!
[41.88] I can't do all of this.
Especially not anymore.
[45.28] what's the drama?  Huh?
[47.80] -Why can't you do this?  Why?
-What can't I do?
[52.38] What can't I do it?  Wow, very good!
[55.60] Let me remind you if you've forgotten.
[58.18] Not much has happened,
Shahzar has just gotten married.
[60.85] He turned the woman he loved
into his wife and brought her home!
[63.91] And in this entire situation,
you expect me to go after him.
[68.55] No, I can't do all of this.
[70.71] The person who couldn't be
mine before, how will he be now?
[74.88] Had I known you were calling me for this, I
swear to God I wouldn't have come.
[81.31] I left everything and came here.
I had such a good job!
[84.92] Which job?
[86.48] That third-class receptionist job?
[89.18] You are forgetting that I gave you 2 lakh rupees
when you came here.
[94.14] 2 lakh rupees?  Stop talking right now,
I am telling you.
[98.04] Have you forgotten the spy work
you had me do for those 2 lakh rupees,
[103.27] - or should I remind you?
-Enough!
[106.02] There's no need to blackmail us.  Do you
understand?
[110.10] Has my foot become my tutor now?
Stay within your limits!
[114.81] - Ungrateful!
- Really?  What have I--
[117.95] Enough!  There's no need
for pointless arguments.
[120.53] I didn't call you here to impress Shahzar.
[123.56] Because you couldn't do it before,
and you are incapable of doing it at all.
[127.73] All you need to do is sow discord
between Rameen and Shahzar.  -It
[134.55] 's not an easy thing to do.  -It
's not impossible either.
[137.23] Just do as I say.
I will change your life in a few months.
[148.51] what are you going to do
for me?
[152.37] I'll let you know.
[154.05] First just listen to what you have to do.
[168.22] You're not going to worry
about anything now.
[171.98] We'll fix everything.
[174.77] How are things going to get fixed
on their own?
[179.36] Those two projects...
[181.74] the ones I was relying on...
[184.78] the one I hoped would make
everything fall into place...
[189.31] we lost them too.
[193.83] Why is all this happening?
[196.23] So what if we lost the projects?
We'll get more.
[201.28] You just can't lose hope.
[204.51] How can I not lose hope?
[209.19] All of this is happening to us and we...
[212.60] we don't even know why.
[215.35] Omar...
[218.05] listen to me carefully.
[223.25] Our business isn't more important
than your health.
[226.38] You always say this to me, right?
[228.72] There's no need to go to the office
until you've recovered.
[232.34] I already called your manager and told him
[235.22] You won't go to the office
until you're recovered,
[238.22] and he won't bring up any
issues with you.  Is everything right?
[244.65] What is he going to discuss with me anyway?
[247.84] He knows everything.
[250.97] And I also know what is about to happen.
[255.20] What's about to happen, Omar?
[259.45] For Rameen's wedding, I borrowed 50 lakhs
from a friend.
[267.42] And I thought that...
[270.22] I'll save the Lahore flat and...
[273.88] once the bank approves my loan,
I'll pay him back.
[280.76] But the bank has declined
to lend us any more money.
[286.14] Employees haven't been their salaries
for the last two months.
[290.14] They will all resign if they're
not paid within another week.
[294.77] I guess I'll have to sell
the Lahore flat now.
[298.33] But if the bank...
[301.73] pressures us to repay the loan...
[306.42] then maybe this house...
[308.95] the one you've already written
in Rameen's name, this also...
[312.38] will have to be pledged.
[315.56] No, Omar.
[318.58] We can't do this.
[322.03] We'll have to find another way.
[326.21] If this house is sold...
[329.73] we will be on the streets.
Where will we live?
[333.71] Either in a rented house or... a
[339.34] Rented house?
[344.64] Mehru, I'm tired, man.
[348.06] I can't do it.
[352.98] I am tired a lot.  I tried as much
as I could.
[357.68] To save this business of yours.
I worked day and night tirelessly...
[363.74] but I'm sorry.
[366.86] I couldn't save it.
[372.26] Omar, you can't lose courage.
[375.84] Umar, I...
[378.70] I ruined everything.  There's nothing left.
[397.23] Do you trust me?
[403.93] We will fix this.
[406.60] We'll fix everything.
[419.63] All right.
[420.99] You told me and I listened.
[423.75] But tell me, what will you
offer me in return for all of this?
[429.77] I was waiting for you to ask that.
[431.87] There's a great job opening at the office.
You'll work there.
[436.79] You'll get a good commission for
all the personal tasks you do for me.
[441.36] But I'll have to move here for that.
[445.54] Yeah, that's good.  Pack up your things
and move here.
[450.72] I've also brought all of my things here.
[453.12] If you come as well, it'll
feel more like my home.
[457.87] Amma, what are you saying?  You
said you'll go back to Hyderabad next week.
[462.87] To tell you the truth,
I don't like that city anymore.
[467.14] Since your brother and sister-in-law
left for Dubai, I feel uneasy there now.
[475.29] You know Shahnawaz doesn't like
you staying here.
[478.84] - Then why are you doing this?
-What is his issue?
[484.97] Okay, talk softly.
Talk softly, someone is going to listen.
[487.74] They can listen to whatever they want.
I am not scared of him.
[493.90] My daughter handles his home,
his business, everything!
[498.95] That grumpy old man, a widower.
[502.19] I have entrusted him with my young,
beautiful daughter.
[506.99] He wasn't worthy of a beautiful wife
like you.
[510.55] He is also 25 years older than you!
[514.52] And he's not very handsome either.
[517.08] On top of that, he broke both his legs
in an accident and is now bedridden.
[520.45] A [ __ ]!
[523.23] I have entrusted him
with a piece of my heart!
[527.58] He didn't value you at all.
[530.01] He should've worshipped the ground
you walk on.
[532.97] He hasn't given a single penny or a
single dime of his property in your name.
[537.72] -Enough!  Stop it.
-Let it be!
[540.58] This is whole drama!
[542.91] That's right.  You are absolutely right.  Are
[602.36] you still upset?
[606.55] Yes.
[609.17] Please forgive me, man.
[614.64] It's not about forgiveness.
[620.28] It's about yesterday night.
[624.20] That has already passed.
[630.18] You have no idea about the plans I had.
[636.04] I'll come to the room...
[639.90] I'll see you in your bridal dress...
[644.72] I'll tell you what's in my heart.
[653.39] Last night was the first night
of our new life.
[659.29] And you...
[663.33] Anyways...
[670.42] This... I
[673.71] got this for your mu-dekhai.
(the first look ceremony)
[685.50] I had planned to put it on
you with my own hands, but...
[692.33] anyway, take it.
[694.93] -Put it on yourself, Shahzar.  -Put
it on myself?  Are you serious?
[700.62] That time has passed,
that opportunity is gone.
[704.45] You just wear it yourself.
[707.76] - Okay.  Are you sure?
- Absolutely!
[710.68] Positive?  -Yes
[712.53] .
- Okay.
[715.68] I took this bracelet...
[718.35] it goes on my wrist,
[720.70] - and we--
- Okay, one minute.  what's wrong with you?  Do
[729.32] you know what's the worst
and the best about you?
[743.28] You know me better than anyone else
in the entire world.
[749.50] You too.
[751.10] You know, you're a little cute as well.
[754.69] It's beautiful though.
[756.86] Thank you.
[759.11] You're welcome.
[766.39] There's a meeting at 10 o'clock
with Mr.  Salman.
[769.39] Take the meeting points from my secretary.
[771.76] And I won't be able to join, I
have to go somewhere else.
[775.17] I'll come later.
[776.49] Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
I'll manage.
[779.47] And yes, I forgot to tell you something.
[781.85] You'll have to stay till late
at the office.
[784.54] I know you're newly married, but
the project is new, as you know.
[788.42] Your presence is very important.
[791.00] Come on, at least ask Rameen.
[793.25] What if she minds that her husband is
going to work the day after the wedding?
[796.73] -No, I understand.
-Yes, she understands.
[800.62] Rameen has her own family business.
[802.64] She knows really well what needs to be done
to run a business.
[806.05] By the way, Rameen,
you don't have to worry at all.
[809.15] I am also joining his office
in the next 2-3 days.
[811.94] Then Khala and I will handle everything.
And then he'll be free.
[816.07] -You are joining the office?
-What?  Really?
[819.10] That's a surprise for me.
[820.73] - When are you joining?  Who told you?
- I did.
[824.07] There is a vacancy in the sales department.
[825.95] I thought let me give her a chance and see
if she's worth it or not.
[829.67] This is a great idea!  We'll have fun
at the office now.
[835.16] But I'm getting late, so I gotta go.
So I'll see you at the office.
[838.88] -Bye!  Bye, bye.
- I am coming.
[841.53] -Goodbye!
-Goodbye!
[844.64] You should see off your husband
when he leaves.
[848.85] Didn't your mother teach you any manners?
[854.63] Be careful from now on.
[863.19] Make tea for me.
[866.00] I didn't tell you, I told Rameen.
[881.09] This is so pretty.  Did Bhai give you this?
[885.37] Very nice.
[887.50] Did he give it to you for your mu-dikahi?
[890.78] God, Khala!  Look at this, it's so pretty.
[896.48] Ask Shahzar where he got it from.
I want one exactly like this.
[902.22] You can keep it if you like it.
I'll get Rameen a new one.
[914.71] No, no, Khala.  I don't like it so much
that I'll take her mu dikhai's gift.
[921.97] I'm sure she won't mind.
[924.24] Besides, you're Shahzar's cousin.
[927.10] You're her sister-in-law according to
that relationship, this is your right.
[930.88] Rameen, give this bracelet to her,
I'll get you a new one.  ok?
[953.00] It's very nice.  Well, look.
[956.24] I'll have to say it.  Shahzar's choice
is amazing!
[961.60] Shahzar's choice is really amazing.
[964.74] He usually doesn't like ordinary things.
[967.73] He was a bit hasty in regards
to his marriage.
[971.91] Otherwise he had multiple very good girls
to choose from.
[989.79] She has a lot of attitude.
[993.40] Yeah, I see it too.
[997.69] But, Khala, it has so many diamonds.
It must be really expensive.
[1003.05] It is a very beautiful bracelet.
[1005.63] -What is this, Mom?  what did you do?
-What did I do?
[1010.06] The bracelet Bhai gave as a gift to Rameen,
you gave it to Maria?
[1013.26] She gave it herself.
[1015.04] Didn't you see how off Rameen's mood got?  Are
[1017.76] you really worried about your bhabhi?
[1019.81] Yes, I care.  Maria, go
and give this bracelet to Rameen.
[1023.96] What is your problem?  When did you
get so crazy about pitying someone?
[1027.01] It's not about pity, Mom.  I don't
understand why you're being so rude.
[1031.17] Bhai will react very badly if he found
out you gave the bracelet to Maria.
[1035.98] It is none of your business!
[1037.02] This is my business!  what's wrong with you?
[1039.08] You love Bhai a lot but with Bhabi,
you act like a typical mother-in-law!
[1042.60] You're arguing with me because of her?
[1045.27] -Mom, all I'm saying to you--
- Stop it!
[1048.56] Don't try to interfere in my matters,
understand?
[1058.63] Such a drama.
[1060.44] She is always angry like her father.
[1063.23] Thank God Shahzar doesn't like his father.
[1065.30] Otherwise it would've been very difficult
for me to handle him.
[1067.76] Oh, what can I say about Shahzar?
[1070.12] I've never seen an obedient son like him.
You've raised him so well.
[1075.34] He was very young
when I got married in this house.
[1078.25] I've raised him like a real mother would.
[1080.55] This is why he loves you so much.
[1083.64] Oh, I had to stop Shahzar from going to
that meeting.
[1086.75] I'll see what I have to do.
[1101.57] Salam, Mom.
[1103.26] Mom, I'm about to reach Mr.  Salman.
When will you get here?
[1108.12] Shahzar, the meeting has been postponed
so you just go to the office.
[1113.19] - Okay, great.
-Yes, I'll just come there.  Is everything right?
[1116.39] - Okay.
- Okay.
[1139.42] Fulfill our demands!  Fulfill our demands!
Fulfill our demands!  Fulfill our demands!
[1143.30] Fulfill our demands!  Fulfill our demands!
Fulfill our demands!  Fulfill our demands!
[1193.61] Here, I'm taking this bracelet.
Now it's onto my wrist...
[1199.11] - And now--
- One minute!
[1208.82] You got it for your mu-dikhai?
[1212.06] God, Khala!  Look, it's so beautiful!
[1219.21] Rameen, give this bracelet to her,
I'll get you a new one made.  ok?
[1229.45] It's very nice.  Well, look!
[1232.67] I'll have to say.  Shahzar's choice
is amazing!
[1245.52] Shahzar's choice is really very good.
[1248.60] He doesn't like ordinary things usually.
[1251.60] He was a bit hasty in regards
to his marriage.
[1255.81] Otherwise he had multiple very good girls
to choose from.
[1273.01] Shall we go, Khala?  I'm ready!
[1275.02] Oh, are you going to the office, or...
[1280.94] Khala, you know I like modern clothes.
[1284.31] I look as if I belong to a different
era when I wear shalwar kameez.
[1287.70] It didn't make any difference though.
[1290.01] Listen to me.
[1291.22] It is better you talk in Urdu
than use this wrong English.
[1295.96] Dress decently from tomorrow.
Buy a few branded clothes.
[1301.85] I can't afford to buy branded clothes.
And with the salary you're offering me,
[1305.49] it would be a big deal if I could
even afford peanuts.
[1307.32] Talk softly!
[1309.91] I'll buy you the clothes.
[1311.25] But don't come in front of Shahzar
dressed like this.
[1314.91] He'll wonder which
pathetic family I belong to.
[1319.55] Come on, we're getting late.  Let's go!
[1327.75] Calm down, Maria.
[1329.82] Calm down
[1331.74] It's your first day at the office.
[1351.29] My daughter handles his home,
his business, everything!
[1356.39] That grumpy old man, a widower.
[1359.08] I have entrusted him with my young,
beautiful daughter.
[1363.65] He wasn't worthy of a beautiful wife
like you.
[1367.21] He is also 25 years older than you!
[1370.69] And he's not very handsome either.
[1373.20] On top of that, he broke both his legs
in an accident and is now bedridden.
[1377.19] A [ __ ]!
[1379.83] I have entrusted him
with a piece of my heart!
[1384.30] He didn't value you at all.
[1386.63] He should've worshipped the ground
you walk on.
[1390.30] Sir, dinner is served.
[1393.12] Send you to my room.
[1396.96] He's 25 years older than you...
My daughter looks after his home... business
[1399.56] and everything...
He's not very handsome either...
[1402.82] Grumpy old man... 
[1404.54] He got both of his legs broken...
Grumpy old man...
[1414.59] I understood!
[1416.44] I understood everything.
[1418.20] The bitterness between me and Tabinda...
[1421.51] the reason behind it is no one else but
her own mother.
[1425.65] She keeps provoking against me, keeps
feeding her nonsense and false accusations.
[1429.57] What happened, Shahnawaz?
Why are you so angry?
[1433.36] Aapa, I can't describe how many
rude remarks both of them were making.
[1439.12] I told you, Aapa,
[1441.38] that for God's sake, don't marry me into
this cheap, poor family, but you?
[1446.06] Let it be, Shahnawaz.
[1448.86] Your wife isn't so bad.
[1451.38] Yes, I agree that she's a little bitter.
[1454.16] There's no understanding between you two,
but look,
[1457.71] the way she handles your kids, your home, your
business,
[1463.51] no one can do that.
[1466.67] You should value her.
[1471.05] Value!
[1473.64] It's enough that I'm tolerating her.
[1477.76] God knows where they have come from.
Her mother and her...
[1482.08] illiterate niece.  Uncivilized.
[1484.93] She doesn't even know
how to dress properly!
[1486.91] What happened to you?
We have such a big house.
[1491.08] There are so many guest rooms here.  What's
your objection to 2 people staying here?
[1497.31] I have objections!
[1499.51] My daughter will live
with that illiterate person.
[1502.49] She is going to become like her too.
[1504.57] And I don't want my daughter
to become ignorant and arrogant like her.
[1509.54] Look, Shahnawaz.
[1511.80] You don't have to worry about Manal at all.
[1514.97] She knows what's good for her
and what's not.
[1518.00] And then she has been raised
under my watch.
[1521.14] You should be a little more gentle
in your attitude.
[1524.92] Otherwise, you'll become distant with
you kids too as you did with your wife.
[1529.07] Remember this.
[1535.28] Where's Mr.  Shahzar's office?
[1537.90] And you are?
[1539.97] Tell him Maria is here.
[1541.94] Ma'am, we're not allowed
to send anyone inside like this.
[1545.84] - And you--
- Miss.
[1547.76] I don't need introduction,
I told you that before.
[1550.84] It's my first day here.  I'm his cousin.
[1553.38] I've joined as his personal secretary.
[1558.72] There.  It's there.
[1562.43] Send coffee for both of us.
[1564.36] - Ma'am, listen to me.  -Right
away!
[1578.18] - Hi, Shahzar.
-Hi.
[1580.81] What's going on?
[1583.37] I'm so sorry.  I should refer to
you as "boss", but what can I do?
[1587.94] It will take me a little time
to understand the office atmosphere.
[1592.02] And you know this is my first job.
[1595.75] I had a plethora of jobs
one I completed my masters.
[1600.11] But then Khala told me
that you need a personal secretary.
[1605.99] I refused everyone and came here.
[1609.65] Per-- personal secretary?  For me?
[1613.02] I don't need a personal secretary.
I've just come here 2 months ago.
[1618.69] Khala has called me here,
she must have thought of something.
[1624.37] I think...
[1626.64] you didn't like me coming here.
[1628.45] No, no.  It's not like that.  It's just...
[1630.78] Actually, I was a bit surprised.
[1634.14] Mom told me you'll be in
the marketing department
[1637.83] as a marketing executive.
[1639.55] I don't understand this
whole personal secretary thing.
[1642.30] Yes, that's how it was.
[1644.19] But I clearly refused saying
that I want to work with Shahzar.
[1650.13] Close to him.
[1652.45] I mean, I'll learn something
if I work under you.
[1656.71] Show me what you're doing.
[1666.35] what's the password for this?
[1668.82] Oh, it's on.
[1672.80] Shahzar.
[1674.84] Call for coffee.
[1677.70] Yes.
[1684.43] This bracelet is exactly like the one
I gave Rameen.
[1691.11] She gifted it to me.
[1694.71] She's a wonderful girl.  We became
such good friends in such a short time.  did
[1698.27] you gift it to me?
[1701.76] Yes, she gave it to me in front of Khala.
[1704.08] You can call and ask her if you want.
[1705.82] I tried to refuse it many times, but
she just gave me such an expensive gift.
[1709.60] She said it's a little old fashioned.
I'll ask Shahzar to get me a new one.
[1714.20] She forcefully gave it to me.
[1719.79] Yes.
[1755.48] Hi, Mama.
[1757.85] How are you?  How are you Baba?
[1760.05] Rameen, sweetheart, he's perfectly fine,
but he misses you a lot.
[1768.07] My child, are you crying?
[1770.35] - Is everything okay?  -I
just miss you a lot.
[1774.27] Tell me, where is Shahzar?
[1778.10] He's still at the office.
[1780.39] What?
[1781.93] Shahzar went to the office today?
[1784.95] There was some important work.
[1788.37] Dear, what could be so important that he
left his new bride and went to the office?
[1794.98] Tabinda didn't stop him?
[1797.76] She's the one who sent him.
[1803.65] Mama, as decent and graceful she looks,
she's that cunning on the inside.
[1814.18] She manipulates the whole family,
specially Shahzar.
[1818.20] He doesn't even breathe
against her wishes.
[1855.17] Oh, Shahzar.  You are sitting here.
[1857.67] And you came back so late
from the office.  What happened?
[1861.29] I thought you'd come back right after
the meeting and give time to Rameen.
[1865.09] You're newly married!
You wasted the entire day at the office.
[1868.91] No, no.  I didn't waste it.
[1871.09] I had a very productive day.
[1872.95] In fact, I had a meeting with Mr.  Salman
too.  I sort out other things as well.
[1877.64] That's all well and good,
but there's your personal life too.
[1882.16] You are newly married.
Give me Rameen some time.
[1885.49] what must she think?
[1887.49] Besides, she seemed a little upset today.
[1889.94] She was a little rude at the
breakfast table, but it's not her fault.
[1894.39] Obviously, she must think I sent you
to the office the first day after your wedding.
[1899.90] Maybe it's my fault.
[1901.70] If she's upset, make it up to her.
Talk to her.
[1904.38] No, no.  Why are you saying that?
[1906.34] It's not like that at all.  Rameen is
an educated girl from a decent home.
[1909.71] She definitely doesn't think that,
and if she did, I'll talk to her.
[1914.23] Don't worry.
[1976.26] Mama, as decent and graceful as she looks,
she's that cunning inside.
[1980.82] She manipulates the entire family,
specially Shahzar.
[2014.60] I've told you this a million times.
[2016.88] I won't tolerate any of your family members
in this house.
[2021.61] You can help them financially
if you want.
[2024.42] You've always done that anyway.
[2027.30] But living in this house?  Sorry.
I will not allow that.
[2032.99] And your sister?  She lives here too.
I never objected to that.
[2036.90] I don't know what your problem is
with my niece and my mother.
[2040.60] My sister is a widow.
[2043.13] She has as much rights to this house
as me and my children do.
[2046.87] You cannot compare your mother
to my sister.
[2049.66] I'm not comparing them.
I've always respected her.
[2053.93] I've always considered her my mother-in-law
instead of my sister-in-law.
[2056.36] I never disrespected your mother either.
I've always respected her.
[2061.61] But in this house?  I can't do that.
And yes!
[2065.74] Keep your mother away from my daughter.
[2068.99] -That woman is worth--
- Enough, Shahnawaz.
[2071.80] I can't tolerate slander
in my mother's name anymore!
[2074.59] what will you do?
Will you complain to my son?
[2078.29] What else do you know and expect this?
[2080.18] All your life you've done nothing
except turn my son against me.
[2084.47] And that girl that you've brought on
our heads?  what is she doing here?
[2089.66] what does she need?  A job.  Give her a job.
Please send her away though.
[2108.75] Sir, in order to pay back the bank loan,
we'll have to wind up the business.
[2113.92] We don't have any other option, sir.
[2118.80] Sir, workers are making a lot of noise
about late payments.
[2122.17] Sir, it has been two days since the strike.
[2125.06] Sir, if we fired them all suddenly,
then the problem will become even bigger.
[2137.06] What has to happen tomorrow...
[2141.46] might as well do it today.
Why wait till tomorrow?
[2144.78] As per the law, sir, we will be
required to pay them six months' salary.
[2148.37] And how are we going to arrange
so much cash, sir?
[2152.76] You're already drowning in debts.
[2154.88] And the bank won't grant you
any more loans, sir.
[2158.62] That'll be arranged.
[2161.96] My apartment in Lahore is worth
around 3-3.5 crores.
[2167.35] Let's sell that.  It'll be arranged.
[2170.80] Sir, think about it.  You won't
have any properties left after this.
[2175.13] You'll be empty handed.  It
[2177.49] doesn't matter, man!
[2179.68] Being empty handed is better, but...
[2182.83] employees' dues must be cleared.
Whatever they're owed,
[2186.24] they should be paid that.
[2190.54] You do one thing.  Go to Lahore yourself.
[2194.55] There's an agent I spoke to.
He made a good offer.
[2197.88] I'll give you his number.
Go and talk to him, and...
[2201.91] put an end to this matter.
[2204.92] All right, sir, whatever you say.
[2207.47] - I will go to Lahore.
- Okay, you can go.
[2210.35] All right, sir.
