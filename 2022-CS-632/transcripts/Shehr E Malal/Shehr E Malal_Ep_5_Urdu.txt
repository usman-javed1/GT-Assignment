I could never have imagined that my father
could be this selfish and materialistic. Everyone has always told me
that he married you for money. Shut up, Rameen! Be quiet! Eat something Mama, why don’t you understand something? Why do you keep bringing food to my room? - How long will you stay hungry, child?
- I'll stay hungry as long as I can. You don’t need to worry. If I don’t worry about you,
then who will I worry about? If you stay hungry, do you think your
parents will be able to eat anything? What do you think of your parents? You think are we so heartless,
made of stone? Seeing you in this condition
is not something we enjoy. It's you who don't care about us. You don't even care about your sick mother. Don't you guys feel pity for me? What did I ask of you, Mama? I only wanted that I could marry
out of my own will. Someone that I love. You yourself love Baba, don’t you?
You know it! You know that when you love someone,
you can't imagine life without them. I’ve made Shahzar my life... And you want me to forget him, Mama? That's impossible! Umar! Listen to me. Listen, Umar! You can't leave like this. Wait!
Wait, I won’t let you go like this. If you have something to say,
say it quickly. I don't have time. Your mother came to me and said
you want to break off the engagement, and you want to break
it off on your own terms. You've heard it right. You used to say that you
couldn’t live without me! You used to make such bold statements that
you can't imagine your life without me. That you can't breathe. But now, you want
to end everything over something so small? Why? It’s not a small matter, Tabinda! Many differences have come between us. I can’t give you the luxurious life
you want. Even if I sacrifice my entire life, I still won't be able to give you
your desired life. Please don’t leave me like this. I swear, I’ll die without you. It’s too late now, Tabinda. You’ve wasted too much time
in understanding this. You're lying! You made your decision
based on wealth, not need. You’re rejecting me for money, aren’t you? - No, Tabinda, I--
- Don't touch me! Don’t even mention my name
with your filthy tongue. You’re the worst person in the world. I don’t even want to look at your face. I hate you very much!
I hate you very, very much! I’ll never forgive you.
I will never forgive you. There is no better way to punish a greedy,
deceitful, and unfaithful person than this. that you bring his daughter as your
daughter-in-law and make his life hell. And I bet he will come running to you, begging for his daughter’s
hand in marriage. He will plead with you. You know, when you love someone,
you can't imagine life without them. I’ve made Shahzar my life. Yes? I... I need to talk to you
about something important. This isn't a good time to call anyone. Yes, I'm sorry. Actually, I’ve been so worried
because of Rameen that I didn’t realize. How is she doing? Yes, good. Thank God! I know what it’s like to lose love.
Who better than me understands this? I... I want to meet you. Look, I know you... you're upset with me, in fact, you hate me. - But I--
- I don’t want to get into this debate. Whatever you have to say, come to
my office tomorrow morning and we’ll talk. Yes, all right. Now you're just being unfair, Mom!  You told me you would help,
but now you're backing out. I’m not backing out at all,
but you know your father. Rameen tried to commit suicide, and yet
his heart hasn’t softened. What can I say? You tell me then. Tell me what can I do
to convince him? Tell him that I'll leave the house. I already said it but it was of no use,
he didn't listen to me. Then you should fake a suicide attempt. Fake. Pretend you took some pills.
I’ll handle everything else, I’ll help. No, no, Mom. That's not possible.
You know he has a heart condition. God forbid if he has another attack… - What happened? What are you thinking?
- Nothing. Look, what I'm trying to say is
I can't risk his health, his life. I understand, of course. Then do this: forget about Rameen. You can either make your daddy happy
or you can marry Rameen. It's up to you. You know your dad. Fine, I’ll go with your first idea. - I’ll tell him I’m leaving the house.
- Try it, maybe it will work. I said no to Mr. Manzoor. Whatever you want... will happen. Baba, I'm really sorry. I'm extremely sorry, Baba. I don't need your apology. I don't want it. But I'll have one complaint
for the rest of my life. The rest of my life! A stranger became so important to you... that you didn't even think
about your sick mother. I know I've hurt you both a lot. I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry. What's done is done. From now on at least... before you make any move, please... think about your mother. She's fought a very lengthy battle. All alone. On her own. She can't bear any more shock. There’s no response
from Shahzar’s family yet. As soon as they respond... I'll fix your proposal and send you off. One more thing. since you’re marrying on your own terms... don’t come back to this house
with any complaints. You're my father. And I respect you a lot. Maybe it doesn’t seem that way, but... I also love you very much, Dad. But today... today I need your trust and support. I’ve always followed your advice. You said... don't pursue law... Get an MBA from the US. So I did that. You told me to join the business, not
to do my own thing, and I did that too. But now I’m a grown up, Dad. I’m an adult, and... I want to marry with my own choice. My religion allows me
to make this decision. If I wanted... I can go against your wishes... and get married
but I don't want to hurt you. That's why I request you, Dad. Please go to Rameen's house with Mom
and ask for her hand for me. Please, Dad. If I... don't do that, then? Shahzar, listen to me. Baba himself came to me and said
he has no problem with our marriage. Now it's up to you. please convince your parents quickly,
because if you delay, Baba will arrange my marriage
with someone else. his is great news, but give me some time.
I need to convince my parents, too. Your parents are not yet convinced? No, no, there’s no problem with Mom.
She’s agreed. The real issue is Dad. I’ve tried everything with Dad, but... he just won’t listen. But you don’t worry, I... I will convince him by any means.
Mom is with me. Give me some time, give me some trust.
Everything will be fine. A few days ago, you were against Shahzar
marrying in that family. and now you’re trying to convince me
to allow him to marry into that family. Tabinda, are you also against
this proposal? I didn’t have any objections; I simply mentioned to him that her
father doesn’t have the best reputation. Otherwise I liked Rameen at first sight. You know very well that my son
is my weak point. I won’t compromise on his marriage. Your excessive pampering has spoiled him. Now he's starting to argue with me,
he’s threatening to leave this house. Right now, it’s just threats. But I’m sure he will leave us. What will you do then? Please, don’t threaten to disinherit him. He’s educated, has a good foreign degree,
he won’t have any shortage of job offers. Once he leaves, he won’t come back. Shahzar became very upset after
hearing about that girl's suicide attempt. If he said he would leave the house, 
then he will definitely leave. No, he can’t do that. He can’t give me such
a big shock at this age. Look, Shahnawaz, if his happiness lies
in this, we should respect his happiness. Before he brings that girl into
this house after marrying her, we need to make a decision. Do you remember, 20 years ago,
when we went to a restaurant together when I got my first job?
I took you there to treat you. How can I forget that? And that day, you got so angry, 
you even threw your ring away. We searched for it for so long. I even apologized to you, but… you're you. Always so cold-hearted. Am I cold hearted or are you? Time has already proven that. I forgave you that day though. Maybe, but I don’t think
I truly did from the heart. That day, you broke a lot of dishes in
the restaurant, you caused such a scene. I didn’t even have enough money to
pay for the damages to the restaurant. It was so embarrassing. A person in love can do anything, but
you couldn’t bear a little embarrassment? Is that why you broke ties with me? I broke the tie, or did you? You couldn't bear my existence. My poverty, my circumstances, 
you couldn't bear that. I don't want to talk about this topic. Look, Tabinda, if we don’t talk, how will
we clear the misunderstanding between us? I didn't come here to talk about you and I. You mentioned something about Rameen. Well, I wanted to talk about that. Look, Tabinda, Shahzar and Rameen 
like each other. They love each other. But I’m afraid that in our fight, 
the children’ lives will be affected. I'm not the one against their marriage,
my husband is. What are his objections? He’s worried seeing 
your business’s deteriorating reputation. He thinks your motivation
for this marriage is money. You know me well. Do you also think
that I'd wed my daughter for money? You know me. And I know you as well. This should stay between us. All right. Your tea. I told you, didn’t I? Umar will definitely come to you to ask 
about his daughter’s proposal. It happened just like that. He was talking big—
"I'll do this, I'll do that". All his pride has been crushed to dust. Now, what you need to do is tell him to come with his wife
and ask for Rameen's proposal. What are you saying? 
How can this be possible? Why can’t it be? 
His daughter is dying for your son! No, Shahzar will not like this at all, 
and Umar Hassan will not agree either. This is a bit difficult. For the happiness of the children, 
he will even hold your feet. And this is the time to show him his
place and display your power and position. I don’t understand what you’re saying. 
How will this happen? What do you mean you don't get it?
Let me explain. I have convinced Shahnawaz for the
marriage. Now he will have no objections. All right. Rameen is your entrusted
responsibility in my hands now. You can take her whenever you want. By the way, when are you coming? We won’t come this time; you will. Oh, Shahnawaz agreed on the condition that you bring your daughter’s proposal 
and come to us. But how can this happen? In our culture... I mean... The girl's side doesn't take
the proposal to the boy's family! What difference does it make? I’ve already come to your house once. 
This time, you come. What difference does it make? But it doesn’t feel right. Why? Why doesn’t it feel right? 
What’s so strange about it? Let me remind you.
Do you remember that many years ago, my mother came to your mother’s house 
to beg for my proposal. And your mother insulted my mother
and threw her out of the house. But don’t worry, 
I won’t treat you the same way. You want revenge? Revenge? I would have taken revenge if
I had any grudge about not marrying you. By the grace of Allah, I am very
happy in my home and with my marriage. Anyway, I called to inform you 
about my husband’s decision. Now, it’s up to you whether you bring 
your daughter’s proposal or not. Let me know. Have a good day. Goodbye. What? Has this woman lost her mind? Have we ever heard that the girl’s side
goes to the boy’s family with a proposal? It’s not this woman who has lost her mind;
it’s our own darling daughter! We all have to bear the consequences to it. I’ve never bowed my head like this before. I'm here. I'll go and bring her 
to her senses! - Sit.
- What? - Sit down, listen to me carefully.    
- But, Umar, I-- Man, please listen to me. At this moment, trying to explain
anything to your daughter will be useless. She won’t understand anything. I just agreed to this marriage, 
and now if I back out, what if she takes another rash step? You’re right, but... I won’t tolerate seeing your head bow 
in front of anyone. Anyway, what’s wrong with our daughter?
Is there any shortage of proposals? Why do we have to beg for a proposal 
at their house? This is the condition they've agreed upon. They want to humiliate us. The marriage isn't even here yet, and
these are the conditions they're setting? What will they do to our daughter 
after the marriage? What are you people talking about? 
How is this possible? They are the girl’s family, 
they won’t make the first move. Mom, you do one thing: take Manal
and Phuppo to their house with you. What can I do? They are insisting
on coming. I can’t stop them. Aapa, what kind of people are they? They don't care about their self respect 
at all? Look, Shahnwaz,
every family has its own traditions. They may seem like very decent 
and respectable people. They not only seem decent  
and respectable, they are. Decent and respectable? If they were decent and
respectable, they wouldn’t be begging for a proposal for
their daughter at our doorstep like this. If they were truly decent, their daughter wouldn’t
have attempted suicide and humiliated her family's honor 
and respect like this. Dad, I don't want to argue 
with you right now. Look, they’re coming this evening. 
It wouldn’t be proper to stop them now. Mama? Where are you guys headed, all dressed up? We’re going to Shazar’s house to beg 
for your proposal from his parents. What? Listen. They should come here, 
why are you going there? Dear, it's better if you don't interfere 
in this matter. Your wish is being fulfilled. 
Isn’t that enough? Let's go, we have to be there at sharp 6. Baba, please listen to me. 
This isn't right. You're not going to go there!
This isn't right. We also wanted them to make the
first move, but it’s their insistence now. Do you understand now why your
father was against this marriage? But now we can’t do anything because your
scandal has spread throughout the city. Now, you have to marry Shahzar. This is the only way to erase your shame. Let's go? Oh, Ammi Ji? - Salam.
- Walikum Salam. Oh, how's my sweetheart? - Salam, Grandma.
- Oh! My sweetheart, my doll! - How is my princess?
- Very good! Such a pleasant surprise. You always surprise me. I thought I would
surprise everyone by coming suddenly. It's good that you came yourself, otherwise, we would've called you today 
to come. Why? Is there any special news? And... where are you guys off to? We are going to Rameen’s in-laws. What? You're marrying off Rameen 
and you're only telling me now? No, nothing has been decided yet. Can we do anything without your advice?
Actually, you should come with us. Why not? Of course,
I will go meet my son-in-law. But first, let me see my daughter.
Oh, she's blushing. How lovely she has become! How time flies! - Let's go, I’m definitely coming!  
- Come! Come, you sit in the front. - Ammi Ji, how is that possible?
- Okay, I'll sit in the front. - I’ll have the room ready for Grandma.  
- Yes, please. Please, son, get some cake or sweets 
from a good place. We'll get both things, if you say so. This is for our new project 
with Javed ans sons. This is the last one. Okay, all right. - Here?
- Here. That's it. They haven’t arrived yet. They'll come. You should have told them 
we’re not accustomed to waiting. They should have been here
at the given time. They don't value time. - I think they're here. I'll go and check.
- No, you won't go. Send a servant to tell them to sit in
the drawing room and serve them tea. We’ll go together later. Okay. If your parents come to my house first,
what’s the fault of mine or my parents? Shahzar, why don’t you understand? This is all happening because of your dad. Your mom called my dad to come
to your house with my proposal. Wrong. That’s absolutely wrong. My dad didn’t say that. 
Why would he say that? Because they're feeling insecure. He wanted to show they're you're above us 
in status. Look, I've spoken to my mom
in much detail about this. And whatever she said was right,
Dad didn't say anything like that. In fact, your dad said that he wanted
to come to our house. Maybe he was trying to confirm our status. Maybe he wanted to ensure they weren't marrying their daughter 
into a lower-status family. That they're marrying you
into such a grand home. I am very disappointed 
to hear you say that. My parents have no interest in your wealth. They’ve seen plenty of wealth 
in their lives. Rameen. Rameen, listen to me.
Hello! Hello? Allow me to introduce myself;
I'm Shahzar's phuppo. And you must know her, 
this is our darling Manal. Salam! - Salam! 
- Salam! So sorry for being a little late. Not just a little, 
you people were almost an hour late. We’re just a little particular about
discipline. Please be careful next time. It's all right, it happens. Please sit.
Sit. Call Shahzar. You know how today’s generation. They choose their life partner first 
and then tells their parents. And what is the role of the parents? Just
bow their heads to everything they say. - Please, take something.  
- No, thank you. Oh, please. Auntie, you? - Should I make you a cup of tea?
- No, thank you. It would have been good if Shahzar
had come. We could have met. Yes, I've called Shahzar. "Please enjoy the tea first, then
we can talk about other things. And I'll also bring out the sweets then,
God willing. Instead of wasting time on pleasantries, 
why don’t we set the wedding date? The wedding will be grand, but if the engagement could take place
in a week, what do you think? We can't decide everything in one meeting,
right? We need some time to think. Umar, I think we should leave. Okay. As you wish. Thank you. Nice meeting you. Thank you. Are you out of your mind? 
Do you know who this woman is? Yes, I know. Despite knowing everything, you
want to send your daughter to that hell? She’s a vulgar, greedy, 
and manipulative woman! And her mother? 
She is the factory of evil deeds. Your daughter won’t get a moment 
of peace in that house. She will take revenge on her 
for everything! Amma, you know what? I've felt that... Tabinda has changed. She's not the same person. 
There’s more calmness in her. And the other thing is, Amma... our daughter, our darling, she... she's involved with her son. She likes him. In fact, she has even attempted suicide 
for him. What? Why didn’t you tell me all this earlier? How could I, Amma? How can a father face anyone after his
daughter has tried to take her own life? Are they in a position
to tell anyone anything? Look, Amma, I feel very helpless. She's my only daughter. I’ve loved her so much. 
I can’t see her dying little by little. Suffocating. On the other hand, there's my ill wife. Don't know how many days... how many days she has left. She wants to see her daughter's happiness
before she dies. - But, son...
- That's it, Amma. Let me make the decision I'm making. I don't have any other option. Amma, we have Allah. Allah is the One who is capable of
everything. He is the master of all things. I have hope in Allah that He will keep
my daughter safe from harm in that house. I have given my consent. I've told them that whenever they
want, they can come and put on the ring, perform the engagement ceremony,
and take any wedding date they prefer. I'm helpless, Amma. Please understand.
