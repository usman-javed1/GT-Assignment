[36.68] Look, try to understand.
This is a huge business.
[40.29] And I'm one who has to
look after the factories now.
[42.50] Dad's been on the wheelchair
for the last 20 years.
[45.28] And mom has handled this business
in his place.
[48.41] But now it's time for me
to fulfill my responsibilities.
[52.49] Shahzar, I don't have a problem with you
going to the office.
[56.45] I'm only saying that you went
on the second day of the wedding.
[59.59] That's what I'm saying.
Why don't you understand?
[63.10] I had a very important meeting
otherwise I wouldn't have gone.
[66.04] Anyway, forget about it.
[67.45] Stop being angry and let's go outside
with me.
[70.21] Everyone is waiting for us at the breakfast.
[73.87] We'll have breakfast.
[75.60] But before that, there are a few
important thing I have to discuss with you.
[78.79] I have some grievances with you,
some complaints.
[81.81] I have a lot of grievances
with you too.
[84.00] I was also very upset but did you try
to make it up to me?  No, not even once.
[88.22] Did you even try to listen to me once?
Try to understand me?
[91.35] -What grievances?  What have I done?
-Man, forget about it!
[94.97] If I started talking,
it'll take the whole day.
[97.01] No, no, no.  You tell me.
[99.04] Let me see what your mom has said
to provoke you against me.
[106.20] what did you say?  Do
[109.16] you think my mom provokes me
against you?
[112.57] I don't think she does, I know!
[117.04] I have figured out her reality
in just two days!
[120.33] I can't believe it.
[122.65] I can't believe how wrong I was
and how right Dad was!
[126.95] Dad was right about you,
and about your family background.
[132.98] You know what, Rameen?
[135.52] You don't deserve me.
[159.06] Nano has cancer, and... -
[161.34] Why didn't you tell me about it?
-She told me not to.
[165.53] She doesn't want to become a burden
on anyone.
[168.82] And please, don't tell your dad.
[171.06] Otherwise he'll think that I'm wasting
his money on Nano's treatment.
[174.72] Dad can think whatever he wants.
[177.99] I don't care about that.
[180.42] As for nano's treatment,
you don't worry about that.
[185.09] I'll bear all the expenses
of Nano's treatment myself.
[188.49] In fact, if we had to take her abroad,
I will.
[192.13] No, no.
[193.72] That's not the real issue.
[196.12] What I'm really worried about is...
[198.64] how do I tell Nano to leave the house?
[204.31] Why would she leave the house?
Why would you say that to her?
[207.55] She has lived with us her whole life,
why would she go now?
[210.70] Look, Dad can think whatever he wants.
[213.92] All the expenses of her treatment
will come from my account,
[216.44] so dad should have any problems either.
[218.93] Whenever you need the money,
please let me know.
[224.50] Sir, you didn't do right by us.
Specially with me.
[229.76] I had such great offers but I came here
because you called me.
[235.35] Look, I know you weren't treated fairly,
but...
[238.99] but the company also has some constraints.
[241.30] Sir, you remember your problems!
We're poor people too, Mr.  Omar!
[246.31] Look, you...
[248.71] You're an intelligent, sensible man.
You're honest.  You'll find a job anywhere!
[253.49] I know that really well!
[254.97] But the time I've wasted by coming here,
I'll make sure you pay for it!
[260.12] As per the contract,
I am entitled to a salary for the 6 months.
[263.97] - I won't leave it on any condition!
-Guard!
[265.73] -I don't think I'll spare you.  -Take
him away!
[267.29] Fine, go away from here.
[268.33] I'll be after you until the very end
and take all that I'm due!
[277.30] Why'd you sell a flat worth 4 crores
for 2 crores?
[285.15] Mehru, nobody was offering more than that.
[289.97] I had no option to save the flat
and sell something else.
[296.43] I needed the money immediately.
[298.63] That's why I had to make this decision.
[302.70] No, you're right.
[306.21] Don't you think that if we had waited
a bit longer,
[309.21] we might have received a better offer?
[313.29] You are right.
[315.88] But we were unable to wait.
[318.96] The company employees
are going to the court.
[322.80] If they had gone to court, we would have had to
go through the courts,
[325.92] and they would have dragged
us into the courtroom.
[331.76] Otherwise I would have to beg another friend
of mine so that I could get more loan.
[337.92] I don't think that was appropriate.
[341.68] The building's rent for 6 months and...
[347.26] and the clients' dues...
[350.09] I still have to arrange more funds.
[356.47] Karachi didn't suit us.
[360.84] I don't know who cursed us...
[364.59] Our business was doing so well,
everything was working out.
[369.55] This is a wretched city.
[377.88] Don't tell Rameen anything and
don't discuss it at her in-laws' either.
[383.47] She is a very sensitive girl.
[386.74] She'll get upset and worried.
[390.66] I don't want it.  She is newly married...
[394.10] let the two of them be happy.
[396.12] We'll see everything later.
[408.12] God!  I got so worried when Shahzar
spoke of her cancer!
[412.69] Oh, thank God I'm perfectly fine.
[415.78] Your Khala had all the plans to kill me
in motion.
[420.24] No, Amma, it's not like that.
I hope you live even my years.
[423.13] I only lied to soften Shahzar's heart.
[426.88] And they say if you lie for a purpose,
it's not really a lie.
[429.69] I mean, something that doesn't harm anyone.
[431.65] Yeah, you're right, Khala.
[433.34] And besides, what difference is her cancer
going to make to anyone?
[435.77] I think you should go to your room
and prepare for the assignment.
[439.04] Amma, she insulted me in front of Shahzar
today.
[441.81] She said she doesn't know anything
about computers.
[444.13] Do a few courses!
[445.47] She's busy on Facebook the whole day.
[447.75] yeah?  And then he says she doesn't know how to
work the computer.
[450.46] Khala, you called me here
to spy on Shahzar.
[454.12] You have a lot of other people
to work on the computers.
[456.85] I can't do all of that.
[459.13] Really?  Then how are you going
to spy on him?
[462.16] I've hired you as his personal secretary.
[464.46] If you'll stay around him, do his work,
then you'll know what he's up to.
[467.21] Okay then.  I'll charge extra for this.
[471.30] Look, you're paying me the monthly salary,
[473.52] but there'll be extra commission
for these extra things.
[475.64] Stop it, greedy woman!
[478.22] Amma, I think we should send her back.
Back to Hyderabad.  She was fine there.
[481.77] Oh, no, no.  She'll learn.
She's still a girl.
[518.90] Are you still upset with me?
[524.26] Look, if we kept fighting
each other like this, then... -
[527.96] this car won't run smoothly.  -Which
car?
[534.71] Mom told me that a husband and wife
are like 2 wheels of the same car.
[541.45] If one doesn't work,
everything falls apart.
[545.83] Shahzar.
[549.33] Please don't give examples
of your mom.
[553.02] In the last few days, I've realized
the importance of your dad in this house.
[558.50] -What do you mean by this?
-You know exactly what I mean.
[562.40] The fights and the bitterness between your
parents, even the servants are aware of it.  So
[567.74] please.
[569.26] Don't give me the examples of their love
and understanding.
[573.39] Rameen.
[577.87] Man, I was giving you their example.
[581.47] I'm only sharing her point of view
that she shared with me.
[584.98] And yes, you're right.
[586.80] My parents do have a lot
of misunderstandings.
[590.04] But did you ever ask me the reason
behind it?
[593.71] After Dad's accident,
he started feeling complex.
[597.45] He used to argue with Mom on everything,
[599.38] and maybe that's why
he acts the same with you.
[601.88] No.
[603.80] Uncle's behavior with me is perfectly fine, I
have no issues with him.
[607.28] -Then what is it?
-Shahzar, please try to understand.
[611.96] Sometimes Auntie's behavior with me
gets really weird.
[616.88] Look, she's not what she appears to be--
[619.02] I don't want to argue about
this any further, Rameen.
[626.55] Why are you so against my mother?
[629.87] Why should I have to explain
to you how wonderful she is
[633.76] and everything she's done for this house?
[636.46] I understand that for you she is merely
your mother-in-law.
[641.21] But to me, she's everything.
[646.13] Listen.
[648.12] Shahzar, I'm sorry.
[651.23] Look, I didn't want to hurt you.
[654.47] I was only trying to tell you the reality.
[657.98] And not just this,
there's so much I want to say to you.  -But
[661.32] please fix your mood.  -All
right.
[664.57] Just... just forget about it.
[667.94] I also wanted that...
[671.38] everything gets normal, but...
[674.40] Get ready and come.
I am waiting for you in the car.
[690.16] She's getting a bit too out of hands.
I'll have to subdue Maria.
[696.61] She so blatantly told me that she was
going to charge for everything separately.
[702.25] Don't give her a single penny.
[704.33] And the diamond bracelet you've given her,
take that back as well.
[708.90] Is she worthy of wearing diamonds?
[711.01] God, she's such a blackmailer.  Do
you know what she said to me?
[715.40] I just couldn't imagine!
[717.04] She said she would help turn Shahzar
against Rameen, but there's a condition.
[721.97] She said marry me to Shahzar
after all of this.
[724.34] -How dare she!  -Come
on!  Has she seen her face?
[728.85] She'll get married to Shahzar.  As if!
Shahzar's status is way high!
[732.98] She doesn't even look at girls like her.
[736.13] -What else did she say?
-Oh, forget about it.
[738.30] Let it be.  Just tell me how do I get rid
of her?
[741.60] I regret calling her here.
[744.05] Take her hand and throw her out.  what else?
[750.47] She won't leave us so easily.
[763.75] We've only been married for three days
[766.05] and you're already
behaving like a typical wife.
[769.38] I don't understand what your problem is.
[775.14] You think I'm being a typical wife?
[779.01] Shahzar, you're my husband.
[781.72] If I won't share things with you,
then who will I share it with?
[785.39] If I won't talk to you,
then who will I talk to?
[788.17] Okay, fine.
[789.70] Tell me what is your problem with
my family?  What are your complaints?
[794.00] I have no problem with your family.
[796.79] There are some people like your nano,
your cousin Maria.
[801.82] They make me uncomfortable.
They say really weird things at time.
[805.24] Man, it's just for a few days.
[807.80] She'll shift to the hostel then.
She's my cousin, she can live in my home.
[812.15] As for Nano, she's an old woman!
[816.18] At her age, she doesn't know what she says.
[820.70] And besides, she is a cancer patient!
[823.50] Like your mom, she's also fighting cancer.
[826.52] You should be more understanding of this, be
more supportive.
[830.00] All right.
[831.87] I understand Nano's point of view.
[834.10] I'm sorry but I can't tolerate your cousin.
[851.61] You know why Mom sent me home
early from the office today?
[857.78] Because she wanted me to spend time
with you.
[862.20] With you.
[863.74] She called and scolded me, saying I haven't given
you any time since we got married,
[869.46] and she's right!
[871.21] I was so busy with work,
I didn't even think about you.
[874.82] But she's the one who made me think
about it.
[878.24] She told me to take you out,
take you for dinner, talk to you!
[883.87] And you have ill thoughts about her.
[886.53] I mean, come on.
[888.01] Think about it yourself.
[897.75] Please.
[899.34] Clean your heart for her.
[903.75] And...
[905.78] where is your bracelet that I gave you?
You didn't wear it today?
[910.97] Now let me explain.
[913.94] Yesterday, at the breakfast table,
[915.31] when Maria saw my bracelet,
she really liked it.
[919.38] And at that moment...
[922.01] Mom made me take off my bracelet
and she gave it to her.
[927.65] Mom?
[930.01] One... one minute.
[932.34] You didn't gift Maria
that bracelet yourself?
[936.06] Am I mad?
[938.70] Who told you I gifted it to her?
My "mu-dhai" gift?
[944.19] No...no one.
[946.38] I felt like it.  Just a thought.
Do you want to eat something?  Excuse me.
[952.79] what are you going to eat?
[962.01] This bracelet is exactly like the one that
I gifted Rameen.
[967.32] She gifted it to me.
[969.30] This...
[971.23] Rameen gifted it to you?
[973.12] Yeah, yeah.  She gave it to me
in front of Khala.
[975.44] You can call and ask if you want.
[977.54] She's a lovely girl.
[978.82] We became such good friends
in such a short time.
[981.17] I tried to refuse, but...
[982.88] she gave me such an expensive gift
just like that.
[984.99] She said it's a little old-fashioned.
I'll ask Shahzar to get me a new one.
[989.39] She forcefully gave it to me.
[1008.60] I was thinking that...
[1011.29] I should wind up the business.
I should find a job.
[1016.26] Job?
[1018.76] Yeah, man.  A job.
Is there any other option?
[1022.23] Umar, don't you think that...
[1026.00] finding a job at this age
would be easy?
[1030.95] Job is not related to age.
[1034.10] Jobs are related to experience
and I have a lot of it.
[1038.92] You've handled a business all of your life.
[1042.74] Now you're going to struggle for a job
at this age.
[1047.24] I'm still a young man, what's
wrong with me?  I'll struggle a bit!
[1051.80] He's right.
[1053.31] My son isn't that old.
[1056.45] Besides, if he doesn't get a job, then how is
he going to bear the home expenses?
[1060.17] No, Ammi, I mean how is he going to work
under someone else?
[1066.01] Child, if he's not used to it yet,
he will be.
[1068.75] Besides, Umar has worked jobs
his entire life.
[1071.85] It's a different thing how his status
changed when he married you.
[1076.18] We're still not used to all these luxuries.
[1081.14] I'm only worried about one thing.
[1084.31] How are we going to bear the
expenses for your treatment?
[1088.92] This worry is killing me.
[1110.56] Good morning!  Are you guys awake yet?
Can I come in?
[1113.21] Sure, sure.  Come in.  Please.
[1115.33] Where's Rameen?  Call her.
Look what I've got for you, Rameen.
[1119.00] Rameen.
[1119.89] Look at this!  Come, come.  come quickly.
[1123.68] Look at this.
[1125.12] These are our familial jewels.
[1127.38] My mother-in-law gave it to me,
and today, I'm giving it to you.
[1131.29] Come on, hold it.
[1133.59] You have a right to these.
[1135.83] No.  Now, you have a right to these.
[1139.90] In fact, in this house too.
You are the owner of this house!
[1142.80] -What you say will happen.
-No, Mom.  You're being unfair now.
[1146.40] You can give her all the jewels you
want, but you'll only control this house.
[1150.96] Don't come between a mother
and a daughter.
[1152.79] A mother and daughter?  That or a
mother-in-law and a daughter-in-law?
[1155.28] Daughter!  I've brought her here
as my daughter.
[1158.11] Wear it and show me.
[1160.44] Wear it.  Wear it, come on.
[1165.57] Touch wood!  They look so beautiful.
[1170.67] And here you go!  Your bracelet.
[1176.26] The one you gave to Maria
as a joke.
[1180.36] I thought you must have taken it back
from here.
[1182.79] But you didn't understand our prank.
I've scolded her too now.
[1186.38] She was sitting with your bracelet
since the last two days.
[1189.27] Come on, come quickly for breakfast.
[1198.91] - I didn't know it was a prank.  -All
right.
[1202.42] I'll believe you
that you had a misunderstanding.
[1205.96] But please don't exaggerate it now.
Finish this matter.
[1209.90] And one more thing, Rameen.
[1213.05] If you want to make me happy,
then keep my mother happy.
[1217.26] Because if you upset her...
[1220.32] then I'll also be very upset.
[1225.77] Come on.  Everyone is waiting for us.
[1244.96] Khala, if you wanted to take that bracelet
back, they why did you give it to me?
[1249.34] Maria is right.
[1252.33] And you gave her all the jewelry too!
[1255.32] Oh, Amma!  I only did it to show Shahzar.
I'll take it back.
[1259.95] How are you going to take it back?
[1261.35] I'll tell her it's not safe.  I have to keep
it in the locker.  The situation isn't safe.
[1264.67] She is very clever.
[1266.61] Just like Omar.  Greedy.
[1269.61] You don't worry.  I know.
[1271.98] I was thinking we should
be a little nicer to Rameen.
[1277.36] She tells every little thing to Shahzar
and she incites him against me.
[1282.15] How do you know she is inciting him
against you?
[1285.39] Shahzar's mood was off since the last few
days.  He wasn't speaking to me properly.
[1288.69] So I figured.
[1290.64] That whole bracelet thing?
[1294.60] We'll have to be smart about what we do.
[1297.87] Because I don't want Shahzar
to be wary of me.
[1301.44] And, Amma, you're not going to
say anything weird in front of Rameen.
[1304.62] Oh!  Another new drama.
[1307.47] Am I scared of someone?
I am not scared of anyone.
[1311.43] I say whatever is in my heart.
[1313.93] Whether someone likes it or not.
[1315.74] Amma, explaining something to you...
and you should be careful too.
[1320.70] I don't want Shahzar to have any doubts
on you.
[1325.40] Oh, Khala, don't you worry.
[1327.41] I'll do exactly as you've asked.
There won't be any errors.
[1330.78] But you didn't do the good thing
by taking that bracelet.
[1333.60] I liked it so much.
It had so many diamonds.
[1337.62] If you like diamonds so much,
so here you go.
[1340.84] Keep my diamond ring with you.  Here.
[1354.72] What does this woman want me to do
that she gave me her finger ring?
[1363.06] Kh... Khala, one--
[1366.05] Can I ask you something?
[1368.58] Tell me.
[1370.59] Do you have some animosity
with Rameen's family?
[1376.24] That is none of your business.
[1378.93] Don't ask me any foolish questions anymore.
Mind your business, understood?
[1385.67] The ring is very beautiful, Khala.  It must
be very expensive!  Such a huge diamond!
[1391.47] Look at this.  It is very beautiful.  Look!
[1395.62] I see it, I see it.
[1398.59] I see everything clearly.
[1450.40] Umar, who are these people?
[1453.79] what are they doing at our home?
[1456.18] They came from the bank.  He
[1460.57] came to inspect the house.
They wanted to check the papers.
[1463.39] They want to see how much the house
is worth, and how much will it sell for.
[1467.37] But why?
[1470.77] - I'll tell you later.  -Not
later, Omar!
[1473.51] Right now!  Tell me the right thing.
What else is left to sell?
[1477.53] What do I tell you?  What do I do?
[1480.77] I'm already very worried.  Don't bother me!
[1483.61] Do I harm myself or... or should I die?
[1488.41] Get free of all these problems in one go?
[1495.87] Hello!
[1498.37] Hi!  You're back early today.
[1501.09] Why?  Didn't you like me coming early?
[1503.54] No, it's not like that.  I'm just thinking
that a workaholic person like you,
[1508.87] how did you think of coming home early?
[1511.67] It's because I know my wife gets upset
without me.
[1517.08] Somebody will see.
[1517.94] So what?  Let them see.  We are married.
[1520.69] Why are you being so romantic?
[1527.33] I'm romantic since day 1!
[1530.98] But I had a good news,
so I thought I'd share it with you.
[1535.94] - Let's go out for dinner tonight.
-Sure, we'll go for dinner.
[1539.54] But what is the reason for this joy?
[1542.37] Because honestly, this is the first time
I've seen you so happy since our wedding.
[1546.09] - Really?
-Yes!
[1549.19] I found my love, I found you.
[1552.54] What can make me happier than that?
[1556.12] I've decided!  From toady onwards,
no more fights, no more arguments!
[1560.78] Life is very short and very beautiful.
[1563.23] And I want to share this beauty
with you.
[1567.44] -Remember this.
-Always.
[1571.59] The weather is nice, right?
The breeze is lovely.
[1584.18] what are you looking at?
[1586.60] I am looking at Rameen.
She looks very happy.
[1594.98] She got a little scared by your behavior
at the beginning.
[1598.63] And then she also worried about her father's illness
.
[1602.27] But look at her now.  Your gentleness
has really made her glow.
[1608.56] Did you see Shahzar?  He's so happy.
[1612.42] It's just for a few days.
Just wait and watch.
[1614.61] Oh, no, no.  You don't have to do anything.
[1617.71] Fate is doing a lot with him already.
[1620.98] I've heard his business has shut down.
[1623.65] He'll have to mortgage his
house to the bank too very soon.
[1626.92] But Rameen didn't let us know
anything about her family.
[1630.92] She never said anything to her in-laws.
[1633.46] It's possible she doesn't know either.
[1635.79] But soon, she'll find out everything.
These things cannot remain hidden.
[1640.34] Maybe now she'll think twice
before talking about me to anyone.
[1646.51] Look at Manal?  She's so happy
with her sister-in-law.
[1650.89] She's gotten a little too attached.
[1653.77] I don't like their closeness.
[1657.17] I think you should keep her on a leash.
[1660.18] In fact, quickly find a good proposal
for her and marry her off.
[1664.94] No, no.  She... she's too young.
[1667.02] Oh, it's better to marry off
such naive girls quickly.
[1673.10] Why?
[1673.93] She studies in a college with boys
and they know her father is a wealthy man.
[1679.69] What if someone tricked her
and she made a wrong move?  what then?
[1714.35] Hello, Rameen!
[1717.95] How are you?
[1721.69] Oh!
[1723.47] Are you still upset
about that bracelet thing?
[1727.80] It was a silly prank.  You got so serious.
[1731.68] It's all right.
[1739.12] So finally!  This bracelet is back
to its rightful place.
[1744.86] Well, honestly, this bracelet only suits
your fair and beautiful wrist.
[1749.59] And why doesn't it look nice?
Shahzar gave it to you with so much love.
[1753.67] And why would I take
your mu-dikhai present?
[1758.38] That's why, whatever happened,
think of it as a prank and forget about it.
[1764.56] And, look...
[1766.23] we're going to have to live in
this house together all our lives.
[1770.24] So why don't we become friends?
[1774.56] Time will be spent nicely.
[1789.63] Look at her attitude.
[1793.77] I'll see her!
[1797.28] The loan from the bank...
[1800.82] is almost 10 crore rupees.
[1803.93] This house is worth the same, but...
[1809.38] technically, I still have three years...
[1812.74] to repay the bank loan.
[1815.59] But since I don't have any means
of earning now...
[1819.11] how will I pay it back?
[1821.99] And the bank is aware that we've shut down
our business.
[1826.87] This is why they're after us.
[1829.10] Why don't you talk to someone?
[1831.64] Take help from a friend or something.
[1833.81] - Or maybe hire a lawyer.
-How can I hire a lawyer, Ammi?
[1839.17] The lawyers that are required for
such cases charge close to 30-40 lakh.
[1845.45] How can I pay such a handsome fee?
[1849.12] I don't know who cursed
our joyous home.
[1855.08] where are we going to go?
[1858.14] We'll move to a cheaper neighborhood,
find a smaller house on rent.
[1865.62] Yes, one more thing.
[1868.28] Rameen shouldn't know about this situation.
No one should tell her anything.
[1874.11] The house is in her name.
[1875.97] She is going to have to sign.
[1878.45] And you can't hide it for very long.
[1881.91] No, I didn't put the house in her name yet.
I was thinking about it.
[1886.53] The power of attorney is in her name,
we'll need her signature.
[1890.47] My daughter is very sensitive.
[1894.28] She'll be done once she hears
about her parents' downfall.
[1898.37] That's why I am telling you
to tell her everything on time.
[1902.23] We'll tell her once the time comes,
we'll tell her.
[1905.99] They're preparing for a reception now.
How can I tell her now?
[1910.35] She is newly married.
[1912.33] Let the kids be happy for a few days.
[1915.26] They'll know soon.
[1921.20] Your mother was diagnosed with cancer
and you didn't even tell me?
[1926.86] I wanted to tell you, but you know.
[1929.70] Your blood pressure gets high
the moment you hear her name.
[1933.59] You don't like her living here either.
[1937.68] I'll make arrangements for her
to be somewhere else very soon.
[1940.62] No, no, Tabinda.
[1942.79] You're wrong.
[1944.74] Look, Shahnawaz doesn't have any objections
with your mother living here, but...
[1950.43] he's just worried about the privacy
of his home.
[1953.62] Privacy?  Because of my mother?
[1955.30] If that is so, then you shouldn't
interfere in our personal matters either.
[1960.53] You know his views really well.
About my mother and my family.
[1963.99] You've been hearing it for years!
[1974.89] How are you talking to my sister?
[1978.11] Do you know how much older she is than you?
She's like your mother-in-law.
[1982.25] And my mother?  She has no status
or position.
[1986.78] If a mother-in-law is like a mother,
why do you keep insulting her?
[1992.56] And I never considered your aapa
to be my sister-in-law.
[1995.43] I've always thought of her
as my mother-in-law.
[1997.77] Before you lecture someone else on manners,
take a closer look at yourself.
[2000.76] Shut up!
[2003.07] - Otherwise, I--
- What are you going to do?  Divorce me?
[2005.74] And you'll send me where I come from to
this grand palace?
[2009.73] It's been years since I've been listening
to these threats.
[2012.85] I no longer care!
[2014.22] Yes, if I left this place,
then you'll definitely care!
[2018.28] Your son doesn't care about you.
[2020.34] If I leave, you'll be empty handed.
[2028.87] Get lost!
[2032.32] Remove yourself from my sight!
[2044.78] -Is everything good at home?
-Yes, Dado, everything's good.
[2048.85] Any problems?  Any issues?
[2050.78] Whenever I come here,
you ask me these questions.
[2053.63] Do I look happy to you?
[2056.80] You do look happy
[2057.73] but the horror stories you've told us about
your mother-in-law, obviously...
[2061.46] Ma, every house has some small issues.
[2064.18] Small?
[2065.83] -What did she do with my child?  -The
next day of her wedding,
[2069.02] she was so rude to her, her mother-in-law.
[2072.00] Dado, it was my fault.  Because of which,
I got a little scolded.
[2074.99] Otherwise, believe me,
Shahzar is an amazing husband.  Seriously.
[2080.24] And your mother-in-law?
How is her behavior with you?
[2083.11] How mothers-in-law behave.
[2086.64] Mine is very nice!
[2090.30] -Look, don't lie to me.
-Come on, Dado.  Listen to me.
[2096.21] Uncle and Auntie are very nice to me,
very sweet.
[2099.72] Specially Manal.
[2100.95] She's so nice, we've become friends.
Honestly.
[2104.65] I'm happy!  My God!  -Is
[2108.47] she telling the truth?
-Seems like it.
[2111.71] Be happy!
[2112.11] You just don't want to believe
your granddaughter.
[2115.37] Come on, I mean.  I'm happy.
Everything's fine.
[2117.93] You have any idea what's going on
at your in-laws?
[2120.97] Why?  What happened?
[2122.39] I've heard their company has gone bankrupt
[2124.40] the bank loans are so high that
they'll have to mortgage the house.
[2128.06] Who told you all this?
Is this true?
[2131.67] It's true!  It's strange that Rameen
didn't tell you.
[2136.01] I don't think Rameen knows anything
about it.
[2139.29] But she has gone to her parents' place
today, she will probably know now.
[2142.87] Oh.  Did she ask you before she went?
[2145.10] Yes, yes.  I dropped her.
It's her mom's birthday today.
[2149.97] Oh, right.
[2151.20] I think we should meet Rameen's family.
[2155.46] They could need our help.
[2157.57] I'll try to make sure they don't
have to mortgage the house.
[2160.81] That's great.  Let's do one thing.
Let's go over to meet them tomorrow.
[2164.48] We'll meet them and bring Rameen
back with us too.
[2167.68] Yes!  Anyway, take a look
at these cards.
[2169.83] It's for the annual dinner.  Select one.
[2172.86] How can I select it?  You always do this.
[2177.38] No, it's a little special this time.
[2179.90] Shahnawaz and I were thinking of hosting
a small reception to celebrate your wedding
[2185.66] and invite our friends and family.
[2188.49] But then we thought of hosting the
annual dinner and reception together.  -That
[2191.75] 's a good idea.
- Right?  Not bad.
[2194.18] Anyway, take a look.
Select which care you like.
[2196.03] I liked the beige one.
[2198.61] Yeah, I think...
this one is according to Rameen's taste.
