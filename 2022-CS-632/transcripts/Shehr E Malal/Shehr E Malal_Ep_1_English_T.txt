[15.06] No, no.
[18.14] See, it's very important for me
to get this project done by any means.
[23.43] It's very crucial for our company.
[26.05] Do whatever it takes,
just make such a quotation...
[32.29] What?  What do you think about it?
[34.33] I've done some work on this, sir.
[36.87] You must have heard of
Shah Nawaz Enterprises, sir.
[40.23] Sir, it’s a very reliable company, and
their previous record is also very good.
[45.28] Yes, but...
[48.17] our record isn't bad either.
[52.10] Make the quotation,
[53.20] and make it in such a way that they ca
n’t refuse, and we get this contract.
[56.71] Okay, sir, don't worry.  I'll prepare
and send the proposal tomorrow.
[60.13] No, not tomorrow, do it today.
[61.80] Even if you have to stay here until night, do
it and let me know today.
[64.75] I want to send it to them tomorrow.
[66.22] I'll complete it today and send it today.
You don't worry.
[69.99] Thank you.
[85.27] Take a look at this.
[88.05] This is Umar Hassan,
a major businessman from Lahore.
[92.44] But he’s facing a crisis
in his business there,
[95.17] so he packed up everything
and came to Karachi.
[99.51] What is it?
What are you writing in my diary?
[101.61] Hey, this is the signature I
will put on the marriage contract.
[104.87] - Oh, it's a special signature?
- Yes.
[106.58] Now you put your signature here, the same
one you'll put on the marriage contract.
[111.08] - What’s this?
- This is my signature.
[113.89] What kind of signature is this?
It's crooked like yours.
[116.64] Just deal with this.
[118.14] Man, what kind of girl are you?
Just take your diary.
[121.82] Did you read my diary?
[123.50] No, I didn't read it.  Just prayed on it.
[127.32] - What did you pray on it?
- The magic of love.
[130.52] - My advice to you is that you... -
You keep your advice to yourself.
[137.41] Oh, I was just making a suggestion.
[141.99] I don't need your suggestion.
[145.47] Who is the decision-maker here?
It's me, right?  Reject it.
[149.59] - Rather throw it in the trash bin.
- You are being unreasonable, madam.
[153.71] Just do as I say.
[159.50] It’s been almost two years,
[162.21] and in these two years, there hasn’t
been a moment
[164.49] when I haven’t mentioned your name
with my heartbeat.
[170.93] I never thought that our friendship
would turn into love like this.
[180.97] You are the most
beautiful feeling of my life.
[185.96] Now I can't imagine
living life without you.
[228.21] What’s wrong, Shahzar?
[230.89] I finally managed to fall
asleep after so much effort.
[232.69] I talked to you for two
hours and fell asleep.
[236.33] I needed to give you some good news.
[239.16] It'll make you lose sleep when you hear it.
[243.35] What’s the good news?
[245.62] I'm coming to Pakistan
the day after tomorrow.
[247.94] What?
[251.93] Thi-- this-- Why are you coming so soon?
[254.75] And why are you telling
me on such short notice?
[257.47] I wanted to surprise you,
but honestly, I couldn't wait.
[261.71] Well, that's okay, but...
[264.30] I mean, what's the reason
for coming like this?
[267.09] There are two reasons.
[269.63] The first reason is that Mom
is looking for a bride for me.
[274.56] She wants me to get married
and as soon as possible.
[277.49] If you wanted to marry someone of
your mother's choice, why didn't you--
[280.65] Some wretched person has told her that...
[284.05] the girl she's looking for,
I've already found her
[288.27] and her name is Rameen Ahmed.
[292.37] - I will only marry her.
- Okay.
[296.34] Sorry, I made a mistake.
[320.35] By the way, I've noticed that
since we moved to Karachi,
[323.84] you've been much busier with your business.
[326.37] Rameen also complained
that Baba doesn’t have time for us anymore.
[332.29] Now, it's a new city, a new place,
[336.04] new partners.  It takes time to adjust.
[340.56] Why don't you admit it?
You've fallen in love with your work.
[344.18] Even when you're with us,
your attention is always on your work.
[351.54] Yes, I remembered.
What was his name?  Yes!  Mr.  Manzoor.
[354.93] He has arrived from Australia.
[356.80] I was thinking of hosting a dinner for him
at home tomorrow, or maybe on Sunday.
[363.57] Umar, this Mr.  Is Manzoor the same
person who was a friend of my father?
[368.05] And also his business partner.
[372.20] What happened is...
[375.12] from his talks, it seems that
he is interested in our Rameen.
[379.19] - His son is studying medicine.
- Right.
[382.58] And from what I think, it seems like
he’s coming for Rameen’s proposal.
[388.06] Seriously?
[390.66] I really like the family.
If they propose, I will accept.
[395.47] Don't you think we should
ask our daughter first?
[399.82] Umar, Rameen is still a child.  How
does she know what's good for her or not?
[406.73] That's my point.
[408.20] Rameen is still a child.
Her education is not yet complete either.
[413.37] But, Umar...
[416.17] don't you think that... it
[419.02] 's time for her to be married?
[424.33] It's the last stage of the cancer.
[430.31] Before I die...
[432.44] I want to be a part of her happiness.
[436.95] You've fought so bravely against
this illness throughout your life.
[440.26] - What happened now?
- My courage has run out.
[443.89] I'm tired, Umar.
[446.30] I don't think I have much time left.
[449.37] Don't you dare say anything
like this again.
[452.28] Nothing will happen to you, and
God willing, I won't let anything happen.
[455.84] How long will you keep selling your
business shares to pay for my treatment?
[459.20] Until the end.
[463.34] I will keep selling until
there’s nothing left.
[466.27] If I have to sell myself
for your treatment, I will.
[471.76] But don't say anything like this
after today.
[475.79] Do you understand?
[477.88] That's it.
[479.52] Take care of yourself.
[503.66] Look.
[505.23] This color will suit you very well.
[507.12] No.  Shahzar doesn't like light colors.
[511.03] You're already thinking so much
about his preferences.
[514.51] See, when you love someone,
[518.71] you have to keep their
likes and dislikes in mind.
[521.80] If he doesn't like light colors,
why should I wear it?  Simple.
[525.28] You are a modern girl.
Such things don't suit you.
[529.65] Arwa, I didn't call you here for a lecture.
[533.26] Please quickly select a dress.  Please!
[539.76] This is a dark color, not bad.
I can wear this.
[543.73] Yes, just go with this.  Okay.
[545.90] And cancel all my appointments
for today.  I am busy.
[550.72] Ayub group?  Yes, set a time with them
for tomorrow after noon.
[553.58] Yes, cancel everything for today.
[555.36] Okay.  Thank you.
[558.94] Come in.
[566.05] Here are some documents for you to sign.
[576.74] I heard that Mr.  Shahzar is coming.
[580.96] Yes, Shahzar is coming after completing
his education.
[584.16] I'm very excited.
[585.98] And it’s also Manal’s birthday.
Today is a special day.
[589.08] By the way, madam, it’s a big deal
[592.50] how you’ve managed the house and
office after Mr.  Shahnawaz's accident.
[598.58] It's amazing.
[600.61] - Is that all?
- Yes.
[602.19] Here.
[609.00] Tabinda.
[616.11] That...
[618.27] I asked you for a favor.
[620.63] What?
[622.41] The one with the covering...
[626.68] It'll be done.
[628.10] Look, I also want to travel in a nice car--
[631.99] Don't worry.  I told you it'll be done.
[635.70] Thank you.
[637.37] Thank you.
[652.32] Okay tell me!
What do you think of my hairstyle?
[658.28] It's not that great, it's just okay.
[661.04] What do you mean?
[662.87] I made this after so much time and
hard work and you're making such bad faces?
[667.39] Oh, man!  I'm just kidding.
[669.61] Why do you take everything I say
so seriously?  I was just pulling your leg!
[673.62] You have to come to the airport tomorrow
to receive me.
[678.89] - Me?
- Why?  Don't you want to?
[682.48] No, I want to come, but...
[685.55] Look, I want your face to be the first
thing I see after coming to Pakistan.
[690.49] Shahzar...
[692.91] Your mom will agree for our wedding, right?
[698.13] I've told you a lot of things about Mom.
[703.11] She's my step-mom, but...
[705.38] she has loved me more
than my own mother would've.
[708.21] I'm sure she'll have no objections to it.
[711.60] You know this is the first time
I've heard this.
[714.02] Here, the concept of step-mothers is
that they're very cruel.
[717.73] Yeah, you're right.  They really are.
[721.69] And you'll see that once you meet Mom...
[725.09] you'll feel lucky as well.
You'll love her as much as I do.
[731.00] Now, you're praising her so much
that I really want to meet her too!
[734.83] But should I tell you something?
[736.22] Your mom's name should be
in the Guinness World Records.
[739.35] She is the best mom, the best working woman,
and the best wife.
[753.65] Don't you know Shahzar bhai is
coming soon?  Did you clean everything?
[755.97] - Did you clean the lounge?
- Yes, Dad, I did it.
[758.07] - And dusting the drawing room?
- Only a little bit is left.
[760.61] Clean it properly.  I don't want to see
any dust or spider webs.
[763.63] - Yes, Dad.
- Be careful.  Azar bhai is very special.
[769.82] Oh, and listen!
[771.93] Remove the bed sheets from the sofas.
They're still there.  Hurry up!
[777.68] Kiran!
[779.22] - Kiran!
- Yes, Dad?
[780.35] - Is the food ready?
- Yes.
[782.29] Okay.  You prepare the salad and the
yogurt sauce.  Fry the Shami kebabs too.
[786.81] And get the new crockery out
and make kheer for dessert, all right?
[789.91] Yes.
[792.22] Yes, dear, did you get your room cleaned?
[795.08] I got everything done under my supervision,
everything!
[798.26] Okay, child.  Just take a look at it again.
[799.24] You know about her, you know
how much she likes cleanliness,
[802.21] And get the bedsheets changed too,
and get the bouquets out.
[805.73] I just did it, Phuppo.  I'm tired.
[807.78] I can't do it anymore.
Why do you worry so much?
[809.88] I've done everything, everything!
[813.11] Oh, wow.
[815.19] Everyone's a little too excited
with Shahzar coming this time.
[818.06] You're doing a lot of preparations.
[819.67] There's another reason for it.
But you'll have to guess it for yourself.
[829.67] You forgot, right?
You forgot this time too!
[832.89] You forgot my birthday!
[834.78] I'm so sorry, my dear.  I'm so sorry!
[837.63] You always do this!  Sometimes
it feels as if I'm the step-daughter.
[841.16] Oh, what happened, child?
How can you even think that?
[843.61] I'm so sorry!
[844.89] This is what you always do!
You always forget her birthday.
[848.59] I'll go and cheer her up.
[862.64] Madam?
[863.92] - I've sent sir's clothes to the laundry.
- Good.
[867.23] Tell me what should I make for dinner?
[869.56] Umar's friends are
coming for dinner tonight.
[872.63] I'll sit with you
and properly prepare the menu.
[875.63] We'll do desi.  They like desi food.
There's chicken at home?
[878.70] - Yes.
- There's mutton too.
[880.17] - Yes.
- Oh, wow.
[884.84] Where are you going?
[885.78] You know my friend?  She called me over.
I'm just going to meet her.
[888.95] - All right?  Okay, bye.
- Okay, listen to me!
[891.97] - Come back quickly, keep your mobile on.
- Bye.
[897.64] Drive carefully!
[901.76] I don't know why this girl is always in
such a hurry.
[904.23] I don't know why Umar
gave her a car for her birthday.
[907.75] It's so unsafe.
[909.98] Dad doesn't even remember
his only daughter's birthday.
[913.12] And Mom?  She is always busy with office
and business.
[916.92] Sometimes I feel like I'm the
most useless thing in this house.
[920.37] Nobody cares.
[923.66] Manal.  Look, child, don't think like that.
[927.83] In this house, Bhai is always given
importance, and I am neglected.
[931.47] Mom still spends time with me, but Dad?
He has confined himself to his room.
[936.91] I'm also worried about him now.
[939.67] He argues with his wife about every little
thing and screams at the house staff.
[943.33] Was Dad always like this?
[946.15] No, child.
[949.95] You know, that...
[952.16] 20 years ago when he had the
car accident, he was left with broken legs.
[957.61] Since then, he has become so irritable
that he locked himself in his room.
[962.56] He doesn't look after the house
or the business.
[965.49] But, my dear,
it’s not that he doesn’t love you all.
[969.28] - He loves you!
- Then why don't I see his love?
[973.02] Manal.
[974.50] Why do you torment yourself
by thinking all of this?
[978.52] All of us love you, my child.
[981.44] Not all of us.
[983.12] Just you.
[984.37] If you weren't in this house,
I would have suffocated to death.
[987.55] - You are the best phuppo in the world.
- My baby!
[1008.26] It didn't come out great today!
[1010.81] Happy birthday to you.
[1014.39] Happy birthday dear Manal.
[1018.58] Happy birthday to you. - Give
[1023.73] it to Dad too.  Dad, Dad, Dad!
- Oh, Dad--
[1028.53] - And now it's my turn.
- Big bite!
[1061.86] I'll just go and give her the gift.
[1068.38] Take it carefully.
[1070.44] Yes, you fly!
[1072.07] Here you go, madam, your gift!
[1076.10] No, that's not it.
[1078.39] Gift!
[1080.53] - What's in that?
- In what?
[1082.50] In that!  That thing that you're hiding
from me.
[1085.61] Oh, man, forget about it.
There's nothing in this.
[1088.62] - I've got this for you, take this.
- No, first I wanna know--
[1091.33] No, I'm telling you.  Don't touch this.
This isn't for you.
[1094.55] This is for someone else.
[1096.14] Okay.  Okay, thank you.  Thank you very much.
[1099.55] - Welcome--
- Okay, Bhai, okay!
[1101.25] Give that gift back to me--
[1102.83] My gift-- Look, I'm telling you,
don't do this.
[1104.92] - Take this!
- I'm telling you, give it back.
[1107.31] - Here!
- Man, this is cheating.  This is--
[1110.12] - You tell me what's in this.
- Return it to me!
[1112.18] I-- I'm telling you!  You fly!
[1114.80] I'm running from here!
[1118.08] Give it back, I said!  I-- I--
[1121.17] Man, look!  This is cheating.  Don't do this!
[1123.60] Mom, I'm telling you.  This is very
precious to me.  I-- I'll not spare her!
[1128.59] - Don't move.  Don't move.  No, no, no!
- Give it back!
[1130.47] - Give it back!
- Manal!
[1132.42] - I'll catch you!
- What is this?
[1136.95] - Oh!  No.
- Don't move!
[1138.48] Ladies perfume!
[1142.87] - Who is it for?
- It's for me!
[1145.09] Who is it for?  Mom?
[1146.85] - Look at this!  Look at this!
- This--
[1149.51] This ladies perfume.
[1152.41] Ladies perfume for you?
[1154.59] No!  It's for Mom.  For Mom!
[1156.25] It's for Mom.
Then why didn't he tell you before?
[1159.55] Surprise!
[1161.21] - It's a surprise for Mom!
- You're lying, right?
[1162.79] Give it to me.  I'll give it to Mom.
[1163.73] - You're lying, right?
- I'm not lying.  I--
[1168.59] She's no naughty.  Look how she's messing
with her brother.
[1192.63] Hello?
[1194.34] Shahzar, where have you been?
I've been calling you for so long.
[1199.24] Don't ask me, man.
[1201.35] It was Manal's birthday.
We arranged a small party for her.
[1205.12] I was caught up with that.
It was hard to get out of it.
[1212.05] Hello?
[1213.91] What happened?  Are you upset?
[1215.77] Yes, I am.
[1217.92] But not because you called late.
[1222.09] I just didn't like it that you introduced
me as a classmate to your mother.
[1229.44] Right!  Then what did you want me
to say to her?
[1232.35] I should've told her, "Come, Mom. Meet her. I
[1234.83] want to marry her.
She's your future daughter-in-law."
[1238.17] Yes, so what?  What would have
been your reaction if you had said it?
[1242.24] I don't know, man.
[1244.02] I don't know, Shahzar.  I found your mom
to be the angry kind.
[1247.68] Oh, no, no.  There's nothing like that.
[1250.37] She looks a bit harsh when you look at her,
the angry kind.
[1253.35] But she's really soft otherwise.
[1255.68] She meets everyone with a lot of love.
[1257.88] And today she saw at the airport,
[1260.00] I was noticing her expressions,
she was very happy.
[1263.79] - That's why I've made a decision.
- What decision?
[1267.39] That you're gonna be my wife.
[1273.05] How'd you like my decision?  Come in!
[1275.96] - Oh, you!  I'll talk to you later.  Bye.
- Shahzar, listen to me--
[1281.62] A little longer--
[1283.29] Why did you have to do it?  I mean,
where's the house staff?
[1287.62] Has it ever happened before?
[1289.35] That I didn't do your chores myself?
[1291.98] - Yes, but I've grown up now.
- Not for me!
[1294.85] Yes.  Come on, finish it.
[1298.64] What's going on?  Your face is glowing!
[1302.33] Tell me something, man.
Do you know magic or something?
[1305.74] How do you read what's on my face, know what
's in my heart?
[1308.99] Who will know it if not me?  I read your face.
[1313.95] Tell me, who is it?
Did you like someone in America?
[1317.12] Oh, In America?  No way.
American girls are just--
[1320.59] Leave it.
Their stories aren't worth telling.
[1322.80] - This is someone else?
- Really?  Who is it?  Tell me quickly.
[1329.21] Her name is Rameen.
[1331.71] The one at the airport--
[1333.54] Who we met at the airport?
[1335.43] Man, you definitely possess some magic.
I'm telling you.
[1339.15] - Yes, it's her.
- How'd you meet her?
[1343.19] We just got in touch through the internet.
[1346.01] Slowly how the time passed,
[1348.94] and how we got closer and closer?
We didn't even realize it.
[1351.89] On the internet.  Interesting.
[1354.93] See it through-- Anyway.
[1357.47] I made so many plans for you though.
[1360.27] No, no.  You don't have to worry about it.
[1362.09] Rameen is not a typical girl.
You'll really like her once you meet her.
[1366.02] I'm sure.  She must be the best
if you liked her!
[1369.53] Come on, you rest.  You must be tired.
We'll talk later.
[1373.04] - All right.
- Finish this.
[1374.29] Yes, yes, yes.
[1375.43] - As always.  Good night!
- Good night.
[1385.81] Shahzar has become friends with someone
on the internet, Facebook or something,
[1390.80] some girl and now he wants me to take his
proposal to her house.
[1394.05] Then go.  What's wrong with that?
[1396.24] He has to marry someone.
[1398.63] Yes, but I don't know what kind of
people they are.  What their family is like.
[1404.15] I agree with you to that extent.
[1407.86] Marriage should be between
families of equal status...
[1411.02] or similar backgrounds.
[1416.05] These..
[1418.55] these girls are from small
and poor families.
[1424.01] They only look for money and property.
[1427.54] Even if it means marrying an old,
ill-tempered person.
[1431.80] I'm passing my life somehow.
[1435.22] But I can't let my son's life be ruined.
[1438.84] You're forgetting that you proposed to me.
I didn't propose to you.
[1443.12] You were the one who begged, not me.
[1445.47] Otherwise, with a man like you,
a bitter man like you,
[1448.96] I had no desire to spend my life with them
or marry them.
[1451.86] We got married for a deal.
[1455.37] You were attracted to my money
and my property.
[1458.68] It wasn't a deal, it was my necessity.
[1461.96] And I regret it.
[1463.41] I'm thinking why I severed my own foot.
[1466.58] You're right.
[1468.68] At this moment, you would either be the
wife of a clerk or a shopkeeper.
[1473.16] - And he would've shown you your worth.
- Maybe that would've been better.
[1476.81] What do you want to prove
by saying all these despicable things?
[1479.36] The money and status you talk about,
Mr.  Shahnawaz,
[1482.74] who's handling all of that?
[1484.39] Who's looking after your home
and your properties?
[1487.12] Who looks after your office?
[1488.96] If it had been anyone else apart from me,
they would have left you a long time ago.
[1493.12] You should be ashamed.
[1494.50] It's not me who should be ashamed,
it should be you!
[1498.11] You've taken control over everything
anyway!
[1500.54] You caused my children
to become estranged from me.
[1502.99] I don't know what spell you've cast on
him;  He keeps moving around you constantly.
[1508.14] You're right, he's not my blood.
[1510.67] I'm not related to Shahzar by blood.
He's my step-son!
[1514.83] But how can you deny the fact
that I stay awake at nights for him?
[1519.42] I've raised him!
I've cared for his future.
[1523.32] I've loved him more
than a biological mother!
[1525.92] There must be some agenda
of yours behind this too.
[1527.83] Stop it!  Stop it, Shahnawaz, stop it!
[1533.38] I'm tired.
[1535.93] I'm done!
[1537.06] With your bitter and hateful words,
you have driven me away from yourself.
[1542.75] What do you want now?  You want to kill me?
Kill me!  Kill me too!
[1547.17] I haven't found a single moment of
happiness from you in this entire life, - not
[1551.14] even a moment.
- Happiness?
[1554.25] Happiness?
[1557.63] You've taken everything from me.
What do I have now that I can give you?
[1565.28] You want happiness?
[1566.81] Your control over my property.
You have everything!
[1570.17] You never even dreamed
that you'd have all of this!
[1573.29] Enough, Dad!
[1574.90] Enough!
[1577.57] I'm ashamed.
[1579.06] I've come back after such a long time
and your behavior is the same with her!
[1583.94] - Son, she--
- I won't hear a single word against her.
[1588.38] If you don't speak to her respectfully...
[1591.56] then I will leave this house myself.
[1595.11] But I'll take her with me.
We'll live in some other house.
[1599.00] Son, you don't know this woman.
She's a very sharp and clever woman--
[1602.90] I told you I don't want to hear
another word.  Don't you get it?
[1606.83] She's my mother!
[1608.99] I only say this to you, please, Dad...
[1612.74] speak to them with respect and calmness,
because if you don't...
[1619.30] then I won't ever see your face again.
[1653.84] I've gotten used to this behavior from him.
[1657.11] In all of these days, not a single day passed when
he didn't taunt me with this.
[1663.10] Why does he even taunt you
about your status?
[1666.82] People aren't big
because of their status, they
[1668.40] 're big because
of their character and... I've
[1671.03] learned it all from you.
[1674.28] He hates people with a lower status.
[1678.70] He also thinks that I married him
for his money.
[1682.97] - It's not like that though, Shahzar.
- Why are you explaining it to me?
[1686.83] I know full well that
there's nothing like that.
[1689.97] And trust me, no one understands you
more than me in this house.
[1695.58] I can't change the way he thinks, but...
[1698.32] I have this request of you that...
[1701.13] don't put yourself down
because of the things he says.
[1716.15] No, he's being stubborn.  He says if
he marries someone, it will only be her.
[1720.87] He has asked me to take his proposal.
[1723.00] Just say no straight up.
There's such a good proposal in the family.
[1727.42] So what's the point of establishing
a relationship with strangers?
[1731.27] And besides, your niece Romana, that
[1734.19] poor girl is an orphan
and also destitute.
[1738.19] Ammi, I don't want to say no like this
and look bad in his eyes.
[1743.02] You know how hard I've worked to achieve
this status in this house and family.
[1749.55] You were saying he's very obedient
and compliant.  What is this issue then?
[1755.92] The situation here is
completely the opposite.
[1758.37] You yourself remain subdued by him.
[1760.72] Oh, no.  It's not like that.
[1763.11] I don't want to say no like this
and make him wary of me.
[1767.16] I don't want to ruin
everything that I've done.
[1770.19] I'll take the proposal there.
[1772.36] I'll see who the people are, how they are.
[1775.84] It's possible that I'll like the girl.
[1778.07] Yes, how simple your husband is,
she'll be like that too.
[1783.22] And how many times have I told you
to get your share in the property.
[1787.87] Get it in your name but no.
You don't listen.
[1793.55] You don't worry about me so much.
[1797.12] Sleep now.
[1836.94] God.
[1840.41] Oh, Mehru, answer me at least.
[1843.09] What do I say to Mr.  Manzoor?
He wants to come over in a few days.
[1849.87] Umar...
[1852.27] you should say no to them.
[1856.21] Just tell them that...
[1859.70] Rameen said no.
[1862.49] Why?  He's such a nice guy.
[1865.86] I agree!
[1866.84] He's a good guy, the family is good,
the proposal is also very good, but...
[1872.14] Your daughter likes someone.
[1874.90] What?
[1879.40] Look, Mehru, you know that it's
the most important decision of my life.
[1885.22] How can I just marry her off to any
random man that she brings over?
[1888.90] I'm sorry!
[1891.13] This marriage isn't possible.
No matter what!
[1893.24] Umar... our daughter has grown up now.
[1897.32] She knows what's good for her
and what's not.
[1899.37] And her consent is very important
in her marriage.
[1903.78] And I want to tell you that the guy comes
from a really nice family background,
[1908.21] and he has done civil engineering,
he got his degree abroad.
[1912.96] Civil engineering?
[1915.94] Thank God he's an educated guy.
[1918.80] Tell me more about his family.
[1929.91] I have faced a lot of torment
since marrying this woman.
[1935.47] I mean, she never misses
an opportunity to belittle me.
[1944.22] Tell me what happened now?
[1947.15] Didn't you see?
[1949.58] Without telling me,
without asking for my opinion,
[1952.66] she has gone to fix my son's marriage.
[1956.90] Shahnawaz, she's only gone to see the girl
for now.
[1961.28] She'll ask us both
before finalizing the proposal.
[1965.08] She doesn't deem us worthy of it.
[1968.50] She's the queen of this house.
She wants to control everything.
[1972.96] Have you not seen how Shahzar
keeps praising her virtues?
[1978.30] Look, she has been manipulating
Shahzar like a puppet since childhood.
[1983.23] It's nothing new.
[1986.11] -You torment yourself for no reason.
- So what else do I do?
[1989.92] I... I don't want to be a spectacle
of my own helplessness.
[1994.88] Enough!  That's enough!
[1997.40] I can't tolerate it anymore.
[2000.66] Look, Shahnawaz,
[2002.95] there's one thing.
[2005.01] She may not be a good wife,
but she is a good mother.
[2010.15] She has raised your children as her own.
[2015.37] You'll have to accept it.
[2016.98] That woman must have
some agenda behind this too.
[2019.58] She knows it really well that my son
is the sole heir of my property.
[2024.08] 21 years!  I've been tolerating that woman
for 21 years!
[2028.28] I've come to know every aspect of her
in these 21 years.
[2031.45] She won't even offer someone a glass
of water without an agenda.
[2035.65] She can't love anyone!
[2038.22] This is all your fault.
[2041.34] You're completely fine.
Take care of your business.
[2045.03] Why did you include your wife
in your business?
[2048.23] It's not my fault, Aapa.
[2050.21] It's your fault.
[2052.17] You forced me into a second marriage.
[2055.88] You wished for Tabinda, I did.
She was your choice.
[2060.59] I was never in favor of this.
[2062.66] You forced me to take this bitter sip.
[2072.62] Rameen was telling me you're a business
woman and you're a homemaker too.
[2076.60] She was really praising you.
[2079.09] Just...
[2080.98] After my husband's accident,
I had to do it.
[2084.26] But he's here now.  He's handling everything.
[2086.55] But I'm not interested in
Dad's business at all.
[2089.53] I've decided to sit in for CSS exams.
I'm preparing for that.
[2093.96] That's so commendable that today's
generations want to do something themselves.
[2099.72] Auntie, please have some brownies.
I baked them myself.
[2103.58] Really?  Okay.  Then I'll have to taste it.
[2106.77] The brownies are really good!
[2108.36] - Really?
- Oh, you have a sweet tooth?
[2110.22] Yeah, I do.
[2114.30] It's tasty.  What does your husband do?
[2117.59] He has a business that he looks after.
[2120.02] Actually we've shifted here from
Islamabad a few months back.
[2124.60] - From Islamabad?
- Yes.
[2126.05] Right.
[2126.99] I'm sorry.  Actually,
I told him you're coming,
[2130.82] I think his meeting ran late.
He's on the way, he's coming.
[2134.69] I understand.
It happens.  It's not a big deal.
[2138.16] - No problem!
- Oh, Baba!  You're here!
[2139.99] - I know I'm late.  I'm so sorry!
- Baba, we waited so long for you.
[2156.77] Umar, this is Tabinda.  This is Shahzar.
[2160.39] - Salam, Uncle.
- And Shahzar's sister, Manal.
