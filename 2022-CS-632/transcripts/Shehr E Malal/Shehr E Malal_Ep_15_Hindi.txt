- Do you talk to Kamran?
- Kamran who? Oh, the one who's in love with you. 
Who else? That cheapster? Loser? So what? Talk to him.
Meet him once or twice. Fine, he's the owner of the company. But I've established everything for him. He didn't earn a single penny 
with his own efforts. Amma, today I saw Minal with a guy
in a car. So you didn't ask who that guy was? I did. I think Minal is involved with him.
And she told me he has proposed to her too. Okay. But who is the guy? What does he do?
What's the family like? I don't know too much, but Minal has met
him recently. It hasn't been a lot of time. Maria has met him though. 
She said he's smart, good looking. It seems as if he belongs to a good family. So it means it's been a few days
since she met him, and Minal has already decided to marry him. And she has also issued a certificate
of him being a good person! Wow! This is why I used to say to keep an eye 
on the girl. Don't let her go out on her own.
But... but you? Shahnawaz. Tabinda doesn't have any fault 
in any of this. I told Minal to learn how to drive,
to go out on her own. Look, we can't restrict our girls too much
in the society that we belonged to. And love marriage is a fashion now. You're right. It's very common these days. Now that Shahzar has
married of his own accord, Minal is set to follow in his footsteps. But... who is the guy? What's his family like? I... don't know a lot. Just that... his parents passed away in a car accident 
some 20-25 years ago. They had a nice business,
he's an only child. Have you heard of  Shah Motors? Oh, really? Shah Motors? The ones who import cars from abroad?
That on? The same. Yes. I knew Mr. Zafar. He was a big businessman
and had a solid reputation in the city. You're right. He passed away
in a car accident 25 years ago. His son is handling everything, 
looking after the business too. So you know them? Yes, I knew them.
But I've never met Kamran. I've heard he's doing very good work,
he's also well-off himself. And he also a very good reputation. He's 30 years old, touch wood,
but he hasn't gotten married yet. Look, we can inquire about he guy. We'll fine out about his
family background too, but it's better to meet him
and see how the guy is. I knew Minal's choice wouldn't be bad. We should meet and see. Okay, tell Minal to invite him over for
dinner tomorrow night, I want to meet him. Minal... My dear, how could you decide he’s the
one after just meeting him a few times? Phuppo, you can figure it out in one
meeting too, can't you? And am I a child? I go to the university.
I meet new people everyday. And Kamran isn't lacking in anything. Except that he doesn't have anyone.
No parents. But, dear, still. There's some-- Whether you decide after
careful thought or impulsively, what's meant to be will happen eventually. So even if you find a guy for
me after thorough investigation, what's the guarantee
that he'll keep me happy? You have to take a risk in marriage
because there are no guarantees. Child, it's not good 
to be so over-confident. Tabinda, you should talk to her. What should I tell her? She's a grown up.
She can make her own decisions. I'm sure whoever she has liked
is a good guy. She's intelligent. You don't worry. See! You worry needlessly.
She still thinks of me as a kid. You'll always be a kid for her,
and for me too. I'm always concerned about her. Okay, enough. Enough!
Stop worrying about me. Thank God, Mom.
Finally this rat girl has liked a guy. She had 50 proposals
but she always had some objections. The guy is short, he's overweight.
He's cross eyes and God knows what else! Absolutely not, Bhai.
You're just over exaggerating. Really! No, no. Not 50. She had a 100 proposals. Madam doesn't like anyone.
We'll see which weirdo she has liked. Mom, don't call him a weirdo, and Bhai?
Don't be jealous. I haven't liked some ordinary guy.
You'll be start struck when you see him! Mom, I think it's a good opportunity.
Quickly invite that guy, fix her proposal 
and send her away from here. I know you want me to leave this house 
as soon as possible. Not as soon as possible. I want you to leave this house today. I'm your only sister
and you want me to leave this house? Yes! I'm joking, I'm just kidding.
Why do you take everything so seriously? Look, it's a technical thing. You'll have
to understand it. You'll leave this home, so I'll have all of Mom's and Dad's
attention. My importance will increase! You're still the favorite child.
Mom gives you the most importance. No. Everyone is the same for the parents. Did you see, Mom? I told you.
She's jealous of me. No way! Me? Jealous of you?
It's impossible. You'll miss this shot. See? You see how bad her gaze is? Sir, apart from this,
we have other varieties of sports cars. We'll imported if from Germany 
in the last few days. Sir, it's a brand new model. If you want, 
we can schedule a visit for you. Yes, sir. Yes. Sir, Mr. Shah is calling you. Tell him I'm coming. Okay, sir, I'll wait for you. Thank you. Thank you so much. - Sir, may I come in?
- Oh, Kamran. Come in. Sir, you called me? There are some complaints 
from the customers. Complaints? Sir, I don't understand.
What kind of complaints? It has come into my notice that some people from the sales department
aren't working properly. They're roaming around in my absence. And I've especially heard it about you that you take some customers' cars
and go out during working hours. No, no, no, sir. It's not like that at all. Sure, sir, I've gone out once or twice
but because the client asked me. I took their cars for maintenance. Sir, you know me, right? I'm loyal to you. Sir, tell me yourself. In these 2 years, have you ever heard
any complaints about me? No, sir. Right? This is why I was thinking to hand over
everything to you before my visit to Japan. But after hearing all these complaints 
about you, I'm thinking... Oh, no, Sir. You go 
without worrying about anything. I'll handle your entire business, in fact, I'll look after your house 
and your farmhouse too. Okay, fine. Do one thing then, keep the keys to my
Clifton apartment and farm house with you. And keep visiting them during my absence. And yes, I've sent all the servants
for a month long vacation. All right, sir, of course. 
By the way, sir... when will you be back? I'll be back in a month or 2. Hello? Yes, I've seen the car. It's nice. Anyway, I'm going to Japan.
I'll be back in a month or so. In my absence, 
Kamran will look after everything. Okay. He's going to Japan for a month. His home... his penthouse, and his farm house... he's handing everything over to me. Everything's under my control now. Very good! Everything is going according to our plan. You have to be very careful and very smart.
Do you understand me? No one should doubt you that you're
Kamran Ahmed instead of Kamran Shah. Just an ordinary manager at this company. Not ordinary. Very special. Anyway, forget about it. Minal called. Her parents wants to meet me
as soon as possible. They've invited me
over for dinner tomorrow. It's possible they'll set the date 
for the wedding too. That's what I feel too. Do one thing, before you meet them,
meet me. Minal's parents have some reservations. In fact, I want to tell you 
what you should say to them. All right? Meet me first. All right. I'll meet you. What do you mean Mama's at work? Didn't she tell you about her job? I talk to her almost daily, she
didn't say a word about any job. Child, I didn't know she was hiding it 
from you. It's been one week
since she started working. And you've also come 
after a very long time. So how did you and Baba allow this 
to happen? Both of you are well aware
of her condition. Child, I told her no. But it's not like
anyone listens to me. You and your mother do as you will. When nobody listens to me,
why should I interrupt? - Where's Baba?
- He's in his room. Baba! You're having Mama do a job? In this condition? You know everything? but still? I don't understand 
how you could be so selfish. Will you keep talking or will you give
me a chance to say something too? What I'm saying is right.
I'm only telling you the reality. You've used her money your entire life
for your own personal use. And when she needs you... you've gotten her a job 
at that third-class factory! I didn't send your mother to work. I asked her not to, I got angry too.
I even begged her. But you know how stubborn your mother is,
she doesn't listen. Yes, of course. I know how stubborn she is,
but I also know you. You must've told her not to get a job
to fulfill a formality. But you must've thought you're
getting money sitting at home. Because you know what your reputation is,
nobody wants to employ you. Seeing all of this, what other option
did she have instead of working? Thank God I didn't say no
to marrying Shahzar for you. I don't know what your issue is
with his parents. They're offering you highly coveted
position, but you're not agreeing. Who filled your head with so much poison
against me? Why are you so disgusted of me? I didn't commit a sin. I didn't ruin your grandfather's business. I didn't use his money for anything wrong. I don't believe you, I'm sorry. How can I begrudge the world
when my own daughter wouldn't trust me? Baba, after everything that's happened, I'm sorry, but you don't hold
the same position in my life anymore. Specially after what you've done with Mom. After today, I won't call you Baba
and I won't come to this house either. De-- I'm sorry, but you don't hold
the same position in my life anymore. After today, I won't call you Baba
and I won't come to this house either. Yes, it was nice to meet that guy. 
He's nice. Very decent and sensible. And he matches us in status, and
most of all, his family is also very good. Whatever may be, Shahnawaz, I don't like that all of this is happening
so quickly. No, no. We'll do a thorough research. I think we should complete our inquiry
as soon as possible. It'll be better. I'm just happy about one thing. That he's independent, alone.
There's no family or anything. Him being alone is what's bothering me. What are people going to say?
We've given our girl to an orphan. There's no one in his family. If he doesn't have parents, 
he could've brought someone else with him. Chacha, Taya, Mamu, is there no one
that he came alone? Yes, I didn't understand it either. Oh, he told us why his family cut him off, 
right? They've set their eyes on his wealth, they want to make him their
son-in-law so he's cut them off. Look, if the girl isn't happy 
at her in-laws, if there's no inner peace,
so all this money, wealth, status, none of it matters, it's all useless. What do you people want? I only want what Minal wants.
I want her happiness. Did you see how Rameen attempted 
suicide for Shahzar? Things got so out of hand,
we had to face so much humiliation. I don't want Minal to take any such step, 
God forbid. I won't be able to tolerate it. I just want Minal to make
whatever decision she wants, anything that makes her happy 
makes me happy too. Oh, my God! Minal! Evil eyes off! You looked so pretty. You're so lucky! You're getting married
in such a nice family. You looked very pretty today. Man... such men are fated to be with rich girls
like you. A middle class girl like isn't even
fated to be with a middle class man. Why are you saying that? Let me just get married, I'll find a proposal for you myself.
That too very high class. Thank you so much! You're so nice. You're the only one in this house
who understand my pain and value me. Otherwise your Bhabi and Khala
don't even talk to me. You saying this is enough for me. Yeah, even I don't get to talk
to Bhabi anymore. Sometime back... weren't you very attached to her? Yes, but I stepped back 
after her cold responses. God knows what she's so arrogant about. Anyway... I'm feeling very nervous.
How is the family going to respond? Oh, you don't worry at all. I've just heard it. Everyone's very happy,
everyone liked him a lot. And why wouldn't they? 
This is the kind of proposal Khala wanted. Someone who lives alone
and has a high status. Just be mindful of your dad and phuppo. They might object to him living alone. Don't worry about anyone else. Just get them to agree, 
everything else is fine. Shahnawaz is absolutely right. Why is Kamran insisting to get married
so quickly? Even I don't understand this. We have to be very careful
with daughters' marriages. You should inquire about this guy too. Oh, Amma, why are you getting worried? For your peace of mind, I've inquired
about him. The reports are good. He belongs to a good, well-reputed family. He's the only heir. He's very wealthy too.
I think Minal will be very happy with him. You're right. But I can't seem to be at peace
with this proposal. Wedding in a month? How is this possible? What do you need for a wedding? What do you need for preparations? 
Money, right? Look, neither side is lacking.
Everything will be fine. You don't worry. We'll send off Minal
with a grand celebration. Tell me though, who's going to
come in barat from Kamran's side? He doesn't have any siblings. I've heard he has boycotted his family too. Then how is his mehndi and wedding
going to take place? What can we do now? We'll have one event, 
a very big grand reception. What? Just one grand function? That's it? What's wrong with you?
She's your only daughter. Amma, honestly... I'm happy with whatever makes Minal happy,
it's that simple. I'll do as she says. That's it. All right, it's up to you. Thank God... that your parents agreed
to this wedding. Otherwise I was very scared that... the way they were investigating me... I was unable to understand anything. I don't why, but I feel that... they're very opposed to my living alone. You won't be living alone anymore. I'm coming into your life forever. You have no idea how impatient I was
to marry you. You can't even imagine... how happy I'll make you 
after we're married. All of life's luxuries... I'll bring them to your feet. Marrying me... won't ever be a matter of regret for you. I know. I trust you. Although your dad and phuppo
don't seem too excited about our marriage. - What if they try to stop our wedding?
- Dad? Dad has an old habit of getting
caught up in worries and doubts. As for Phuppo, she'll be happy
with whatever makes me happy. By the way, Mom and Bhai were very happy
to meet you. In fact, ever since Mom has met you,
she's not tiring of praising you. She's really happy with this marriage. Forget about her. You tell me. How happy are you
with this marriage? I'm very happy. I'm so happy that I can't even express it. I never thought that a guy like you
would come into my life. And you know... I wanted my life partner exactly 
as you are. You just make me happy. And I don't know how to explain that. Thank you for being a part of my life. How can Mr. Shahnawaz agree to this? He's
marrying his daughter to an ungrounded guy. It's shocking. The only thing missing is that he is alone
and orphaned. What else is he lacking otherwise? Tabinda has found a very rich party
for her daughter. A greedy woman like her would
want a rich guy who's alone. Rameen was telling me he has a business
worth billions and he's worth millions too. Amma, speaking of Rameen... I've called her so many times,
she doesn't answer. She hasn't replied to my messages either. Maybe she... is upset with me. Not maybe, she's definitely upset with you. She doesn't like you doing
this ordinary job at the factory. Not just her, Umar and I
don't like you working either. Quit this job as soon as you can. Here, here. Quickly take this.
My hand is burning. - Be careful.
- Oh, my-- Your coffee and my tea. Thank you so much. You should've told me,
I would've made it. No, you're working.
I thought I'd make tea today. I'm not working, I'm stuck. What? What are you doing? Actually, I have to make a flow chart for
profit productivity. I don't know how to! I never learned power point presentation. Show me. - What is all this?
- This is all the profit-- Oh, this is a total production chart. Okay.
Take this and tell me all these figures. And-- In fact, do this. Come here, 
I'll teach you. - Yes.
- Here, we transferred the file. Here, we clicked on the new file
and added the data... Find out... what are they giving Minal in her dowry. Oh, they're giving her shares
in the property and the business. And I've heard her phuppo say
that she has a share in this house too. This house is worth 18 corore 
and the business is worth billions! What am I going to do with all of this? Look, I don't want all of this. You must find a way to tell them 
to give cash and jewelry to Minal. No, man, no. I can't do that. You should tell it 
to your wife-to-be yourself. In fact, tell them that you
don't want anything in dowry. Really? And what if they
actually sent Minal empty handed? Oh, they're very cultured people
and she's their only daughter. They'll never do that.
They won't send her empty handed. No, man, no. I can't take such a big risk. And you know I have to reach Dubai
in one month, right? I've seen a property there
and I've promised to pay 5 corore too! Look, I'll divorce Minal
as soon as we're married. I know. I know everything about your plan. But use your head and don't be so hasty
with everything. You've already made them suspicious
by asking for a simple wedding. I don't have any other option
except for a simple marriage. Where will I get fake relatives and
millions of rupees for a grand function? We'll find a solution for this too. Where so many lies have been told,
creating 3-4 relatives is no big deal. Let me tell you something though. This old man, Shahnawaz, he doesn't
seem very happy with the wedding. I'm telling you. In order to impress him,
you must tell him you don't want any dowry. Just keep doing as I say,
then you'll see the results. Anyway, tell me... have you arranged for jewelry 
and everything else? How will I arrange so much money?
I don't get it. - You're here.
- Here you go, man. It's a check for 25 lakh. Take your fiancee for a shopping trip
of her dreams. What is this? Just 25 lakh? Man, they're a big party. The total budget for the wedding
is 40 lakhs. Look, man, try to understand.
I need complete 50 lakh. Why are you looking at me like that? I've told you I'll return everything
with interest before I go to Dubai! Okay, fine. Tomorrow morning, I'll give you a check
worth 50 lakh. But remember your promise. 
I'll take it all back with interest. Why are you worried, my friend? Minal's father has promised 
to give 3 corore. I'll transfer everything to my account
on the wedding night. But how are you going  to do all of this? I mean... how can you just transfer like that? That's the problem, man! How am I going to do all of this, 
topped with the wedding expenses. There are jewelry expenses. - I don't know how this will be done.
- I have a plan. Why? My uncle's son owns a jewelry shop. He has a huge business of diamond 
and gold. We can rent the jewelry for two days. In fact, I can get a fake diamond set
made for you. No, man. No, no, no. This is all useless. They're rich people! They're from a well reputed family. They'll recognize it immediately
and I can't take such a big risk. Our entire plan will be ruined 
if we get caught. Okay, don't worry. 
I'll arrange a diamond set for you. You can thank me later. - What a friend you have!
- What a lovely friend you are! Tell me something though. You're an amazing man.
You have a solution for everything. After all, I'm your friend. Umar. It's so late and you've not slept yet. I couldn't sleep. What are you thinking about? You wake up early in the morning. You finish all the house chores,
then you go to your office. You work there all day 
and when you come back all tired... then you start house chores 
all over again. All of this stress isn't good for you. I can't sleep at night because of this. Whenever I think about it, I... - I feel like killing myself sometimes.
- What are you saying? Control yourself, Umar. You acting like this stresses me out. I'm not doing anything unusual.
A lot of women do this. And circumstances don't always 
remain the same. You weren't jobless your whole life. Just have a little patience. And take such thoughts out of your head. I don't mind being patient.
I've been patient my whole life. But I don't know how long 
I can be patient for. I'm worried about you. You've supported me my whole life. You never left me alone. But seeing you in this condition, 
seeing you work, I don't like it. Look here. I'm completely fine and happy. You're my strength. You can't become weak. I have full faith... that God must've something good 
in store for us. Since when have you two been
having these misunderstandings? And you never shared it with us. If Shahzar says anything wrong now, I'll go to your mother-in-law
and complain to her. Dado, there’s no use in doing all of this.
And please, don’t say anything to auntie. Because it's not her fault. She's always taking my side anyway.
She keeps scolding Shahzar. Dado, you know I was slow
to understand her. I was wrong. Her words may be harsh, 
but her heart is very kind. But what has happened to Shahzar? Why is he so wary of you? I don't know, Dado. He's at the office all the time,
he comes home so late. We can't spend any time together. And the time we do get, 
he's always fighting me. Everything that he used to like about me... he dislikes them all now. It's possible that he's very busy, dear. That's why he's unable to give you time
and you're misunderstanding him. No, Dado. I don't have any misunderstandings 
this time. He has... he has actually changed.
Specially since Baba said no to that job. I think he got offended. He behavior has become even more harsh
since then. Anyway, you forget about it.
Tell me, how are you? I'm fine, dear. What can happen to me? But eve since you misbehaved with Umar... both of your parents
have become very worried. You should come 
and apologize for your behavior. Dado, I won't apologize to them
because I'm right. And Mama also told me that
I can't come there anymore. And I won't come there until Baba resigns
from that job. You're just like your mother. Dado, I'm right. 
And I'm not being stubborn. What can I say, dear? I've gotten
more worried after talking to you. I'll pray to God that everything is well. Khala, can I give you an advice though? Transfer all the money you were going
to spend on her wedding into her account. You mind your business. 
I know what I have to do. Go inside and do something. So it means everything is going
according to plan? What do you think of your friend? I've woven such a web 
that the whole family is now tangled in it. Kamran, you have no idea how excited I am
to go to Dubai.
