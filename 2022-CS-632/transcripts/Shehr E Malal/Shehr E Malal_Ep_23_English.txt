[Music] My heart is filled with sorrow I lost my mother in my husband's house and if any of you tries to come there or try to make contact with me, I will leave my husband's house. Have you locked yourself in your room? Get out of that room, what will I do by getting out? Continue your studies, meet your friends. What will happen by staying locked in the room like this? Nothing will change. Get out and face the world. I cannot face the questions of the world. You go away, leave me to my mercy and what will happen by crying and wailing. See, time does not remain the same. Gather some courage Manal, get out. You are not the first girl with whom all this has happened. A lot more happens in life, one has to endure a lot. You have not seen the world yet. I thought you were very brave, I know you are not a coward. [ Music] You wo n't listen to me, don't you trust me? Come on, well done, let's go out. I will make you do a lot of shopping. [Music] Yes, meet a friend.  It is okay, whatever your heart desires, tell me what you want to do, okay, come on a long drive with me, we will listen to songs, we will go on a long drive, then we will have something to eat and then we will not hear any denial, come on, let's go, well done [music] go, who got this contract done? Hell, I am responsible for you, sir, your most favourite and trusted uniform employee, Mr. Hasan sahab. He had given the contract to this company and he has also collected the commission of crores. Sir, please see this signature. This is the same contract in which we had discussed the commission with Umar sahab, but sir, the issue is that the amount of two crores has been given to him in the form of cash instead of a cheque. Otherwise, I will bring all the transactions from the bank and show them to you. Okay, yes, please send this to Umar sahab, foreign please, thank you, it's unbelievable nonsense, salam, sir, sir, you called me, I called you, what have you done, what kind of a game is this? You have signed this, sir, I have signed this, but the terms that you are seeing on the last page are not my terms.  I signed it, you are lying, your signature is present in it and you have taken commission, the question arises that what is the purpose of this, sir, I did not take any commission, why don't you tell them that you did not take commission, there is proof of everything here, why are you standing here looking at me, take this, you want to destroy my company [Sangeet] I do n't understand, despite being so educated and from the city, you did such a thing, but sir, I did not sign it, either this signature is fake or this term is not the one which I had decided with them and sir, your signature is mentioned, I signed it on your insistence only [ Sangeet] [Sangeet] I have thought of something for you [Sangeet] [Sangeet] Just be careful, while trapping him, you yourself should not get into any problem, no one should have any kind of good luck, oh madam, don't worry at all, I got him to sign very cleverly and got a letter prepared by giving 2 lakh rupees to the trap manager of this contract, which will come to know about it  That Umar Hasan sahab has been taking illegal commission on every cash collection of the order, so why be afraid, I will talk to you later, okay, who are you talking to, how did you come to my room without informing me? Yes, I am asking, whom are you talking to and with whom are you playing this love game with me, you mean you should mind your own business here, you mean what have I done wrong to you, why are you doing all this to me, do n't tell me in a straightforward manner, I know how to lose from here, sir, tell me why are you doing this to me, I just pushed the security guards, oh security, you have been terminated from here, what does terminated mean, you will cheat me, push him out of here, he is cheating, he is cheating, he has cheated me in connivance with someone, oh leave it, leave it, why don't you let me go [Music], did he not come to know anything, did he not come to know that all this is happening at my behest, oh no ma'am, you did not know anything about you, but I have been trapped very badly  I have said that until he is not arrested, he will come here again and again and will keep blackmailing me and while leaving he was saying that I will take you to the court and nothing will happen to the one who is involved in the plan. He has no proof against you nor any solid proof, how will he prove it in the court and the lawyer cannot do that. Now be careful, we cannot afford such blunders. [Sangeet] [Sangeet] and by giving â‚¹ lakh to the manager of this cant, I have got a letter prepared from which it will be known that Kimar Hasan sahab has been taking illegal commission on every cash recovery of the order. If I were in your place, I would have got him arrested immediately. I told him that your daughter is a fool but I never expected this from you. Instead of getting him arrested, sitting and apologizing, where is he? Tell me his address and where is Shajar. Tell Shajar to get him arrested today and right now. Listen to me, do n't evolve the police, it will be of no use to them, anyway they are not going to be affected by everything.  etc. he has returned the money, if we involve the police then it will only bring disrepute, you try to understand, now he is just falling at your feet and asking for the mafia, how did he even think that we will forgive him and why are you speaking in his support, did you forget that when he left our daughter on the wedding night and went away, we should trust him again, you are right, I cannot forget, I cannot forget in a moment, maybe for the sake of my mind we will have to swallow this bitter pill and he is really apologizing a lot, if the one who forgot in the morning comes home in the evening, then he is not called forgotten, beware, beware, if anyone utters even one word in his name, he is my daughter's culprit and this is a matter of my daughter's life and there must be some reason behind him returning the money and jewellery, he must have thought of something new, tell him, tell him to divorce my daughter and quietly go out of her life, I will talk to my lawyer tomorrow itself and will send him a khula notice and will get him arrested [Music] you are lying, your signature is present in it and the commission is also there  You have asked me the question is what is the purpose of this now are you looking at my face you want to see my [Sangeet] company you didn't do any shopping I did n't feel like doing it anyway I didn't like anything ok let's eat something I'm feeling hungry let's chair up it's okay come here [Sangeet] I have full doubt that guy [Sangeet] she is a very clever woman I never thought that she would stoop so low in her enmity what has she done you try to prove yourself innocent by any means otherwise you can be punished [Sangeet] so it seems you will be punished the police can arrest me at any time how cleverly she got me to sign wrong signatures and the company with which I had signed the contract she also got the finance manager of that company with her how but son how do you get yourself out of this quagmire [Sangeet] keep up your courage son you are not alone I am with you we will talk to a lawyer ah I don't have thousands and lakhs of rupees to pay lawyers now  It seems as if jail is my fate, keep up your courage my child, I cannot let you break down like this, this test, Allah puts his special people through such tests [Music] Allah will make everything better, you just pray, Allah will make everything better [Music] ok, tell me what to eat, I don't have anything to eat, you order for yourself, I don't want anything to go wrong [Music] Manol, how dare you, leave from here right now, I did not hear anything you said, please tell me one thing, go from here and hand him over to the police, listen to me, after that whatever punishment you can give, I did not listen to anything you said, just go, what is happening, mom, mom, tell him to go from here right now, hand him over to the police, just tell him to leave, listen to him, I had called him, please Anaal, Manal, listen to me [Music] [ Music] what kind of doubt do you have, yes, our finance manager Rizwan sahab works with me in the office, a few months ago, he gave me some files and got me to sign, in a hurry, I had to go to the hospital, my wife's  I was very unwell and was in a hurry, so I could not read those papers. I think Rizwan sahab, who you suspect, has been framed badly. All the evidence is going against you, but tell me how did you suspect him? Actually, I heard him talking to someone on the phone, very clearly. The court does not believe hearsay. The court needs solid evidence and I will try, but in this regard, you too will have to be very careful. Well, tell me, there is no resentment, any animosity or professional jealousy between you two. There cannot be professional jealousy because we had different jobs, but I am sure that Rizwan sahab did all this to me at the behest of someone. Who could it be? That man is the chairman of Malik Shahnawaz Group. He is a very famous name in the business world. There is no animosity or any animosity between you two. Look, there is no animosity, but some time back, I was engaged to him and he was engaged to me, but intentionally we could not continue and after that, for so many years, he never told me anything.  I did not meet her, now suddenly she came back in my life like this and then after a long time I saw her, I think she wants to take some revenge from me for that time, listen to me, listen Manal, I will not go anywhere with you in future, try to understand me, listen to me, why did you take me to meet Kamran, why should I forgive him, what kind of a mother are you, you do not value your daughter's passion, you are misunderstanding, mom, just leave it to me [Music] listen, what has the lawyer said, he will fight your case, Ami, he did not refuse to fight the case, but Ami, I do not have anything to give him, it is a blessing, it is his great kindness that he agreed to fight this case without any old connection, I cannot understand where he has trapped me, I do not have any proof against that Rizwan and dragging Tab in this case means that my daughter's home will be ruined, she will never let her home settle down, that woman will soon come down on high before this  You bring Ramin here, I am thinking that I should back out from this case, if they misunderstand you then who is going to think me right, everyone is misunderstanding me, at least my daughter's house will be saved, not mine, you are innocent, you have to prove yourself innocent, face the difficulties bravely, I am with you, you need not be afraid of anyone, I am trying, but I cannot give anything else to my daughter, at least I can save her house from getting destroyed, I have never seen you so sad before, what should I do, on one hand there is this case and on the other hand how should I let my daughter's house get destroyed, she should make such strong evidence against me, I get surprised, sometimes see [Sangeet]' s barrister was saying that the chances of my case getting dismissed are very less, he also has no hope, Allah will get it out, he will make it better, of course Allah will make it better, Ila [Sangeet] [Sangeet] what is the issue with you, why did you call me Minal, please do not hang up without listening to me completely, I am requesting, what do you want to say to you, I agree that there is greed  I did a very bad thing when I came here but now I have realized my mistakes I have realized that I truly love you Hey, if there was no love then I would not have come back and I would not have returned all the things to your mother Now what do you want from me, an apology I have forgiven you but do not call me in future nor follow me If you are seen around me then I will complain to the police Please please do not hang up My talk is not over yet Minal I do not want an apology from you I want to live with you too Stop it, I can forgive you but I cannot live with you never I know Minal my mistake is very big but you are the owner of a very big surf I am sure that one day you will definitely forgive me [Music] If I forgive you then you will also be good to me [Music] [Music] So true I want to make coffee for you [Music] I know what you are going through I know you did not like mom's decision Nest I also felt very strange [Music] Hearing this a man like Kamran should be forgiven again Giving a chance is no less than a mistake. A person who can stoop so low for money can do anything [Sangeet] He has gone out of my heart and I can never give that person that status and respect. I understand, but Mom is pressurizing him, saying that she wants to bring Kamran to this house. [Sangeet] Look, don't think too much, I will talk to Mom myself about this. Talk about it. You don't need to talk in our domestic matters. Whatever decision I take for Baral, I will take it. I know what is best for him. Did n't you understand? There is nothing like that. I was just explaining to him. What were you explaining? We do n't need your advice. Kamran will come to this house as a son-in-law. You should understand this. And you should worry about your father more than us. Ever since your mother passed away, you haven't even given a lift to your father. Okay, whatever he is, good or bad, he is your father and in this bad time, you should be with him. What do you mean? Do n't you know, your father has two crores.  A case of embezzlement has been filed against Umar Bhabhi. She got the job with great difficulty, on my request and recommendation. How could I have known that I would have to face so much humiliation. Some people do not like respect. But Sahab is an old acquaintance of ours. We have been associated with him for years. Your father has humiliated us. We are not able to show our face anywhere. I ask the driver to take her to meet her father. She will be fine mom. Bhabhi. Everything will be okay. Just relax, please Bhabhi. [Sangeet] How did all this happen? Why did you not tell me? Your father did not do anything. You being a daughter, are not taking revenge on him. So why should I trust strangers? You explain to her [Sangeet] What can I explain? I am very upset with her. We have lost our sleep. After all, we had such an old relationship with Sahab. We were business partners and now, why didn't you tell me? You have been enduring everything of yours alone. I and Umar called you so many times, but you kept ignoring us. After mother's death, you turned back.  You did not even bother to check on us Umar even went to meet you but you turned him back from the door, does any child treat his father like this? Dadu, you know very well why I am angry with him, he insulted me in front of my own relatives. This job was got to him by Shajar's family and before doing this, he did not even think what effect it will have on his family. Ram Meen, what happened, come on, I did not bring you here to tell you all these things. Grandma is also alone like us in this situation, we should support him, do n't worry, we are with you and everything will be fine. Anyway, what is your fault in this whole thing, Umar is not at fault either [Music] Sari Umar Hasan sahab's lawyer sent a legal notice from the court, in which it is mentioned that I got his forged signature done and trapped him in the accusation of ban, see believe [Music] Umar, my goodness, there is a limit to even a tie, one is theft and on top of that, chest-thumping. Hey, he should be thankful to me that I did not get him arrested till date, sir, this is  You have a high command, right? But I think that now we should not give him any more leniency. His crime is unforgivable and he should be punished as soon as possible. You know, Razwan, actually he has sent this notice to blackmail me. Sir, he wants me to come under pressure due to the fear of my clients and the fear of failure in business. I should forgive him. But this cannot happen, never can happen. [Music] What are you saying? I tried to convince you in every way, tried to make you understand, but you did not understand. Kamran will stay in this house as a son-in-law. This is my decision. That cheap, deceptive person you are trying to bring into this house has already apologized to you. Whatever he had looted from us, he has put it at your feet. He has absolved himself of his mistake. This is enough. Our daughter has already suffered a lot because of your wrong decision. Now once again you are trying to push her into that quagmire. You do not need to worry about Minal. I am there to take decisions about her life.  For example, Minal, I also have a daughter. You have not brought her with you as dowry. And listen to me, that person will never come to this house. I cannot allow that at any cost. I will make him take account of every single thing of my daughter. And listen to me carefully. If that person comes to this house today, then you and your mother will leave this house forever. Speak in a low voice. And you also listen carefully. If you try to mess with me in this matter, then I will get you admitted to a mental hospital. And mind you, your son Shajar will get you admitted there himself. You woman, you have brought my son against me. I am your life. [Music] [Music] Shajar Shaj Minal, look what has happened to your dad. Come quickly. Come quickly. Look what has happened to your dad. Come to the hospital. Hurry up. Hurry up. [Music] What happened, son? Everything is fine. You are very worried about your son-in-law. I am not worried about my son-in-law. I am worried about you. I am scared that you might do something like that.  Do it so that we all get into trouble Hey, don't worry, nothing like this will happen to me, then talk to me I told you that I will do something such that even the snake will die and the stick will not break Majur, this sahab was already a laborer, now he is completely pardoned, I thought that maybe he would get rid of my life but come on, it's no problem, you will be lying in some corner of the house like a living corpse [ Music] [Music] [ Music] [Music] I told you that I will do something such that even the snake will die and the stick will not break Majur, this sahab was already a laborer, now he is completely pardoned, I thought that maybe he would get rid of my life but come on, it's no problem, you will be lying in some corner like a living corpse [Music] Shaj Shaj what has happened, what are you thinking, he was thinking about mom, mom, where is he, he is with dad, the doctor has discharged him, just go home, you're okay, yes, I'm fine, I'm fine, come on, come on, let's see, let's talk to the doctor, come on, come on [Music]
