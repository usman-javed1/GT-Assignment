Kamran can't do this. How can he leave me
and marry someone else?  No, no. But there is something... What if someone is poisoning her mind
against me? Someone is turning her against me? Sir, pleasure working with you. This company doesn't feel like I'm working
elsewhere, it's almost like a family. That's good, that's really good. Anyway, your dedication... and your style of working, - it has really impressed me.
-Thank you, sir. You've probably met the
rest of the staff already, but today you'll meet Mr.  Rizwan too. In fact, he's our Finance Manager. Yes, fair enough.  Thank you, sir. - Come, come.
-Good morning, sir. -Hello, Mr.  Omar.
- Please. Rizwan, sit. I was just talking about you
with Mr.  Omar. Mr.  Umar, meet Mr.  Rizwan. Did you talk to Mr.  Rizwan? Yes, I did.  In fact, he just came
back from vacation yesterday. We spoke in detail. Did you explain everything properly to him? Of course, I explained everything. He even promised that
within the next two months, he'll trap Mr.  Umar
in an embezzlement case. And tell him he will be rewarded very well
for it.  Don't worry. I had already mentioned this to him, that's
why everything else is moving forward. anything else?  Any updates? Anything else...Yes!
Important update.  I forgot. The update is Mrs.  Umar has quit her job
at the factory. I mean, she has resigned. She had to. With her husband getting such a good job,
what does she need that low-paying job for? And the project from the Dawood Group? Yes, Mr.  Shahzar is working very hard
on that project, with a lot of dedication. I've already handed
over all the files to him. -Hello!  -Kamran
speaking. Ka- Kamran! Why are you calling
from a different number? I'm calling from a friend's phone to tell you that... the chapter of you in
my life is closed now. You don't mean anything to me. My mother must have told you. I'm getting married,
and I've already found a girl. You're such a scoundrel!
You are a pathetic person! I did everything for you! I picked you up from the ground
and put you in the sky, and this is how to repaid me? I will not forgive you. I'll go to your home and tell your relatives
everything you've done to me. I'll tell them how you came into Tabinda
Khala's house and married her daughter, and how you robbed their house too.
I'll tell them everything! I'll tell them every single thing you did! If you open your mouth, I'll ruin you. You've already ruined me. But listen, Kamran Ahmed. I won't forgive you so easily. I won't let you get away. I won't let you get
away with this betrayal. You understand, right? So go and do whatever you want.
But remember one thing. People in my family will never lose trust a
character girl like you. Who would want you as a daughter-in-law? A girl like me? Look, I don't want to argue anymore. This is the last time I'm calling you... just to tell you not to wait for me. I am never coming back to Pakistan. Goodbye. You... can't do this to me. You don't know... You don't know who has betrayed you. what is this? What is this madness?  What happened to you? It... it... It slipped by mistake. Control your hands.
Clean this up as soon as possible. Come on! She has lost her mind. She was fine in the morning.  -What happened to her in the evening?
- I don't know. She's acting weird.
I don't know what happened to her. Strange. Did she say anything to you? I tried asking her,
but she didn't say anything. I don't know what happened to her. Now that Minal is doing better,
she has started acting strange. I think it's something to do with a boy You're 100% right. She's had a couple of affairs before too. Oh, I told you, right? I always suspected her behavior. I told you not to keep her here.
But you didn't listen to me. Send her away now. What I brought her here for, she
didn't do that.  She's completely useless! She doesn't do anything
at the office either. She's only making money.
Just taking salary. And I don't like her hanging out
with Minal too much. It's her who filled Minal's head
with rubbish too. Seems that way. I'm telling you, take her by the
hand and throw her out immediately. It's a new drama everyday. You are right. He's living a luxurious life in Dubai
as a millionaire because of my plan. He is giving the happiness I deserve
to someone else. What did I get even after doing so much? Nothing. I am left with nothing. If Khala kicks me out
and sends me to Hyderabad, I might even lose this job. What do I do? What do I do?  I'm so lost. I can't understand. The person who ruined my life, his daughter
is living her best life in my home! I can't do anything. You need to make Shahzar hate Rameen. Fill his heart with so much hatred
that he is compelled to leave her. But no, you're focused on
Umar, his job, and business. How do you think Umar has
reached where he is today?  Because of me! I won't rest until I get him behind bars. Look at that girl!
She's so happy with Shahzar. And look at our poor Minal. She is just sitting here
after being betrayed. She's so young. Betrayal is all that is written in the fate
of you mother and daughter. , Umar left you for wealth... and my daughter is
stuck in this situation. I won't spare Kamran. I will make him regret
this for the rest of his life. You forget about him for now. Shahzar told me about Rameen's illness
in passing. What illness? He didn't tell me about it. He mentioned it to me
because you were at the office. I think she might be expecting. No, that's not possible. If it were true,
Shahzar would have told me first. -No, it's not like that.  -Come
on! It's your drama.  What can I do? Listen. Yes.  yes, Khala? Pack your things and get ready to leave. But, why?  Where will I go? Your house.  what else? But what's my mistake, Khala?
What have I done wrong? It's not your fault, it's mine
that I trusted you so blindly. The task I called you for didn't happen.
So what's the point of sitting here idly? But at least tell me what's my fault?
What mistake did I make? Why did I call you here?
what was your task? Your task was to create a rift
between Rameen and Shahzar. And what did you do?  The results are zero. Then what is the point of sitting here
and doing nothing? And who's the guy you've been crying about? Which...which guy?  Well, I don't know. I know girls like you very well. I can't take responsibility
for you anymore. I don't know who it is that you're having an
affair with. If you ran away with him, what am
I going to say to your family? No, Khala, I won't do anything like that.
Trust me. - I won't do anything like that.
-I don't trust anything you say. Khala, you-- you-- I'm begging you, Khala. Please don't do this to me, Khala.
Where will I go? - I'll do whatever you say.  -Talk
softly. Please don't send me away from here, Khala.
Where will I go? If you want to live in this house,
so you'll have to stay within your limits. You'll have to stay away from Minal. I can't tolerate Rameen anymore. I want Shahzar to humiliate her
and throw her out himself! You have to make that happen. Okay, I will do it.
But what am I supposed to do? I am going to the office now.  You
need to be there too.  We'll talk later. Fine, I'll meet you there. This is a risky job.
You have to be very careful. I hope you won't disappoint me. Keep this in your bag. What?  what's this? wow touch wood. - Salam!
- Rameen! Oh my god! May you live long.
What a pleasant surprise! Is everything okay?  How do you think
your mother is so early in the morning? I only come here because I miss you. Otherwise I always have to cancel my plans
because of Baba. Anyway, what were you doing? Such a beautiful flower has grown out.  Did
you see it? I was just watering the plants
and then I'll prepare lunch. You're staying for lunch, right? Your grandmother went to buy vegetables.
She'll be so happy when she returns! Mama, I have to leave, but I
wanted to talk to you about something. But you have to promise
that you won't tell Baba. - Rameen, are you all right?
- I'm completely fine! Then? Just promise me you won't tell me Baba.
It's something about his job. About his job? What happened?  Please... don't worry too much. It's just that Baba's ego is so massive that he doesn't accept anyone's help
nor is he able to do anything for himself. Please don't talk in riddles. Frankly tell me what you're trying to say. The job he's showing off about these days,
my mother-in-law made it happen. Because his own reputation is so bad
that no one wants to employ him. I just want to correct your misconception
that he got the job on merit. No, that's not true. Why did your mother-in-law do this? Do you have any idea... that if your father is found out,
he'll resign immediately! So please don't tell him then. This has to stay between us. I wish you didn't tell me either. Ammi, I can't shoulder such
a big burden all on my own. Your main task is to create misunderstandings
and rifts between Shahzar and Rameen. - Do you understand?
- Yes, Khala. You're close to me, you're my family,
I can only trust you. This is a risky job,
you'll have to be careful. I hope you won't disappoint me. Oh, no, no, Khala.  I am loyal to you. I can't even imagine betraying you.
You don't worry. Okay, keep this in your bag.  -What ...what is this?  -These
are the birth control pills. You have to give them to Rameen
every carefully without her knowing because I don't want Rameen
and Shahzar to have kids. So what?  Is she about to become a mother? Oh no.  This is why we have to give her
these pills. do you understand me?  You're
gonna have to do this very carefully. Nobody should find out. Okay, all right. Should I go? Baba has such a massive ego that he doesn't accept anyone's help
nor is he able to help himself. The job he's showing off about these days,
my mother-in-law made it happen. Because his own reputation is so bad
that no one wants to employ him. I just want to correct your misconception
that he got the job on merit. No, that's not true. Why is Tabinda doing all of this for us? Why is she doing so many favors to us? What is the reason behind this? First, she kept insisting on employing Umar
in her company. When he didn't agree to that,
she referred him to Mr.  Baqar. As far as I know her... Tabinda isn't a soft hearted woman,
nor does she have a big heart. Then why is she bestowing so many favors
on Umar? Maybe because of Rameen. Omar.  When did you get home? I just came back a little while ago.
Ammi was telling me Rameen was here? Yes, she was here. So did you tell her about my job? Yes, I told her.  She was very relieved
and very excited too that you've finally got a job, touch wood. You should've asked her to stay. I told her, I insisted that she stay, but
she had to go somewhere, that's why... You go and fresh up, I'll make tea for you. what are you hiding? Is something the matter? Have I ever hidden
anything from you before? It's nothing. Listen to me carefully. Give Rameen this medicine
daily, mixed in juice or milk. And it has to be done daily!  Do you understand? This is a very difficult task
you're asking me to do. Oh man!  You're going to get paid
for this too. No, no.  I can't do this.
Please ask someone else to do this. I cannot commit this crime. You're acting as if I'm asking you
to give her poison. Don't worry. This medicine will not have any effects
on Rameen's health. Although it would thwart Mr.  Shahzar's
dreams of becoming a father. -Come on, do this.
- But... don't worry. Keep it. You can't even think about the
money you're gonna get for this. Just make sure that no one finds out
about this in the house. do you understand? Come on, go. Poor Shahzar. Yes, child, I heard you were unwell. Oh, there's nothing to worry about.
Just had a minor dizzy spell. One second.  Were you feeling dizzy? Oh my God!  You know, it's not bad
for newly married women to feel this way. It's a good thing, actually. -What do you mean?
-I think you're pregnant. Why don't you come over?
I'll take you to a gynecologist. Can I come over to you right now? Yes, of course! - I'm coming right over.  Wait for me.
- Okay! I brought fresh juice for you. Why don't you knock before you come in? And you gave me fresh juice in the morning,
you've brought it again. Mr.  Shahzar has told me to
give you fresh juice thrice a day. And if you don't drink it, I'm
supposed to make you drink it myself. Give it here. Okay, you can go. And please knock before you come in. -Oh, where are you going?
-I was just going to meet Mama. But you were unwell.  You should rest. No, actually, I was tired of resting. Then Mama called that she was going
for shopping, so I thought I would join her. Do you have any objections? No, no.  Why would I object? I can't stop you from coming
and going anywhere. But, look.  For me, you and Minal
are the same. Whatever I say, it's for your own good. You've just got married, and I
feel it's my duty to guide you. Now you're a part of this house, and with this relationship,
you have some responsibilities. Right? You are the daughter-in-law of this house,
Shahzar's wife. Now... it doesn't look good to go to
your parents' house every day. This is your home now;
you should take care of it too. This house has some rights for you too. -Mom, that's true.
-Now don't say you get bored. No woman ever gets bored in her own home. You'll have kids soon, God is willing,
you know how much Shahzar likes kids. You won't even have a single minute
to step out of the house. Take care of yourself. I think you should rest.
It's better if you stay home. I've done her thorough check-up,
I've also gotten a pregnancy test done. But she's not expecting at the moment. But her blood pressure is very high. I think she's under a lot of stress and
she's not taking care of her diet either. I'm prescribing some multivitamins to her.
Please make sure she takes them. Also, try to give her some mental peace. Sometimes, mental stress
and pressure can delay pregnancy. But there's no need to worry; we have couples who haven't
had children for 6-7 years. Just have faith in God. Mr.  Umar, I've checked the quotations,
and I need your signature. I was so excited to hear
about your pregnancy and then... Amma, what's there to worry about?
Didn't you hear what she said? It's only been a little while since I got
married and you're already stressing out. Yeah, Rameen. But you know how everyone is so excited
for their children's children. And I think that… your position in that house will strengthen
once you have a child. How did you come up with that? Do you think I'm not happy in that house? I don't know, Rameen.  Because
you are not sharing your feelings with me. If you ask me, I've noticed that
since your marriage to Shahzar, I have n't seen true happiness on your face
even once. I don't understand why. I don't understand what the tension is.
Even the gynecologist said that, right? -One minute, Mama.
-No! What is stressing you?
We got you married to Shahzar, right? One second. I am not stressed because of Shahzar
or his family. Then why are you stressed, dear? My stress is because
of your husband, Mr.  Omar. It's his actions that
raise my blood pressure. And now, because of his presence,
I can't even step into my own house. Seeing his face makes me angry,
and that's why my blood pressure is high. Sir, as you said, I've ordered the quotes, and Mr.  Rizwan is
aware of everything too. I want you to review them once
and then finalize the decision. Mr.  Umar... I don't have time to get
entangled in these matters. This is a finance-related issue;
please discuss it with Mr.  Rizwan. Sir, I told him the same thing. I've checked the quotes, but I
think the previous one is better. However, I want you to
make the final decision. -Mr.  Omar, let me ask you something.
-Yes sir. Do you have any doubts
about Mr.  Rizwan's loyalty? No, sir.  Absolutely not. If not, then go ahead
without any hesitation and fear, and work based on Mr.  Rizwan's suggestions.  -All right.  Very well, sir, very well.
-All right? Done.  -Thank you.  -Thank
you. -You may go.
-Thank you, sir. Whether you're hungry or not,
eating is very important. Since when did your blood pressure
get so high? It's pretty normal, Mom.
BP goes up and down. We care about your health,
even if you don't. After all, you are to carry forward
the name and lineage of this family. Don't stress too much.
It's not good for you.  Huh? Oh, so this is what the mother
and the daughter-in-law are talking about. I was also thinking why is Mom so worried
about you these days. I am already so excited.
I've started thinking of names too. God knows what time will come. Hopefully, soon.  I'll distribute sweets
in the entire city! Sure, you can do that.
However, it's too late. We'll go and you should sleep too. Come on, come.  Good night. How long has it been since your marriage? Almost two years. But in these two years, you haven't
shared any good news with us. What? Shahzar badly wants children. Maybe he doesn't want to hurt you,
so he hasn't mentioned it, but he keeps telling me,
he's even chosen names for the kids. Not just Shahzar, but his father
also wants grandchildren. I'm worried that their wish might
not be fulfilled in their lifetime. I think you need to
think seriously about this. Mom, not everything is under my control. You're a woman, you understand how it goes. I'm not blaming you for not having
children, I'm just trying to explain. It's been two years since you got married.
Two years since you've been in this house, but I feel like you've never considered
this house your own. You live here like a guest. Mom, that's not true.
You know I'm trying hard. You haven't really tried, that
's the problem. Ever since you got married, you're always focused
on your parents' problems. You're stuck in those issues, and that's causing you so much stress that you're neither happy yourself
nor keeping Shahzar happy. I've noticed recently
that Shahzar seems upset. Even at work, he's not fully engaged,
he doesn't feel like being at home either. And I am sure his sadness
is because of you and your family. Let's be honest, you know very well that... he had to suffer humiliation
and embarrassment because of your father. Now, I feel that if you
give him the joy of children, maybe you can win back
his attention and love. Don't let it happen that, as he grows more
distant from you, he finds someone else. Mom, that will never happen.
I trust him completely. A man's love is like changing seasons, sometimes warm, sometimes cold.
My job was to explain this to you, what you do after that is your choice. Mr.  Umar, I have checked the quotations
and it is ready for your signature. Sure, I'll sign this.  I... Let me get done with this,
I'll give it to you by evening. Oh no.  We need to
forward this order quickly. But who will check it? Mr.  Umar, Sir will check the final numbers.
I'm taking this file to him. Really? And one here too. And that's it. Please make sure to show this to Sir. -Yes, sure.  -Do
take his approval.  -Thank you.  -Thank
you. I can't wait anymore. My heart wants Umar
Hassan and his family to be ruined and destroyed
right in front of my eyes. I want him to fall so low in the
eyes of Rameen and Shahzar that he can never raise his head again. The time for revenge on
Umar Hassan has come. I will talk to you later. You will see him behind bars very soon. Talk softly!  Talk softly.
what's wrong with you? Shahnawaz has come to the office today. I'm not that crazy! He has gone out for a meeting
with his son. Still, there are others at the office.
Anyway, tell me, what's the news today? There is no report today. There's just good news today,
just good news. Tell me. Everything is happening
just the way you wanted. And the first strike against
Umar Hassan has been made. Here's how it happened:
Umar Hassan signed a paper, and a duplicate of his signature was made, which was used on other legal documents. Now you'll see how quickly Umar
Hassan gets trapped and ends up in jail. Rameen, my love, stop for a second. Stop crying.  You've been crying ever
since you came here.  Tell me what happened. I have been having some very bad thoughts. Please tell me what happened.
Did someone say something to you? Mama, I can't believe it, I misjudged her
so much. She's such a strange woman. I mean, when she's good, she's perfect.
Like, there's no better person than her. But sometimes she says such strange
things that one wonders what is going on. Tell me, love,
what did she say this time? The same taunts about being childless. If I can't have children, what's my fault? Has she lost her mind?
Such a stupid thing to say! She is an educated woman,
yet she is talking like illiterate people. You should've told her
what the gynecologist has said. That you're perfectly fine,
there's nothing wrong with you. It's just stress, and God is willing, when
you are happy, the good news will come. By the way, Rameen... I've told you many times
that our problems are not your problems! You take everything to your heart,
upon your mind. That's why you have so much tension.
She's right. She also keeps saying that I take
tensions from here home with me. She says in the last two years, I haven't been
able to give Shahzar any happiness. Plus, she's adding more pressure on my head
that we want a grandson! Our heir.  is that something to say? And she’s creating a conflict between me
and Shahzar. That no, Shahzar wants children,
but he doesn't say anything to me because I fight with him. So show it to Shahzar,
you have the evidence. Show him the gynecologist's report
that see, I'm not lying. I mean, you're perfect.  Tell him to go
and get tested. Amma, what are you saying? I mean, they want an heir, right?
You're perfectly fine, 100% normal. So maybe he has a problem.
She should take her son and get him tested. Seriously, Mama? You know very well that my relationship
with Shahzar is already very risky. He's looking for an excuse to fight with
me, and now you're creating more problems. But all I'm saying is that they want
an heir, a son, and since you're not expecting,
they're saying-- R... Rameen!  Rameen, I didn't mean to like
that! -Oh!
- Rameen, I didn't mean it... Our daughter is here today.  See! Parents already know.  They can smell
their daughters from a mile away! I knew you'd be coming today, that's why I
brought your favorite cheesecake. We'll sit together, have tea, eat cake,
and talk! - Rameen!
-What? I... I'll come and tell you.  Rameen!
Dear! Rameen, please! Don't beat me around the bush.
Come to the point! I can help you in catching Kamran. But on one condition. Doctors are saying
there is no point in getting her treatment. But still, if you insist, we can... The treatment they'll do now
is very expensive. You'll get your money tomorrow. I am not doing this in greed
for money, Khala. then what do you want? Shahzar.
