[19.01] I’m really sorry to say this,
I didn't want to, but I have to.
[23.82] You are an extremely self-centered,
ungrateful, and selfish person.
[28.57] That's why I've made a decision.
[29.93] As soon as the morning comes,
I’m leaving this house.
[32.04] Dear, forget about this guy.
[34.86] We've already fixed your engagement
with Arshad, Mr. Mazoor's son.
[38.75] They’re coming in two days
for the formal engagement.
[45.78] Baba, why are you doing this to me?
[49.49] First, you rejected Shahzar's proposal,
[52.06] and then when he came
to your office to talk to you,
[54.02] you insulted him and threw him out.
[56.01] You had every right to reject him,
but who gave you the right to insult him?
[61.79] Lower your voice and speak.
Don’t forget that I am your father.
[66.81] You are forcing me.
[68.86] He left his home for my sake,
and look at how you are treating him.
[79.00] What should I do and what I should not do,
you don’t need to explain that to me.
[87.08] His father is not happy with this proposal,
[90.09] how can I send you to a house
where you will be the reason for stress?
[94.07] Why can’t you understand this?
[96.22] Apart from the boy,
[97.51] whoever you tell, whenever you tell,
I will get you married to them--
[99.70] No, no, no, no!
[101.35] You're not rejecting this proposal
because of his parents;
[104.72] you're rejecting it because you want
me to marry someone richer than him.
[108.79] - Rameen!
- Stop it!
[110.83] I’m very disappointed.
[112.66] I could never have imagined that my father
could be this selfish and materialistic.
[117.37] You are choosing money
over your daughter’s happiness.
[120.41] - Ram--
- What’s wrong with Shahzar?
[122.79] What does he lack?
[125.44] People are right about him.
[127.25] He doesn't see anything beyond money.
[130.50] Every has always told me
that he married you for money.
[134.99] Shut up, Rameen! Be quiet!
[145.35] You’re not even ashamed, are you?
[154.95] How dare-- How dare you talk
about your father--
[160.56] - How dare you--
- Mehru!
[162.30] - How dare you--
- Enough.
[165.30] - How dare-- Dare--
- Come, come with me.
[168.76] How can she even think like that?
[172.26] That's it.
[174.42] Did you take your medicine?
[192.14] I'm sorry, Mehru.
[194.83] I'm extremely sorry.
[196.94] In these 22 years,
I could never give you any happiness.
[202.61] I'm not just a failed businessman, but...
[207.41] I'm also failed husband
and a failed father.
[212.28] Please.
[214.14] Please don't embarrass me
by saying this like these.
[217.94] I am one who's ashamed of myself...
[221.70] ashamed in front of you,
ashamed in front of my daughter.
[225.53] Didn't you see?
[229.56] She said the same thing
that people have always said about me.
[232.73] It’s people’s job to talk nonsense.
[236.58] The whole world knows that
[238.05] for the past 20 years, you invested all
the business profits into my treatment.
[245.74] If they still say these things, so...
[249.32] let them.
[252.60] I had complete trust in you then
and I have complete trust in you now.
[258.69] Today, I have felt the
failure of mine very intensely.
[263.11] Today I found out that success
is measured through wealth.
[268.83] in status, in honor.
[272.25] What did I achieve?
[278.67] I think of myself...
[281.29] as the luckiest woman in the world.
[286.06] Don’t talk like this, it disturbs me.
[297.55] Drink water.
[310.00] So...
[312.18] Don't even wait for tomorrow,
just stop worrying from today.
[319.08] You rest.
[344.00] Bhai! You're back. Mom? Mom!
[348.23] Mom, see! Bhai is back. Phuppo!
[350.94] - Phuppo, Bhai is back!
- He's back? Shahzar?
[355.12] You're back?
[357.20] Thank God!
[358.86] You're back otherwise your mother and I
were going to bring you back.
[363.98] - The house was empty without you.
- I was really missing you.
[367.71] - There was no one here to bother me.
- Shahzar!
[373.03] I'm so glad you're back.
[374.52] You did the right thing by coming back.
We... we were all so worried.
[401.25] It's okay.
[402.86] Everything's fine.
[404.75] It's good that you're back.
[407.07] Rest now.
[441.26] They will be here in a little while.
[444.09] Get ready and come down.
[447.00] You will meet them properly,
[449.49] and in your conversation, you will not
show any involvement with anyone else.
[487.72] When I first saw your son,
I liked him immediately.
[492.24] We also saw Rameen's photo and decided
that she was the right one for Arshad.
[496.83] If they meet and talk,
I don’t foresee any issues with that.
[502.28] Yes, I think it's very important.
[506.12] Before getting married,
[507.67] the man and woman should spend time
together to build mutual understanding.
[512.50] I could hardly resist the urge to bring
the engagement ring with me today.
[517.30] This engagement and the ring,
they are just formalities,
[519.95] but the important thing is this:
you just think that Rameen is yours.
[525.06] Now this calls for a sweet treat!
[528.03] - Sure, why not!
- I'll get the sweets.
[529.77] Yes.
[530.74] - I don't see Rameen anywhere.
- What happened--
[532.90] I’ll call her.
[535.78] You should've brought your son along too. 
It would've been good if the kids to met.
[538.84] Madam!
[541.02] - Something terrible has happened.
- What’s happened?
[542.72] - Rameen...
- What’s happened to Rameen?
[545.59] - Tell me!
- What happened?
[546.63] - Why aren't you saying anything?
- Sir...
[548.07] Miss Rameen is unconscious in her room.
[550.21] - Quickly  go and check on her!  
- Move!
[556.84] Rameen!
[558.03] - Rameen! Rameen?
- Child?
[562.85] Rameen!
[565.04] - Ra-- Rameen!
- Quickly call the ambulance.
[567.36] - Rameen!
- Rameen! Easy, easy. God!
[571.98] Ra-- Rameen.
[587.80] Yes?
[593.96] I have some news about Umar Hassan
and his family.
[602.46] What? What kind of news?
[604.27] Yes...
[606.43] His daughter has attempted suicide, 
and she's at the hospital right now.
[612.43] - Really?
- Yes.
[614.57] My informer said Umar Hassan was trying to
arrange her marriage without her consent.
[620.56] And all of this happened in reaction 
to that.
[624.13] - How's her condition?
- Very bad.
[627.02] Her condition is very critical. 
I don’t think she will survive.
[633.51] Where is the hospital?
[649.07] Doctor.
[651.34] Doctor, my child.
[652.89] - What... what has happened to her? 
- Look, this is a suicide case,
[656.90] and in such cases, we have to inform 
the police for a proper investigation.
[663.22] But since your daughter’s condition is
critical, we started the treatment.
[668.50] Ger stomach is being washed,
and generally, it takes some time.
[672.43] If she regains consciousness by morning, 
she will survive. Otherwise…
[675.77] Otherwise?
[678.10] Look, we are doing everything we can,
[680.66] but mentally, you need to be prepared 
for any news.
[684.61] No, Doctor...
[686.94] - That's it, that's it.
- My daughter...
[689.88] That's it.
[691.00] Nothing will happen. 
Our daughter will be fine. I am sure of it.
[694.73] Everything will be fine, God willing.
[697.79] That's it, sweetheart, that's it.
[699.22] Yes, tell me, what's the latest news 
from the hospital?
[701.74] The doctors are washing her stomach now,
they are trying their best to save her.
[706.60] Okay, do one thing:
[708.23] leak this news to all the newspapers,
the press, and all the bloggers.
[714.93] It’s a difficult task
you've asked me to do.
[717.82] Because you know that Umar
Hassan is a very influential man,
[722.06] and he will try to suppress this
using his contacts.
[726.91] If you say yes, I will try to
spread this news within his family.
[734.21] Just do what I tell you.
[736.42] Don’t worry about who knows whom.
Understand?
[741.32] I want this news on the TV!
[743.29] And once the news leaks, it's hard to stop.
Just do as I say.
[748.55] - Okay, all right.
- Thank you.
[765.54] This is all because of you.
[768.58] My daughter was forced into this
situation because of your stubbornness.
[772.91] If anything happens to her...
[775.54] I will never forgive you.
[782.00] Get ahold of yourself, Mehru.
[784.71] I'm sorry.
[787.73] I never imagined that my daughter...
[791.25] could go this far for that boy.
[795.98] Our Rameen was so full of life.
[802.15] She loved her life.
[805.75] How could she end her life like this?
[808.83] How?
[813.82] How could she do this?
[816.98] Didn’t she think 
about what it would do to us?
[820.42] What pain will her parents go through?
[824.58] Umar, go. Go and talk to the doctor
to do everything to save our daughter.
[829.26] I'll die if something happened 
to her, Umar.
[832.03] - Go, go!
- Okay.
[834.38] Tell him...
[839.73] What happened, doctor?
[841.01] The doctors have done the stomach wash,
[843.30] and, God willing, she will regain
consciousness in a few hours.
[845.62] - Thank God!
- She is out of danger now.
[848.95] and we should be able to discharge her
by tomorrow.
[854.77] Mr. Umar, I need to talk to you 
about something important.
[858.24] Yes, go ahead.
[859.53] Look, I’ve done my best to keep this
from reaching the press or the police,
[864.66] but someone from the hospital
management leaked the information.
[872.48] The press will be here in a few minutes.
They will talk to you and your wife.
[882.91] Press?
[884.36] - Yes.
- Look, doctor, please do something.
[887.60] You know how much I trust
you and your hospital,
[890.33] which is why I brought my daughter
here. Please do something.
[893.67] I’ve tried my best, but sometimes, 
situations are beyond our control.
[899.62] I understand your grief, Mr. Umar,
but unfortunately,
[903.57] I cannot help you any further.
[907.37] You’ll have to handle the press yourself.
[912.93] Umar, you have many contacts,
ask someone you know for help--
[921.93] Sit.
[925.09] What do you think....
[927.27] I didn’t do all that?
[930.42] But...
[932.49] what can I do?
[936.24] We'll be dishonored.
[939.90] I understand.
[952.22] You've done another foolish thing!
[954.98] I told you to check with your mother 
before taking such a step!
[961.65] Oh, I thought you would be happy, 
but you’re getting angry.
[965.62] You're asking for trouble,
that's what you're doing.
[969.34] You've a brilliant mind. You're smart
and intelligent but no.
[974.11] You’ve made a mess of everything yourself.
[977.86] Shahzar finally came home,
[980.42] and now after hearing about that girl,
he will run away and never come back.
[985.91] You’re right. I didn’t think
about it like that, but anyway...
[990.47] It’s not too late. 
You can still stop your manager.
[994.41] What will you get 
by ruining Umar Hassan’s name?
[997.05] It'll give me peace and happiness.
[999.44] I want him to be disgraced. 
I want his whole family to be ruined,
[1003.65] so much that he won’t be able
to show his face to anyone.
[1005.65] He will be so humiliated that he will have
no choice but to leave not only the city
[1007.27] but the entire country. That’s what I want.
[1010.27] The rest of Shahzar's problems can wait.
Nothing will happen.
[1014.09] His daughter is struggling 
between life and death,
[1017.73] and that is punishment enough for him.
[1021.52] And yes.
[1023.31] Don’t do anything rash
just to comfort your heart.
[1031.99] Tell me, why did your daughter 
attempt suicide?
[1037.45] I don’t know. What can I say? 
She’s a child...
[1042.93] What if she had some disagreements
with your or your wife?
[1047.63] No, no. What are you saying? How
can children disagree with their parents?
[1052.26] Just understand that we never
expected her to take such an extreme step.
[1057.78] Everything seemed fine.
[1072.43] If everything was fine, why did she
feel the need to take such a drastic step?
[1080.00] I heard that on the day of the incident,
[1083.49] some people came to your house 
to discuss the proposal.
[1086.46] Yes, right.
[1087.86] Is it possible that your
daughter liked someone else, and...
[1092.11] you were forcing her 
into a marriage with someone else?
[1096.47] No, no. We are not the kind of parents.
We--
[1100.82] Please forgive us. In such cases, 
this kind of thing happens.
[1108.37] All right, what exactly are you trying 
to ask?
[1112.76] Look, suicide is a criminal offense,
[1116.14] and anyone who attempts it, 
they're punished,
[1119.87] so they think carefully before doing it.
[1125.39] For now, I am not filing
an FIR under suicide against your daughter,
[1131.74] but once she regains consciousness, please
inform me so I can take her statement.
[1138.54] Yes, yes, we will. Thank you very much.
[1142.57] Thank you.
[1161.82] - Excuse me, sir.
- Excuse me, sir.
[1163.13] Are you the father of Rameen Hassan,
admitted in room number 101?
[1165.30] - Who are you? 
- This is Mr. Umar Hassan, take a picture.
[1167.55] One minute.
[1168.59] What’s your problem? 
There's no need to take a picture.
[1170.94] We've reports that tour daughter 
attempted suicide,
[1173.40] We've come to take your and your
daughter's statement regarding this matter.
[1175.36] Look, whatever you've heard-- Listen to me.
[1177.15] Whatever you've heard is wrong.
There's nothing like that!
[1179.54] - No comments! 
- Sir, please! Please!
[1181.20] - I don't have any comments.
- Sir? But sir? Sir!
[1184.06] -  I don't have any comments.
- Sir, please! Sir! Sir! Sir!
[1186.56] - Sir! Sir, tell us something.
- Please, sir. Please! Sir! Sir!
[1209.31] This was the father of Rameen Hassan, 
Umar Hassan,
[1210.97] whose daughter has just attempted suicide.
[1213.13] We tried to speak to them, 
but he preferred not to respond.
[1216.39] Now, what is the truth and what
is the lie, we'll keep you updated.
[1219.16] Stay tuned to XYZ News.
[1236.74] What do you think, sweetheart? I didn't
try to explain, I didn't talk to him?
[1240.86] - He's not listening. 
- I knew you'd say this.
[1244.62] You spent your entire life with
your head bowed in front of Baba.
[1247.73] You never took a stand for me.
[1255.34] Give me some time, I'll talk again, 
I promise you.
[1259.43] You won't do anything now 
because you can't do anything.
[1262.63] Whatever I do now, I will do it myself.
[1328.30] We have reports that your daughter
tried to commit suicide.
[1331.02] We wanted to take your and your
daughter's statements regarding this.
[1333.00] Whatever you've heard-- Listen to me.
Whatever you've heard is wrong.
[1335.91] - There's nothing like that.
- Sir-- Sir?
[1337.14] - I don't want to talk about this matter.
- Sir? Sir?
[1340.72] - Sir, wait. Sir?
- Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir!
[1349.46] Who ran this news on TV, Mom?
[1352.84] Who else would do it?
[1354.06] These media people are
always after spicy stories.
[1357.18] They show up everywhere with a microphone.
[1358.61] But in the city, hundreds of incidents 
happen every day.
[1361.42] Why don't they go there with their mics?
[1364.58] Shahzar is right. 
It’s all a conspiracy to defame us.
[1368.94] Umar Hassan isn't famous enough for
the media to cover his family's news.
[1375.18] Our name is being tarnished
along with Rameen's family.
[1379.19] Let's see what kind of rumors
people will start spreading now.
[1382.81] This girl attempted suicide 
only for Shahzar's sake.
[1388.04] I can't believe this.
[1390.33] That girl is right now struggling 
between life and death,
[1394.15] and you’re only concerned about your name?
[1396.08] Wealth, status, and name
are built with difficulty,
[1399.79]  but it doesn’t take long to ruin them.
[1403.36] Let’s see how people point fingers.
[1406.13] This girl did it because of us!
[1409.04] Not because of us. 
She did it because of you.
[1413.00] You know very well that
everything happened because of you.
[1415.27] If you had agreed, Rameen
would never have taken that step.
[1422.71] Anyway, I... I'm going.
[1426.06] - Where are you going?
- Hospital.
[1430.29] Are you in your senses?
[1431.65] I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to Mom.
[1434.90] - Mom, please go with him. 
- How can I go?
[1439.16] She’s in a critical condition.
[1441.12] Fine. You don’t go then. I'll go myself.
[1444.31] How can you go there in this situation?
[1446.53] If you go, the media will come there, and
they’ll try to destroy our family’s name.
[1450.74] I’ve told you, I don’t want to argue 
with you, Dad!
[1454.23] Enough is enough. I'm going
and no one can stop me.
[1457.30] Fine, I’m going with you.
[1461.56] Fine, you get ready. 
I'll go get dressed too.
[1480.43] Your daughter has regained consciousness. 
Thank God, the danger has passed.
[1484.48] You can meet her now, but remember,
[1487.95] don’t say anything that might put
any mental pressure on her.
[1490.78] - Okay.
- All right? Okay.
[1492.12] Thank you.
[1536.02] How are you feeling?
[1543.48] Rameen, I know you’re very angry with me,
[1547.40] and you have every right to be angry. 
But what was I supposed to do, man?
[1553.69] I can fight my dad 
and convince him any other way.
[1559.12] But the things your dad said...
[1562.73] I thought I wouldn’t be able 
to convince him.
[1565.52] That's why I got tired 
and was disappointed.
[1578.75] I had an idea that you were mad,
[1580.63] but I didn’t think you were so crazy
that you would risk your life like this.
[1587.49] Do you realize what would have
happened if something had happened to you?
[1594.84] What would I have done? 
What would I have done?
[1601.68] Thank God you’re fine.
[1606.33] Don’t make such a face,
fix your expression.
[1620.37] It’s already midnight...
[1623.59] and we still haven’t
heard anything about them.
[1626.22] I have all kinds of doubts in my heart.
[1629.24] What if that girl dies? If she does, 
it’ll be a whole mess for us.
[1635.66] Phuppo, I've been trying for so long.
[1637.19] Mom's number is not connecting, 
and neither is Bhai's.
[1639.34] It might be a network problem.
Please, keep trying.
[1645.58] Aapa, pray that she survives.
[1649.65] Otherwise, Shahzar will hold me responsible
for her death. He will never forgive me.
[1655.25] If something happened to that girl...
[1660.11] there could be a police case as well.
[1662.80] - I have a reputation in this city.
- What kind of a person are you?
[1670.14] The girl is in the hospital, and you’re
only concerned about your reputation.
[1677.53] - Phuppo, pray that Rameen survives. 
- God willing, God willing, let’s hope.
[1688.83] Hello, hello, Bhai? Is Rameen okay?
[1694.23] Thank God! Rameen's fine.
[1697.69] - She has regained consciousness. 
- Thank God.
[1701.42] Okay, Bhai, please keep me updated.
Goodbye!
[1706.30] - Thank God she survived!
- Thank God.
[1747.61] Did they leave?
[1750.21] They just left a while ago.
[1753.60] You must be tired.
[1755.51] I'll stay with Rameen.
[1757.76] You should go home and rest.
[1760.49] You need rest more than I do.
[1763.81] You go home, rest,
[1767.65] and I’ll get her discharged in the morning
and bring her home.
[1770.53] What were you talking
to Shahzar’s mom about?
[1778.12] You were talking to her
in the corridor for so long,
[1779.93] I thought maybe you were talking
about Rameen and Shahzar's marriage.
[1784.29] Come on! Is this the time 
to talk about marriage?
[1792.17] Umar, I think you should stop being 
so stubborn now.
[1796.45] Seriously think about their marriage.
[1805.83] You're right.
[1809.32] Whatever decision I make now...
[1813.89] I'll make it with Rameen's consent.
[1818.67] So, what were you talking 
to Shahzar’s mom about?
[1829.17] Nothing special. Just...
[1831.55] discussing not having a police case filed.
[1834.65] She used her contacts to sort that out.
[1838.45] You also have a lot of connections. 
within the police.
[1841.72] I did.
[1844.70] You know, Mehru, when a person falls 
from the sky to the ground...
[1849.78] many of their people leave them.
[1853.89] Yesterday, the people who were proud 
to stand by me...
[1858.98] they don’t even want to talk to me today.
[1861.19] Our situation isn’t that bad.
[1865.35] What did Mr. Manzoor say? 
Did he contact you?
[1868.40] Yes, he called.
[1873.63] He insulted me very badly.
[1877.17] He said, "If you knew 
what your daughter wanted,
[1879.64] then why bother with a relationship 
with my son?"
[1885.17] I wanted the ground to open up 
and swallow me.
[1895.02] You know, when someone falls...
[1899.39] instead of helping, 
people kick them further down...
[1903.65] so they don’t have the strength 
to get back up.
[1907.75] Right now, that’s what people are doing 
to us.
[1911.91] But we won’t fall any further.
[1915.35] Patience, courage.
[1919.31] You have to stand up again, for yourself.
[1922.71] I'm with you.
[1929.71] I know.
[1932.30] - I know you're with me.
- Always!
[1943.80] Thank God the girl survived...
[1947.05] otherwise my son would have made sure 
I was humiliated.
[1950.91] Shahnawaz, why are you blaming Shahzar?
[1955.70] Whenever anything happens,
[1958.50] a fight starts, and accusations fly.
[1962.63] Thank God her life was saved. 
Don’t let this case escalate.
[1967.21] Shahzar spent the whole night 
at the hospital.
[1970.40] This means there’s still some soft corner
in his heart for that girl.
[1975.31] It's love, Shahnawaz.
[1977.21] It'll take some time to move on.
[1978.95] I think Shahzar will insist 
on marrying her again.
[1986.08] his time, you won’t oppose him.
[1990.06] As a sister, I order you 
to let Shahzar marry whoever he wants.
[1995.95] Otherwise, you’ll regret it 
for the rest of your life.
[1998.56] If he took a step like Rameen did, 
you’ll be left with nothing.
[2003.53] - He’s your only child. 
- That’s true, but...
[2008.08] what about the family? 
How will I face them?
[2011.91] I don’t understand...
[2016.17] I don’t understand why you’re
discussing this for so long.
[2020.63] I want to marry Rameen, not her father.
[2023.91] I am content to know 
that she’s an honorable girl.
[2027.53] So don’t worry, no one will
harm your family’s honor.
[2065.57] You think you’re very clever.
[2068.68] What were you thinking?
That by turning Shahnawaz against Umar,
[2072.45] you’ll save Shahzar’s life 
from those people?
[2075.92] That’s a big mistake.
[2077.66] Shahzar is very firm in his words 
and intentions.
[2080.95] He will never change his decision.
[2084.55] I’m already very worried. 
Don’t make things worse.
[2087.62] I don’t want to trouble you.
[2090.26] I’m just trying to warn you 
about the impending storm.
[2093.46] I just want to tell you 
all your plans have failed.
[2097.65] The situation is getting heated,
[2099.68] and now Arfa is trying 
to convince her brother.
[2103.97] And you know it very well that the
brother never goes against his sister.
[2109.11] What do you want me to do?
[2110.39] Should I give up and bring Umar’s daughter
into our house as my daughter-in-law?
[2113.62] There’s no other choice.
[2115.77] If Shahnawaz has agreed, 
you will have to respect his decision,
[2120.41] or Shahzar will get away from you,
[2123.01] and all your wealth and status 
will slip through your fingers.
[2127.73] This isn’t about status or honor.
[2131.34] The person who betrayed me, 
who broke my heart,
[2135.33] who was unfaithful to me, 
who ruined my life...
[2139.48] how will I be to see his daughter happy
and settled in my home?
[2144.60] This is human nature.
[2146.66] I know you’ve been burning 
with the fire of revenge for years, dear.
[2151.07] And you won't get a better chance than this
to get your revenge.
[2155.68] What do you mean?
[2157.18] There is no better way to punish a greedy,
deceitful, and unfaithful person than this.
[2163.18] Make his daughter as your daughter-in-law 
and make her suffer.
[2168.80] I bet you this.
[2170.75] To get his daughter married,
[2172.94] he will come to you himself. he'll beg you,
and plead with you. He'll be on his knees!
[2180.79] You'll see.
