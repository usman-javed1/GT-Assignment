[1.75] [Music]
[7.08] My heart is filled with sorrow I lost
[12.44] my mother in my husband's house
[16.76] and if any of you
[20.84] tries to come there or try to make contact with me,
[22.84] I will leave my husband's house. Have
[25.52] you locked yourself in your room?
[30.60] Get out of that room, what will I
[36.84] do by getting out? Continue your studies,
[41.44] meet your friends. What will happen by staying locked in the room like this?
[44.76] Nothing will change. Get out and
[48.60] face the world.
[50.00] I cannot face the questions of the world.
[52.88] You go away, leave me to my mercy and
[56.32] what will happen by crying and wailing.
[60.40] See, time does not
[64.16] remain the same. Gather some courage
[67.24] Manal,
[71.04] get out. You are not the first girl
[73.76] with whom all this has happened. A
[76.40] lot more happens in life, one has to
[80.16] endure a lot.
[83.44] You have not seen the world yet. I
[87.12] thought you were very brave, I
[92.96] know you are not a coward. [
[94.90] Music] You wo
[97.48] n't
[100.68] listen to me, don't you trust me? Come on, well
[105.64] done, let's go out. I will make you do a lot of
[108.92] shopping.
[110.43] [Music]
[113.04] Yes, meet a friend.  It is
[116.36] okay, whatever your heart desires, tell me
[120.64] what you want to do, okay, come
[122.60] on a long drive with me, we will
[123.96] listen to songs, we will go on a long drive,
[128.20] then we will have something to eat and then we will not
[130.88] hear any denial, come on, let's go, well done
[135.28] [music]
[140.48] go,
[143.64] who got this contract done?
[146.88] Hell, I am responsible for you,
[150.76] sir, your most favourite and trusted uniform
[152.76] employee, Mr. Hasan sahab. He had
[155.44] given the contract to this company and
[156.88] he has also collected the commission of crores.
[160.32] Sir, please
[163.40] see this signature. This is the same
[167.04] contract in which
[169.12] we had discussed the commission with Umar sahab, but sir, the issue is that the
[172.28] amount of two crores has been given to him
[174.60] in the form of cash instead of a cheque. Otherwise, I will
[176.76] bring all the transactions from the bank and show them to you.
[183.52] Okay, yes, please send this to Umar sahab,
[188.48] foreign please, thank you, it's
[195.16] unbelievable
[202.48] nonsense, salam,
[205.52] sir, sir, you
[208.00] called me, I called you,
[212.08] what have you done, what kind of a game is this?
[224.08] You have signed this, sir, I have signed this, but the
[227.24] terms that you are seeing on the last page are
[229.40] not my terms.  I signed it,
[232.08] you are lying, your signature is present in it and you have taken
[235.28] commission, the question
[238.64] arises that what is the purpose of this, sir, I did not take
[242.04] any commission,
[244.28] why don't you tell
[245.76] them that you did not take commission, there is proof of everything
[250.56] here, why are you
[255.36] standing here looking at me, take
[258.48] this, you want to
[260.64] destroy my company
[268.63] [Sangeet] I do
[272.48] n't understand, despite being so educated and from the
[275.48] city, you did such a thing,
[278.76] but sir, I did not sign it,
[281.96] either this signature is fake or this
[285.52] term is not the one which I had decided with them and
[288.20] sir, your signature is mentioned,
[291.96] I signed it on your insistence only [
[317.31] Sangeet]
[323.13] [Sangeet]
[337.24] I have thought of something for you
[339.85] [Sangeet]
[352.38] [Sangeet]
[362.72] Just be careful, while trapping him, you yourself should
[366.48] not get into any problem, no one should have
[368.80] any kind of good luck,
[370.76] oh madam, don't worry at all,
[374.24] I got him to sign very cleverly
[376.80] and got
[380.40] a letter prepared by giving 2 lakh rupees to the trap manager of this contract, which will come to
[383.00] know about it  That Umar Hasan sahab has been
[388.36] taking illegal commission on every cash collection of the order, so why be afraid,
[390.84] I will talk to you later,
[394.48] okay, who are you talking to,
[397.96] how did you come to my room without informing me? Yes, I am asking,
[400.36] whom are you talking to and with whom are you
[402.08] playing this love game with me, you
[403.96] mean you should mind your own business here,
[405.96] you mean what have I done wrong to
[407.76] you, why are you doing all this to me, do
[410.36] n't tell me in a straightforward manner, I know how to lose
[412.84] from here, sir, tell me why are you doing this to
[415.52] me, I just pushed the
[416.92] security guards, oh security,
[419.24] you have been terminated from here,
[421.48] what does terminated mean, you will cheat
[423.12] me, push him
[424.48] out of here, he is cheating, he is cheating, he has cheated
[427.56] me in connivance with someone,
[429.40] oh leave it, leave it, why don't you let me go
[432.75] [Music], did he not come to
[440.88] know anything, did he not come to know
[444.48] that all this is happening at my behest,
[446.44] oh no ma'am, you did
[448.48] not know anything about you,
[451.04] but I have been trapped very badly  I have said that
[453.72] until he is not arrested, he will
[456.36] come here again and again and will keep blackmailing me and while
[458.92] leaving he was saying that I will
[461.60] take you to the court and nothing will happen to the one who is involved in the plan.
[464.80] He has no
[467.60] proof against you
[469.20] nor any solid proof, how will he prove it in the court
[472.88] and the lawyer cannot do that.
[476.40] Now be careful,
[480.16] we cannot afford such blunders.
[482.19] [Sangeet]
[489.11] [Sangeet]
[501.16] and by giving â‚¹ lakh to the manager of this cant, I have got
[505.44] a letter prepared from which it will be
[507.64] known that Kimar Hasan sahab has been
[510.52] taking illegal commission on every cash recovery of the order. If I
[517.40] were in your place, I would have got him arrested immediately.
[523.88] I told him that your daughter is a
[528.56] fool but I never expected this from you.
[534.12] Instead of getting him arrested,
[538.64] sitting and apologizing,
[543.88] where is he? Tell me his address and
[548.08] where is Shajar. Tell Shajar to get him arrested today and right now.
[550.96] Listen to me, do
[554.56] n't evolve the police, it will be of no use to them,
[558.04] anyway they are not going to be affected by everything.  etc. he has
[560.84] returned the money, if we involve the police then it will
[564.32] only bring disrepute,
[569.80] you try to understand, now he is just
[572.80] falling at your feet and asking for the mafia, how did he even think
[576.00] that we will forgive him and
[579.92] why are you speaking in his support, did
[583.16] you forget that when he left our daughter on the wedding night and went away,
[586.12] we should trust him again, you are right, I
[590.16] cannot forget, I cannot forget in a moment,
[594.64] maybe for the sake of my mind we will have to swallow this bitter
[597.64] pill
[600.44] and he is really apologizing a lot, if the one who forgot in
[605.44] the morning comes home in the evening, then he is
[608.32] not called forgotten,
[611.16] beware, beware, if anyone utters even one word in his name,
[614.68] he is my daughter's culprit and this is a
[619.04] matter of my daughter's life
[622.52] and there must be some reason behind him returning the money and jewellery, he must have
[629.64] thought of something new,
[631.12] tell him, tell him to divorce my daughter
[635.16] and quietly go out of her life,
[639.08] I will talk to my lawyer tomorrow itself and will
[642.24] send him a khula notice and will get him arrested
[647.17] [Music]
[654.60] you are lying, your signature is present in it and the
[657.32] commission is also there  You have asked me the question is
[662.08] what is the purpose of this
[665.72] now are you looking at my face you want to see
[669.84] my
[673.96] [Sangeet]
[680.84] company you didn't do any shopping I did
[684.72] n't feel like doing it anyway I didn't like anything ok let's
[686.80] eat something
[689.84] I'm feeling hungry
[692.84] let's chair up it's okay come
[713.08] here
[722.80] [Sangeet]
[738.52] I have full doubt that guy
[741.03] [Sangeet] she is a
[742.76] very clever woman I never
[751.32] thought that she would stoop so low in her enmity what has she done
[758.52] you try to prove yourself innocent by any means
[764.16] otherwise you can be punished
[767.45] [Sangeet] so it
[770.12] seems you will be punished the
[774.76] police can arrest me at any time
[782.76] how cleverly she got me to sign wrong signatures
[787.64] and the company with which I had signed the
[790.28] contract
[793.24] she also got the finance manager of that company with her
[801.64] how but
[804.04] son how do you get yourself out of this quagmire
[809.05] [Sangeet]
[811.76] keep up your courage
[813.48] son you are not alone I am with you
[817.52] we will talk to a lawyer
[821.64] ah I don't have thousands and
[824.60] lakhs of rupees to pay lawyers
[828.00] now  It seems
[831.48] as if jail is my fate,
[835.28] keep up your courage my child, I
[839.24] cannot let you break down like this,
[842.72] this test,
[845.36] Allah puts his special people through such tests
[849.02] [Music]
[850.40] Allah will make everything better,
[853.88] you just pray, Allah will make everything better
[857.41] [Music]
[863.16] ok, tell me what to
[866.04] eat, I don't have anything to eat, you order for yourself,
[868.48] I don't want anything to go wrong
[887.38] [Music]
[911.60] Manol, how dare you, leave from here right now, I did not
[917.88] hear anything you said, please tell me
[921.56] one thing, go from here and hand him over to the police,
[923.88] listen to me, after that whatever punishment
[925.88] you can give, I did not listen to
[927.80] anything you said, just go, what is happening, mom,
[931.40] mom, tell him to go from here right now,
[933.72] hand him over to the police, just tell him to leave,
[936.68] listen to him, I had called him,
[943.80] please Anaal,
[946.72] Manal, listen to me
[950.04] [Music] [
[960.57] Music] what
[973.32] kind of doubt do
[975.20] you have, yes,
[977.60] our finance manager Rizwan sahab works with me in the office,
[983.28] a few months ago, he gave me some files and got
[986.52] me to sign, in a hurry,
[988.48] I had to go to the hospital, my wife's  I was
[990.92] very unwell and was
[993.60] in a hurry, so I could not read those papers.
[996.20] I think Rizwan sahab, who you
[1000.12] suspect, has been
[1001.68] framed badly.
[1004.56] All the evidence is going against you,
[1007.60] but tell me how did you suspect him?
[1010.96] Actually, I heard him talking to someone on the phone,
[1014.40] very clearly. The
[1017.16] court does not believe hearsay. The
[1019.56] court needs solid evidence and I will
[1022.92] try, but in this regard, you
[1025.52] too will have to be very careful. Well, tell me, there is no
[1028.96] resentment, any
[1032.16] animosity or professional jealousy between you two. There
[1035.36] cannot be professional jealousy because
[1038.32] we had different jobs,
[1040.80] but I am sure that
[1045.04] Rizwan sahab did all this to me at the behest of someone.
[1047.24] Who could it be? That
[1050.00] man is the
[1051.64] chairman of Malik Shahnawaz Group.
[1059.96] He is a very famous name in the business
[1063.04] world. There is no animosity or any animosity between you two.
[1067.04] Look, there is no animosity,
[1070.60] but some time back, I was engaged to him and he was engaged to me,
[1075.56] but intentionally we could not continue
[1079.72] and after that, for so many years, he
[1083.12] never told me anything.  I did not meet her, now suddenly she came back in my life like this
[1086.44] and then after a long time I
[1089.12] saw her, I think she
[1095.40] wants to take some revenge from me for that time, listen to me, listen Manal, I will
[1099.32] not go anywhere with you in future,
[1101.48] try to understand me, listen to me,
[1103.48] why did you take me to meet Kamran,
[1105.52] why should I forgive him, what kind of a mother are you, you do not
[1107.68] value your daughter's passion, you are
[1109.88] misunderstanding, mom, just leave it to me
[1116.97] [Music]
[1126.60] listen, what has the lawyer said, he will fight your case,
[1132.76] Ami, he did not refuse to
[1135.60] fight the case, but Ami, I do
[1137.44] not have anything to give him,
[1140.52] it is a blessing, it is his great kindness that
[1142.56] he agreed to fight this case without any old connection, I
[1146.80] cannot understand where he has trapped
[1150.56] me, I do not have any proof against that Rizwan
[1155.28] and dragging Tab in this case means
[1159.40] that my daughter's home will be ruined,
[1161.96] she will never let her home settle down, that
[1166.04] woman will soon come down on high
[1169.36] before this  You bring Ramin here,
[1171.68] I am thinking that I should back out from
[1175.76] this case, if they
[1178.44] misunderstand you then who is going to think me right,
[1181.48] everyone is misunderstanding me, at least my daughter's house will be
[1183.92] saved, not mine, you are innocent, you have to
[1188.68] prove yourself innocent,
[1190.92] face the difficulties bravely,
[1195.56] I am with you, you
[1197.76] need not be afraid of anyone,
[1199.96] I am trying, but I cannot
[1202.24] give anything else to my daughter, at least I
[1205.16] can save her house from getting destroyed,
[1208.68] I have never seen you so sad before,
[1212.60] what should I
[1215.00] do, on one hand there is this case and on the other hand how should I let my daughter's
[1218.92] house get destroyed,
[1224.52] she should make such strong evidence against me, I get
[1228.76] surprised, sometimes see
[1230.27] [Sangeet]'
[1232.16] s barrister was saying that the chances of my case getting dismissed are
[1236.04] very less, he also has no hope,
[1238.88] Allah will get it
[1240.96] out, he will make it better, of course Allah will make it better,
[1245.76] Ila
[1267.82] [Sangeet]
[1275.27] [Sangeet]
[1283.60] what is the issue with you, why did you call
[1286.04] me Minal, please do not hang up without listening to me completely, I am
[1289.60] requesting,
[1292.64] what do you want to say to you, I agree that there is
[1297.36] greed  I did a very bad thing when I came here
[1300.64] but now I have realized my mistakes
[1303.92] I have realized that I
[1306.68] truly love you Hey, if there was no love then I would
[1309.12] not have come back and I would
[1311.84] not have returned all the things to your mother
[1315.92] Now what do you want from me, an
[1323.48] apology I have forgiven you but do not
[1327.48] call me in future nor follow me If
[1330.04] you are seen around me then I will
[1331.92] complain to the police Please please do
[1335.24] not hang up My talk is not over yet
[1342.16] Minal I do not want an apology from you
[1346.84] I want to live with you too
[1349.36] Stop it,
[1351.28] I can forgive you but I cannot
[1353.68] live with you never I
[1356.88] know
[1359.92] Minal my mistake is very big
[1362.68] but
[1364.80] you are the owner of a very big surf I am
[1368.80] sure that one day you will
[1370.36] definitely forgive me
[1380.97] [Music] If I
[1382.76] forgive you then you will also be good to me
[1386.04] [Music]
[1391.64] [Music] So
[1432.20] true I want to
[1438.76] make coffee for you
[1443.49] [Music] I know what
[1446.36] you are going
[1449.48] through I know you did not like mom's decision Nest
[1452.24] I also felt very strange
[1456.04] [Music]
[1458.52] Hearing this a man like Kamran should be forgiven again
[1461.80] Giving a chance is no less than a mistake.
[1464.32] A person who can stoop so low for money
[1467.44] can do anything
[1468.79] [Sangeet] He has gone
[1470.52] out of my heart
[1472.52] and I can never give that person that status and respect.
[1477.20] I
[1481.20] understand, but Mom is pressurizing him,
[1484.44] saying that she wants to bring Kamran to this house.
[1486.42] [Sangeet]
[1488.16] Look, don't think too much, I will talk to Mom
[1491.68] myself about this. Talk about it.
[1493.80] You don't need to talk in our domestic matters.
[1497.32] Whatever decision I take for Baral, I will
[1500.12] take it. I know what is best for him. Did
[1501.80] n't you understand? There is nothing like that. I was
[1507.84] just
[1510.64] explaining to him. What were you explaining? We do
[1513.32] n't need your advice. Kamran will
[1516.08] come to this house as a son-in-law.
[1518.72] You should understand this. And you should
[1522.40] worry about your father more than us. Ever since your mother passed away,
[1524.36] you haven't even given a lift to your father.
[1526.24] Okay, whatever he is,
[1528.36] good or bad, he is your father and in this bad
[1530.56] time, you should be with him.
[1532.20] What do you mean? Do
[1533.56] n't you know, your father has two crores.  A
[1537.52] case of embezzlement has been filed against Umar
[1548.40] Bhabhi. She got the job with great difficulty, on
[1551.00] my request and recommendation. How could I have known
[1553.52] that I would have to face so much humiliation. Some people do
[1555.56] not like respect. But Sahab is an
[1558.00] old acquaintance of ours. We have been
[1559.84] associated with him for years.
[1562.08] Your father has humiliated us. We are not able to show our face anywhere.
[1567.68] I ask the driver to take her to
[1570.60] meet her father. She will be fine
[1573.80] mom. Bhabhi. Everything will be okay. Just
[1580.28] relax, please Bhabhi.
[1583.21] [Sangeet]
[1590.52] How did all this happen? Why did you not tell me?
[1595.68] Your father did not do anything.
[1599.20] You being a daughter, are not taking revenge on him. So
[1602.24] why should I trust strangers? You
[1609.00] explain to her [Sangeet] What can I explain? I am
[1613.44] very upset with her.
[1616.52] We have lost our sleep.
[1620.60] After all, we had such an old relationship with Sahab.
[1624.04] We were business partners and now,
[1626.56] why didn't you tell me? You have been enduring
[1630.04] everything of yours alone. I and Umar
[1632.76] called you so many times, but you kept ignoring us.
[1637.64] After mother's death, you turned back.  You did not
[1640.40] even bother to check on us Umar even went to meet you
[1643.52] but you turned him back from the door, does
[1646.68] any child treat his father like this? Dadu,
[1649.88] you know very well
[1652.56] why I am angry with him, he insulted me in
[1656.28] front of my own relatives. This job was got to him by
[1659.76] Shajar's family and
[1662.36] before doing this, he did not even think
[1664.08] what effect it will have on his family. Ram Meen,
[1666.16] what happened, come on, I did not bring
[1667.76] you here to tell you all these things.
[1674.64] Grandma is also alone like us in this situation,
[1680.04] we should support him, do
[1682.92] n't worry, we are with you and everything will be
[1687.12] fine.
[1688.60] Anyway, what is your fault in this whole thing,
[1691.32] Umar is not at fault either
[1699.39] [Music]
[1717.24] Sari Umar Hasan sahab's lawyer
[1719.20] sent a legal notice from the court, in which it is mentioned that
[1721.84] I got his forged signature done and
[1723.80] trapped him in the accusation of ban, see
[1735.44] believe
[1747.17] [Music]
[1753.72] Umar, my
[1756.44] goodness, there is a limit to even a tie, one is
[1761.36] theft and on top of that, chest-thumping. Hey, he should be
[1766.16] thankful to me that I did not get him arrested till date,
[1771.32] sir, this is  You have a high command, right?
[1775.08] But I think that now we should
[1777.20] not give him any more leniency. His crime is
[1780.28] unforgivable and he should be punished as soon as possible.
[1786.84] You know,
[1790.08] Razwan, actually he has sent this notice to blackmail me.
[1793.52] Sir,
[1799.64] he wants
[1801.40] me to come under pressure due to the fear of my clients and the
[1804.52] fear of failure in business. I should
[1808.32] forgive him.
[1812.32] But this cannot happen,
[1820.56] never can happen.
[1824.75] [Music] What are
[1838.36] you saying? I tried to convince you in every way, tried to make you understand,
[1841.24] but you did
[1843.40] not understand. Kamran will stay in this house as a son-in-law. This is
[1846.72] my decision. That cheap,
[1849.08] deceptive person you are trying to bring into this house has
[1851.40] already apologized to you. Whatever he had
[1854.24] looted from us, he has put it at your feet. He has absolved himself of
[1856.16] his mistake.
[1859.04] This is enough.
[1861.68] Our daughter has already suffered a lot because of your wrong decision.
[1864.32] Now once again you are trying to push her into that quagmire.
[1866.44] You do
[1868.60] not need to worry about Minal. I am there to
[1870.28] take decisions about her life.  For example, Minal, I
[1872.88] also have a daughter. You have not brought her with you as dowry.
[1878.56] And listen to me, that person will
[1882.56] never come to this house. I cannot allow that at any cost.
[1885.44] I will make him take account of every single thing of my daughter.
[1889.88] And listen to me carefully.
[1892.84] If that person comes to this house today, then you and
[1896.80] your mother will leave this house forever.
[1899.28] Speak in a low voice. And you
[1903.08] also listen carefully. If you
[1906.40] try to mess with me in this matter, then I will get you
[1908.64] admitted to a mental hospital.
[1910.88] And mind you, your son Shajar will get you
[1914.72] admitted there himself. You woman,
[1918.84] you have brought my son against me.
[1922.00] I am your life.

[1932.54] [Music]
[1941.60] Shajar Shaj Minal, look what has happened to your dad.
[1944.56] Come quickly. Come quickly.
[1948.24] Look what has happened to your dad. Come to the
[1952.04] hospital. Hurry up.
[1954.80] Hurry up.
[1981.87] [Music]
[2039.52] What happened, son? Everything is fine.
[2042.24] You are very worried about your son-in-law. I am
[2045.88] not worried about my son-in-law. I am worried about you. I am
[2049.84] scared that you might do something like that.  Do it
[2052.92] so that we all get into trouble
[2055.88] Hey, don't worry, nothing like this will
[2059.16] happen to me, then talk to me I
[2061.16] told you that I will do something such that
[2063.92] even the snake will die and the stick will not
[2065.96] break Majur, this sahab was already a laborer, now he is
[2069.52] completely pardoned, I thought
[2072.48] that maybe he would get rid of my life but come on, it's no
[2074.76] problem, you will be lying in some corner of the house like a living corpse [
