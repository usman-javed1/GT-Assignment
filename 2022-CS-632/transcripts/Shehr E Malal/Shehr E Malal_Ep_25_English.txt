[Music] Mera dil to sher-e- malal hai please forgive me, I am afraid, why don't I cry, what else can I do I never respected my father, you are my greatness, son, that you considered him as your daughter and not your sister [Music] [Music] [Music] Yes, listen to me, if you are not coming, then I am coming there hello, he switched off the phone, I don't know what is the matter, he is not listening to me at all, I have been feeling this attitude of his since a long time, he is feeling upset with you, is he angry with you? No, why would he be angry with me, there is nothing like that, but this night his behaviour has changed with me, really, he is a little aloof, but he has gone because of the farm house and the ranch, I think they had a fight, did you talk about divorcing Raman, I think I won't need to tell him, maybe this work will happen on its own, it's good, where are you, you have no idea, how much we all are worried for you, I had even told you that you had messaged at the farm house Why are you angry with me? At least you should have talked to me. Let me explain. We will go to the hospital tomorrow and discuss everything. What has happened? Are you fine? You have a headache. I will give you a tablet. I will take it. [Music] What is this? You know very well what is this. Since when have you been using it? I am not using it. What has happened, Shaz. I don't know where these have come from. Don't act too naive. I know very well since when you have been using this and that too without my permission. Today is the worst day of my life because whoever I trusted, they all have broken my trust. Well, where there is no trust, there is no love either. [Music] What kind of trust can there be? [Music] Look, this is your document, in which Rizwan had made you sign and it also has bank statements of six months, sahab. And along with it, two weeks ago, this cheque of one or two crore rupees has been credited. How silently you kept weaving a trap against me and I did not even know that if this cheque of two crore rupees was credited to you, how silently you kept weaving a trap against me and I did not even know.  If the cheque was not credited, I could have saved you, but have faith in Allah, Insha Taala, he will find a way out because he is with the truth [Music] [Music] Shajar Shajar son, for such a small matter, you asked him to leave the house, what happened? [Music] You don't even want to see his face, I ca n't even tolerate him in front of me. What do you mean by this house is as much yours as it is his, but remember marriage is not a joke, understand, you have to make big sacrifices, you have to compromise, only then the matter works, forgive his mistake and broaden your heart. I cannot forgive him because he did all this without asking me, without consulting me, what do you mean, so what do you want now, you tell me nothing, I cannot forgive him, you are seeing the condition of the house, first we went through Manal's troubles, Shahnawaz is ill and Grameen's father is in jail, you should act wisely, listen to me, don't worry, whatever decision I take, I will do it after thinking, but I need some time, I need some time.  In which I can think what decision I have to take Shajar where are you going listen to me [Sangeet] Shajar I am very worried Amma has gone out in a lot of anger don't know where he has gone I was calling but the phone is also off I am afraid that he might have seen the medicine lying in the door and then he has left after fighting with Ramin hey brother find out what is the fight about these two, these days he has started behaving differently from you also not because of me but because of Brahmin you know very well that after marriage there is so much tension in the house because of Raan's domestic issues Shajar has not got even a second of peace [Sangeet] [Sangeet] it means that Shajar is going to divorce Raman soon that time is about to come Shajar's heart is filled with Raan finally this will happen there will be divorce why are you playing this dirty game with Raman tell me what have I done I have heard everything between you both to make Shajar feel bad about Raman this dirty game you are playing is injustice  I will never let this happen with Raman. Remember what I said. I thought you were a very decent and educated woman, but you turned out to be such a cheap and mean woman. I did not understand what you are saying. What have you done? I am asking me what have you done. First you made the doctors' report wrong. After that you got tablets placed in her bedroom. Then you are asking me what have you done. What have you done, what have you not done. You are planning to remove Raman from Shajar's heart just to make her hate him. You are misunderstanding. I am myself worried as to what is the matter that they are fighting. Tab has brought him to her home with so much love. Why would she hate him? You are blaming her, my daughter. This is not an accusation. This is the truth. And very soon this truth will be revealed. I will tell Shajar myself. I will tell you. You are elder to me. I respect you a lot. That is why I am listening to all this. Otherwise, no one has the need to talk to me in this tone. And as for the matter,  As for Shajar, if he comes to know that you are making such cheap allegations on me then go and tell Shajar, but remember your reality is going to be revealed now, when Shajar will come to know about you, he will start hating you, he will not even look at your face ever, if Shajar hates anyone in this world or listens to anyone or believes in anyone, then it is only me, whatever your heart desires, tell me by putting false or true words, you have my permission, she also used to praise you a lot to people, she used to talk about your love to people, she used to give examples of you, she used to fight with her brother and you, this turned out to be a matter of great regret, it is my mistake, it is my mistake that I got you married to my brother, I was very happy, very happy that after years, after mother, Shajar got a person who would love her, but today after years this misunderstanding has been cleared, another new curse, let me speak, nothing will happen Shaj listen to me, I feel that there has been some misunderstanding, they sent someone else's report to us and mine is still with them, you come with me, we  Both of them go and talk to the doctor. This ca n't happen. Even mom is not ready to listen to me. I also can't listen to you right now. My mind can't accept or believe anything right now. So it would be better if you tell Majeed to leave me alone for some time. Please, you won't go. I would go myself. Shaz please one [sangeet] bye. What is it? You know very well what is it. Since when have you been using it? I am not using it. What has happened Shajar? I don't know where has it come from. Don't act so naive. I know very well since when have you been using it. And that too without my permission. Today is the worst day of my life because whoever I used to love, they all have broken my love. Okay, where there is no love, there is no love [sangeet] Shaz beta, you asked her to leave the house for such a small thing. What happened to you? This house is as much yours as it is hers. But remember, marriage is no joke.  Do you understand that you have to make big sacrifices, you have to compromise, only then the car starts moving, forgive his mistake and be kind to him, his phone is off, I don't know where he has gone, he must have gone to the farm house, that day I went there in anger, no, he is not at the farm house, I called the watchman and found out, he did not come there, so where could he have gone, I don't know, he must have gone to some friend of his, well, wherever he is, you go to him and talk to him, this woman will make him proud, call his friends, find out where he is, Amma, he has so many friends, whom will I call, no, no, I can't, you call Mamu, find out about him, his phone is off, I have to meet him, I have to talk about something very important, about Umar's case, the lawyer that Umar has hired is investigating day and night, he might find some proof against me, that's why I used to tell you not to go so far in your enmity with Umar, now I will also starve along with you, you have axed your own feet, now I will do it for you  I call Mamu and ask him to find a solution. His phone is also off. His address is not there at home. I don't know where he has gone. Let's try [Music] Ran Ran beta, where are you going beta, listen to me. What's the point of staying when Shajar doesn't have me. Wait son, just listen to me. There's no point in staying. I have tolerated a lot now. I don't know why he has left his house. I would have gone myself son. He left in anger. He will come in the morning. He will apologise to you. I am no longer interested in his apology. Not at all. Please Pappu, let me go. But son, I won't let you go anywhere. You do this. I will drop you at my apartment and when your anger cools down, you come back. Papa, there's no need to trouble you. I will stay at my friend's house. There's no need for you to go anywhere. I understand. You see, whatever is mine, yours, belongs to Manal and Shajar. I don't have any family, son. And I consider you my daughter, not my daughter-in-law. If you think of me as your daughter, please let me go. It is not right for me to stay here anymore. You are very stubborn. You are just as stubborn as Shajar. You too don't stop at anything that he gets stuck on. Come on, I will drop you at my apartment. Come with me. [Music] Come, hello brother, the curse has stopped. She left on her own. You didn't have to do anything. Wow, I am worried about Shir. I don't know where she is. Her phone is also off. I am very worried. Amma, if I can talk to her once, I will feel relieved. What has happened? You are getting worried as if she is your own child. What are you saying? What do you think? I do n't care about Shajar. He doesn't mean anything to me. Okay, I married Ran for some other reason, but I cannot lose Shir. His importance to me is something that none of you can understand or know. It is a different matter that I am not his biological mother. He is not my biological blood. But perhaps I have loved him more than a biological mother. The whole world is against me.  I don't care if he turns his back on me, I won't be able to tolerate it [Music] Ta Banda son, he is your child and will be yours, do n't worry, he will come back to you [Music] Raman, now you can stay in this flat as long as you want, son, all the things you need are here, there are two servants, but son, if you still need anything, you can call me, do you have any idea where Shajar would be, I don't know about Shajar right now, but Shahnawaz is also not aware of his absence, please stay here, don't go back with me, son, you know that I ca n't leave Shahnawaz alone in this condition, he needs me and I can't leave him at the mercy of the servants, neither is aunty there, why do you need to go to take care of him, I wish this could happen, what do you mean, she doesn't take care of him, Raman, I want to talk to you about Ta Banda, yes, he said, I am listening, today I heard very strange things about Ta Banda and her mother [Music], I am very worried  It happened, I myself wanted to talk to Shaz about this, but I have also been seeing since morning that you are very disturbed, Bakul is quiet, you want to say something but are unable to speak, what happened, why are you upset, son? I myself have gone through a lot of trouble [sangeet] I am not able to understand how a woman can stoop to such an extent, I also do not have an answer to these questions, so Binda worked with a big plan, why does she want me to get out of Shaz's life, Shanavas's condition is also not such that I can tell him anything and Manal has also gone through so much stress, if she comes to know about her mother's actions, I don't know how she will react [sangeet], you can stay here as long as you want, I was just saying that inform your family members so that they do not worry about you and especially Bhabhi, if you do not call them and tell them, then I will talk to them myself, no no, that is not needed [sangeet] no, I was thinking that I will start going to office from tomorrow  Do infact now I should go to office regularly and as far as Ran is concerned I will talk to Ran Ran too, don't worry you are a very good friend you have helped me a lot thank you so what would you be a friend for, okay as you wish [Music] where had you gone Amma was so worried she followed you to Hyderabad, yes I had gone to Hyderabad for some important work, in fact I have opened a hotel there, what hotel and now I am shifting there, shifting means brother I have built my own hotel, I have stayed there so now to look after it I will have to stay there myself, what are you saying, how can you leave me in these circumstances, you know how much problem I am in, I supported you in all the good work, despite knowing so many secrets I never opened my mouth, but what did you give me, you only tried to keep me as a slave, no now this won't work, not at all, what has happened to you, I need your help right now, Umar Hasan's lawyer has found evidence against Baker Sahab's manager, I knew that the police is inquiring and Umar Hasan  The lawyer is a very smart man, he will win this case. I have made my arrangements and have taken a narrow path from here. I say the same to you, make your arrangements. I am not one of those who give up. I will not go anywhere. This overconfidence of yours will sink you someday. I say to you, get Shahnawaz to transfer Minal's property in his name and whatever you have to collect, collect it and leave from here because the day Rizwan is caught and he opens his mouth, he will first take your name. Don't try to intimidate me. I am not a weak woman that I will sit at home in fear of these threats. How much did I tell you not to file a case against Umar Hasan on charges of embezzlement? Whose words do you listen to? All your life you have done as you please. Now pay for it. Give your resignation and go. Do n't worry about me. You know how to deal with problems. I do n't need your help. Now will you send me away empty-handed from here? You don't know how many wrong things I did for you in return.  You have been taking a lot, you have given me more than your worth, I will take you with me, I will never leave you, but one more thing, along with those important things, I also need two crore rupees, I will take that as well, what two crores, have I lost my mind [music] yours, hello Shajar, where had you gone, I searched for you so much, I also enquired from your friends, I 'm really sorry, Bhap, I am not able to understand anything at that time, I am very sorry to you guys, where is Sham Ran, I called home, Manal told me that she has left the house two days ago, son, she is with me in the apartment, you don't worry about her, you just come, when are you coming, you are not coming right now, there is a lot of work that I have to do, I have brought a lot of things to their conclusion, I am investigating something, I also have to get Pluser uncle released from jail, what kind of investigation are you doing, son, tell me everything when the time comes, son, I have to talk to you about some important things about this man, what things, yes, you will regret hearing this, but see, it is very important to bring it to your knowledge  It is important to talk openly, what are you saying son, the thing is that that guy had prepared a fake report by paying money to the doctors and he also got the medicines, look night I am also very worried for the last two days, your mother used to love you a lot, then why does she hate your wife, why does she hate Umar Hasan and not Ran, I have come to know about this, I am calling you to tell you all this [Music] [Music] [Music] Why have you come here, Bhaiya, it is important to talk to you, don't even take my name with your dirty and cheap tongue, get out of my room Meeran, I agree that I am very ashamed of whatever I did, look I am apologizing with folded hands in front of you, I have made a mistake, look Minal, I love you too much, don't touch me, don't come close to me, don't touch me, otherwise I will call someone and throw you out of the house Minal, I am your husband, no, you are not my husband, you are not my noise [Music] Even if you slit your throat and put it in front of me, even then  I will not forgive you, because of the acid you are tolerating it in this house, you have taken freedom from you, let me understand the condition of my dad once, mom, you will beat me and throw me out of this house, I am telling you that I am very ashamed of my actions, don't you underestimate me, just leave me, just leave me [Music] [Music] When the crazy guy woke up and you brought disgrace on me, brother I had already told you, your plans will not work here, get out of here, shut up, I understood what you said, I got scared [Music], hey, the one who cheated in love, the one who ran away after giving the false promise of marriage, I swear, I am feeling happy till the end after seeing you like this, brother one thing is clear for you, nothing can happen here now, there is still time, give up and go, brother Manal has already refused to accept you as her husband, now you have two options, either you live in this house like a servant or as a son-in-law, the decision is yours, if yes, then wrong [Music] [Music] [Music] Don't be my problem or my issue  No, you wanted love, but did you get it? You thought that if you begged, fell at her feet, apologized, she would forgive you, especially after what you did to her, I did not forgive you either. Remember my two things. First, that there should be no negligence in the work for which I have brought you here. Second, that no memory of yours should hurt Manar. Otherwise, you know very well what I can do to you. It does not feel good to cry and wail everyday. It is strange that she kept taking revenge for her failed love from all of us. She destroyed Umar Hasan, not only Umar uncle, she destroyed his entire family. Ran's mom also died because of this hobby. All this kept happening and we did not know anything about that woman's actions. That woman was not even identified. Whatever happened, along with mom, her mother is also at fault. And now we have come to know what happened to her uncle. Yes, the strange thing is that Qayum Sahab who works in our office  This is such a big thing that she hid from us. She has hidden a lot from us. But the game that Mom was playing with us for so many years, the time has come to turn the tables. Qayum sahab has resigned today and has done so with the threat that he will reveal all the secrets of Mom. He knew that now in difficult times only honest people stand with us. What to do next from here I don't understand anything. How to tell all this to Ran and Minal. How to get Umar uncle out of jail and how to bring all of them to their end. I will do all this only then I will get peace. In these circumstances I cannot take Ran home with me, so she can stay with you for a few days. What are you saying? You are with me, why do you worry? Thank you, where are you now? Sorry [Sangeet] [Sangeet] [Sangeet] Where was Mom? You were in important meetings. What happened? Dad is unwell. There is no one to take care of Dad. Brother has not come home for three days. She has shifted to her apartment with Bhabhi and I  I feel very uncomfortable in Kamran's presence. He came to my room today also to apologise to me. You should listen to him, consider his opposition and his apology. Then we will see what to do. I am not able to understand why you get so upset about him. What do you want? Forgive him. What do you want? I want you to talk to him about divorce right now. Your tongue has started running too much. I have been seeing you for a while. Have you ever seen Shajar talking like this to me? I do n't know where your brother is. He has gone after a fight with Kamran. After that, his cell is off. I am trying to find out. I will see your dad [Sangeet], how are you? What are you saying? Why do you talk like this? A doctor had come to me. I don't need any doctor [Sangeet], it is Shajar's [Sangeet], I am asking where is he and you have gone [Sangeet], no one has asked me for the last three days. You went out of town for some work and Shajar is at the farm house. He will come back by tomorrow [Sangeet] [music]
