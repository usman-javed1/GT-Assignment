I instructed Rameen to send the
car and the driver to pick you up. It's not like that.
We came very comfortably in the taxi. Yes, of course. Oh, Auntie, you must've travelled
in wagons and taxis. But this would be the first time
for Mehr-un-Nisa, no? She must've been inconvenienced. There's jewelry
worth 5 crores here. Don't forget this
and remember your promise. It's just... Hina... Actually, Hina, I was thinking that... Mehru!  what are you doing? Please. Don't do this, Mehru. What palaces have you built, what factories did you start that you
took such a hefty loan from the bank? Nana gave you everything along
with his daughter and what did you do? I won't go until he answers my questions.
Why did he do this with you? What difference does it
make if she said all this? I trust you blindly.  Isn't that enough? Please forget everything she said. This is what I wanted. Is your love hiding behind all this hatred? My love was buried a long time ago... when he left me because of my status. Your revenge is done now! Leave Umar and his wife be. Your daughter-in-law lost jewelry
worth crores.  Don't you care about that? No, I... I know it's a huge loss, but I don't want to say anything to Rameen
and upset Shahzar. Let everything run how it is.
We'll see it later. Shahnawaz suspects that Rameen stole
the jewellery in order to help her parents. You should prove it somehow. I don't have any evidence for this.
Where will I get it from? Oh, is it hard for you to create evidence? Be patient. Let them shift to the rented house
then we'll see what to do. I'll have to think about it. - Salam.
- Walaikum Salam. Congratulations!  You got the job, right? How do you know? I figured it out by your mood.
I'm so happy! what is this? -A car.
- No, I mean, is anyone here? Umar... this is for you. What? You bought it?
But where do you get the money from? Oh my God, Omar!  It's not that expensive.
I saw an ad for it, it's used. - So when I saw the ad... -
But still. I saw the ad in the newspaper
so I thought why not? But what I don't understand is you... You sold the furniture? But why, Mehru?  It was everything
you liked. You decorated the house with your own hands.
You brought every single thing here, you liked everything, then? Umar, I am being practical. We're moving to a smaller house.  Where
were we going to fit such heavy furniture? God is willing, if we get another chance,
we'll buy it all again. But still, man.  I don't know but I don't
like it.  You shouldn't have done this. And I didn't like you traveling
in rickshaws. We needed a car right now,
not furniture. Please don't worry. How many times do I have to say good times will
come and very soon, God is willing. You're impossible. Thank you. Why are you being so formal
with thank you and all that? Go and freshen up.  I've made
your favourite food, mutton pulao. Oh, so this mutton pulao is my favorite?
It's your favorite. Your favorites change everyday.
What can I do? I was thinking to swing by
Uncle-Auntie's place on the way back. -Yeah.
- If they need some help, so... Are you guys going somewhere? Yeah, we were just going out. We thought we'd dine out too.
Don't wait. Yeah, good idea. She was anyway feeling a little down.
It'll be a nice change.  Her mood will lift. Go on, go. And I was thinking to go over
to Uncle-Auntie's on the way back. They're shifting so we'd help them. Yeah, yeah, why not?  In fact, if you
need anything.  A car, driver, servants. - So much stuff is needed to move.
-No, Mama.  Baba has arranged everything. And he's found a job at a
really reputable company as well. Really? That's great.  congratulations. - Go, go.  Have fun.
- Okay, Mom.  Bye! Seriously, Mom?  60,000 rupees? Is this a joke? Dear, it's not a joke, but it's reality. I also got a little worried,
but we have to be practical. Finding a job at your baba's age
is very difficult, and this is just temporary. Whenever he finds a better job,
he'll quit from here. Mama, whatever it is, it was very stupid of Baba to
reject the offer from Shahzar's parents. They were insisting so much
for him to work there. But Baba is crazy with pride. He has such an extensive experience,
what's the point of this ordinary job? I can't believe
you're saying such silly things. You're an MBA graduate. Don't you know multinationals
need young people now? Experience has nothing to do with it. I'm really disappointed. He didn't think about me at all. What am I going to say to my in-laws
about his job? We didn't raise you to be like this.
Are you so shallow? Bad times don't come by asking. It's our turn today,
it'll be someone else's tomorrow. This is reality, this is life. You know, Mama, there's no point.  Right? Because you are going to support Baba
in everything. Even the wrong things that Baba does,
they appear right to you. No matter how right everything I say is,
you always believe it's wrong. And on top of it all,
you've sold all the furniture. What will you take to the new house? How long will you listen,
how long should I speak? Mr.  Umar Hassan is working
at an advertising firm for Rs 60,000. Yes!  Do you want to hear some more? You'll be very happy to hear it. He is shifting into a rented home tomorrow. In a rented house! And the rent of that house is just Rs 30,000. Now you can imagine what
a 30,000 house would be like. And listen some more!  The brand new cars
that they had, they 're all out. Now it's a used car and Umar Hassan. I need all the details of the company. Okay. Don't worry. As soon as our financial situation
improves, we will move from here. You think I'm worried
because we've shifted to this house? You seem worried. I'm only thinking where
should I start from? I've to set up the whole house.  I've only
done one room so far and I'm tired. You don't worry, I'll help you.
We'll do it together. Let the first salary come,
we'll fix this house too. We'll get it painted or something. The plants are old too, we'll change that
and let's get grass planted in the front. And that fountain.  The fountain too. When are you starting your new job though? Tomorrow morning. Tomorrow will be the first day. Everything will be fine, God willing. Come, Mr.  Hassan.  Please take a seat.
I was waiting for you. Sir, before I join, I had a few idea in
my mind that I wanted to discuss. I also wanted to discuss something
with you. Yes? We hired you in a hurry yesterday. It's our company's policy to do a
background check on all our employees. And we only make a decision
after we're completely satisfied. Sir, I don't understand
what you are trying to say. Let me clarify something
to you, Mr.  Hassan. Our company isn't an ordinary company. We don't hire people
just based on their degrees. We see a lot of other things too. Yes. Mr.  Umar, you destroyed your business
because of your wrong decisions. And that business wasn't even yours,
it was your wife's! We need honest people for our company. People don't like you. Sir, I'll try my best to live up
to your expectations. Give me a chance, I'll do my best. People like you are deceivers
and you hurt your own people. We can't hire you in our company, Mr.  Omar. Sir, I... I... - Just give me one chance.  Please.
-You can go from here. Stop it, dear.  You'll get tired. You've been working since morning.
Go and rest. Ammi... Who gets tired of doing things
in their own home. And besides, I'm not doing this alone.
You've helped me so much. You still need rest.  Go and rest. Ammi, you're making the gravy. Let me at least make salad and rotis. Okay, I'll let you do it today. But I won't let you enter the kitchen
from tomorrow. You've had servants working for you
your entire life. You never even set foot in the kitchen. And you have to make rotis today. Look at where fate has brought you. You didn't deserve a life like this. Ammi Jaan... God never tests people beyond
their tolerance. And after God... I have full faith in Umar. You'll see! Through his hard work and dedication,
he will regain his former status. God is willing, God is willing. I won't let you do anything after
you're done making rotis.  Go and rest. The gravy is ready too.  -It smells so nice!
- Does it smell nice? What if Umar rejects my rotis? No, no.  They're fine.  They're good. This is how a person learns slowly. I should add oil and make parathas. What happened?  You came back early
from the office. Mehru, please!  I don't answer
your questions. Please, man.  Leave me. I won't go anywhere until you tell me. what do you want to hear? That they fired me on my
first day of the job, claiming that they didn't need an
unreliable, fraudulent person like me. What? Mehru, there is someone... There is someone in this business sector... Someone who is taking
out their hostility on me. If I just found out once, I'll kill them. But they... who could it be?
We have no enmity with anyone either. - I am doubtful of one person.
-Who? Shehryar Anwar. Shehryar? Amma, Shahzar is not fated to be mine. Stop talking about him. Why would he leave his wife and marry me?
Have you ever thought about that. They wasted my time then,
they're wasting my time now. The first time I came here,
he went to the US to study. The second time
I'm here, he's gotten married. What's the point? And she, Tabinda Khala,
she's a very cunning woman and a liar too. She only cares
about what is beneficial to her. She called me before
and she is doing the same again. And she didn't call me for Shahzar!
She gets me to spy for her. She just gives me thousands of
rupees for it then shows me attitude. Shahzar isn't my destination, Amma. My destination is Kamran. And you know what? I have fallen in love with him. And he has also proposed to me. We are getting married very soon. We'll marry and move to Dubai,
and we'll call you there soon. Why are you always so irritated
with Kamran?  I don't get it! He's a great guy and he's very responsible. He's not as irresponsible
as you think he is. He's exactly the guy I wanted. He obeys me and is ready
to do everything for me. We've made a lot of plans. Dear, don't lose hope.  Have faith in God. If he closes one door,
he opens 70 new ones. Ammi, I'm not hopeless, but what can I do? Everything got ruined and destroyed.  You must pass this test.
Just control yourself. These harsh times will pass, God willing,
but how do I handle myself? I tried a lot... I tired a lot to save this business
somehow. Don't ever lose hope. Can your advice help me
regain my lost position? Can I regain the honor I once had? Don't talk like cowards, Omar. Face the situation. You can't just lose courage like this
and sit back. I was trying to gather courage. I was trying to fight like men too but the
whole world thinks I'm a thief, a fraud. How do I make them believe that I haven't
recklessly ruined my wife's business! Omar, you don't have to make anyone
believe you. Mehr-un-Nisa has always trusted you,
she still does. You shouldn't think about what anyone says
or thinks. Just thank God that you've
gotten a loving wife like Mehru. That's true but I have to think
about the world too. I have to get a job with them,
whatever I do, I have to do it with them. And someone is constantly telling them
that I am a fraudulent man. I cheated my father in law. Don't worry, everything is going to be fine. Umar is doubting Shehryar. He thinks he's the one bad-mouthing him
throughout the business circle. Umar has lost his mind. He's doubting a good man for no reason. Shehryar might be a bit bitter,
but he's not a bad man. And you shouldn't mind him either. He'll stop being so
irritated once he finds a job. But, Amma... Umar never spoke to me this way before. Don't worry, he'll be fine. Amma... I was thinking that... God forbid if... if Umar doesn't find a suitable job, so... I'll get a job. What? Will you get a job?  No, no, no. You can't work. Umar wouldn't want that and neither do I that
you go out and work while you're sick. No, I will get a job. Even if you and Umar didn't like it. We need it. Umar's career has been destroyed. He didn't just lose his job. He was so disgraced
and slandered in the city that nobody wants to hire him
or have any association with him. I still remember when Rashda sent sweets
when Umar's proposal was fixed. You cried so much. -How much did you suffer?
- I remember. I remember every single moment. You were saying that they've shifted
to a slump or something? So why don't you do this, take Shahnawaz
and go over to their home. So Shahnawaz knows that he has married his
brilliant son into such an ordinary family. His career is destroyed,
he doesn't have a job, Now, he will live a life of
dependence for the rest of his life. I'm just waiting for the moment when he will come to me, crawling
and begging for help. He'll be indebted to me
for the rest of his life and his daughter's eyes
will forever be downcast with gratitude. His pride will turn to dust. And she won't ever dare to open her mouth
in front of me. I am waiting for that time. -Who is it?
-Mama, it's us. - Please open the door.
- Okay! - Salam, come in.
- Salam. - Salam.
-Salam, son. You two must have very long lives,
touch wood. I was just thinking of calling you
and inviting you over. -Dear, did you find the house easily?  -Yes
, yes.  It was not an issue. -Come in.  -Yes
.  Rameen?  Come in. Hello, Minal.  What's going on? Nothing.  I was just going out for shopping. Oh, I was just coming to ask you
to let's go shopping. I asked your sister-in-law as well,
but she went somewhere with Shahzar. We'll shop and then go to a nice place
to eat.  Sounds good? It'll take a lot of time if we stop to eat. And Mom wouldn't allow me to stay out
for so long. Are you a child that you
require someone's permission? And I'm with you to look out for you. And what issue would khala have
if I'm with you. Okay, don't be upset.
I'll ask mom for permission. We'll watch a movie and go to a nice place
for dinner too! All right.  You go on,
I'll come in 2 minutes. Okay. Pick up the phone! Yes, hello. I am leaving.  I'll send you the address
the moment I get there.  Come quickly.  Is everything right?  Don't be late!  Okay. Mom, why these formalities?
We'll leave now. What formality? I thought I'd make Shahzar's favorite
chicken biryani. - We've had tea, right?  That's enough.
-How is that possible? You've come to our home for the first time
and we should send you off without dinner? Umar also wanted you guys
to have dinner with us. He has only gone out for a little while,
he'll be back soon. Mama, I don't want to meet him. I've come to meet you. We'll just leave now.  Let it be. What's wrong with you, Rameen? what are you saying? And you... why are you so mistrustful of your father? Because I have a lot of reasons to be. And you'll never understand that
because there's a veil over your eyes. And you don't see anyone except him. Please, Rameen. Mama, you can silence me. How are you going to silence the
people talking about us in the world? The thing that the entire family is saying
about Baba's character, do you have any idea about that?  But no! You're not hearing anything.
You don't see anyone except him. I know.  I know everything. But I don't care about people. Nor do I want to shut them up.  Do you know what upsets me? Your words! And your behavior hurts me. Who is it?  Who is this enemy of ours
that has filled your head with poison? What kind of daughter are you?
You know your father is upset right now. You should encourage him, talk positively,
and what are you doing? You're coming here with this attitude? When did you become so insensitive? I don't know how you guys live here. It's so weird here, such weird people. I felt so embarrassed to come here
with Shahzar. -What could he be thinking about us?
-What could he be thinking?  What? That we've fallen to the floor
from the sky?  So what? How long is he going to think like that?
He'll get sued for it. Rameen, we have to live here.
This is our lifestyle now. I won't let you live here. Really?  Fine.  I'm ready.  where are
you going to take us?  To your in-laws? Take some advice from your mother. The sooner you accept this reality,
the better it is for you. And thank God... it's not such a big deal.
People go through very bad times. They love in worse conditions than us. You should be proud of your father. He is such a graceful man
with such a strong character. What are you doing/ And top it all off,
instead of helping your mother, you're showing attitude and passing judgment
, and holding councils, Go.  Please go and let me make biryani. You must be getting sweaty in the kitchen. The food was really nice though. -The masala tikka was really nice.
-Very tasty. And that juice?  Wow! Who's this weird guy? Idiot.  He parked his car right behind mine. Let me just talk to him!
