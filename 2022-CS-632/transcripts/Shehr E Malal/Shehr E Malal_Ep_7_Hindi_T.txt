[19.05] Oh, we'll know what grand is on the walima.
[22.88] So Shahzar was saying it'll either
be held in Singapore or Thailand.
[26.47] Auntie has been busy with the bookings,
[28.33] so everything will be finalized
in the next 3-4 days.
[30.50] But I just have a little request
that do something that...
[35.00] we still maintain some respect
among those we associate with.
[40.28] Yes, Mr. Gondal. This is Mr. Gondal Mehr,
Vice President of Mehr Estate.
[45.93] Oh, touch wood!
[46.65] And this is Shahzar’s father-in-law,
Umar Hassan.
[49.22] - Salam.
- Oh! Hello, Mr. Umar.
[50.92] - How are you? Nice to meet you.
- I'm good.
[53.13] - Salam.
- My wife.
[54.88] I see, right.
By the way, what do you do?
[58.67] I have a business; I--
[60.04] He manages his father-in-law’s business,
and he also have a small advertising firm.
[66.96] I see.
[68.93] What was your father-in-law’s name?
[73.16] - Yes, it was Manzoor Hussain.
- Manzoor Hussain?
[77.55] It's the same Manzoor Hussain the one who,
18 years ago,
[82.36] - passed away due to a heart failure?
- Yes.
[85.47] Yes, he was a very
close friend of my father's.
[89.15] He had a very big business.
[91.40] I’ve heard the business collapsed,
didn’t it?  What happened though?
[98.16] He was a well-known figure,
Manzoor Hussain.
[102.46] Running a business
isn’t everyone’s cup of tea,
[105.90] and if you can’t handle it properly,
it gets shut down like that.
[111.11] But it’s very sad.
[114.14] I’m really sorry to hear that.
So sad.
[131.10] I really dislike Tabinda.
[133.19] I really hated some of the things
she has done.
[136.44] What does she think of herself?
[138.35] I mean, did you notice how she insulted us
in front of everyone?
[143.85] She treated me like a maid.
Such a rude and disrespectful woman.
[149.64] I’ve never seen such a rude woman
like that in my life.
[155.78] I’m really worried about my daughter.
I mean, just think,
[160.02] how is this poor girl going to deal
with her tricks?
[163.77] Poor girl, a tough time is coming.
[170.44] Umar?
[173.35] Are you okay?
[179.04] The new project...
[182.34] it's very important for me.
[185.62] Please pray that I get it.
[192.05] God willing, this project will be yours.
[197.34] I know. lately you...
[201.74] have been really stressed.
[204.29] I’m sorry, I’ve been selfish,
caught up in my own issues.
[211.36] Please don't worry.
[227.11] Salam, sir.
[229.79] Where have you been? I’ve been looking for
you since morning. You didn’t report to me.
[233.58] What happened with that Rizwan & Co.?
[236.45] - Did they mail you or something?
- Sir, I have a bad news for you.
[241.08] Rizwan and Co. have finalized
a deal with someone else,
[245.39] and the Citrus Fruit people have also
signed a contract with another company.
[249.63] What?
[252.13] How is this possible? I just--
[255.04] I spoke to them just yesterday!
[256.98] Sir, this is a 100% report!
Look, here’s the email copy.
[263.51] Sir, look, they’ve canceled it!
[269.02] - Sir.
- Oh, God.
[271.79] Sir?
[274.68] Sir, I’ll take the car
and head to the hospital.
[277.78] - No car. I've a lot of work to do here.
- Sir?
[281.16] Please, sir, let’s go to the hospital.
Please, sir.
[284.55] I’m fine.
[286.02] - Just get me some water.
- Okay, sir.
[288.82] Please go quickly.
[308.54] In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious,
the Most Merciful.
[310.82] Umar Hassan bin Umar Hassan,
[313.20] your nikah to Shahzar

[399.81] - Mr. Shahzar, do you accept this nikkah?
- Yes, I--
[423.11] I accept.
[443.64] - Nano?
- Yeah?
[445.06] I've looked everywhere
and you're standing here.
[447.42] Come, we have to take pictures.
[448.64] - Come.
- Come, come.
[449.96] I was looking for you
since so long.
[451.33] - Oh, I was just here.
- I looked there, I looked here.
[458.17] Yes, yes. Yes, Salam.
[461.04] Yes, I understand your point, but...
[464.81] but please wait a few days.
It’s my daughter’s wedding today.
[469.91] No, no, I’ll pay you back for every penny.
Just give me some time.
[476.69] Look, you--
[478.67] Yes, I understand your situation,
but...
[481.77] You know in business, money
can’t just be withdrawn immediately;
[484.43] it will take some time, right?
[486.78] Please trust me. I’m telling you.
[492.11] Yes, yes. I understand your point.
[496.99] Yes, all right.
[566.79] Umar.
[568.72] Where are you lost? I was standing on
the stage, signaling to you since so long.
[573.11] I was watching my daughter.
[575.64] She looks so beautiful, right?
[579.12] Touch wood.
[580.70] Our daughter is the most beautiful bride
in the world
[587.43] Now, it’s time to bid her farewell.
[595.15] Are you ready?
[597.62] Yes.
[599.25] I'm ready.
[603.52] So, tell me, are you ready
for the rukhsati?
[606.86] - We are.
- So when?
[609.07] - I'll ask and let you know.
- Hurry up a little.
[626.40] - Mehru.
- Yes?
[627.44] They're asking about the rukhsati.
[630.33] - I came to call Umar for that only.
- Yes, let's go.
[633.86] Let's go.
[707.70] Where's Baba?
[771.76] Baba!
[803.61] Baba, what happened to you?
[805.23] - Umar! Umar!
- Call the ambulance, quickly!
[807.23] - Please--
- Umar!
[807.97] Call the ambulance!
[809.35] - Baba, what happened? Please get up.
- Call the ambulance, quickly! Umar!
[811.46] Umar! Umar!
[814.23] - Please call the ambulance.
- Umar!
[817.31] Umar, my son! Umar!
[877.71] Careful.
[879.38] - Mama, I'll go with Baba! Please.
- Rameen, please.
[882.58] Your rukhsati just took place.
[883.91] - You go with them. Rameen, please!
- I can't just leave him like that and go!
[886.22] Please!
[888.20] Rameen, I'm going with uncle.
[891.14] Trust me, nothing will happen to him.
Trust me.
[895.53] Come on. Come sit in the car.
[916.71] Auntie, why did you snatch my phone?
[918.57] No, no. What's wrong with you?
[920.36] She's not snatching it. She'll return it
in the morning. It's okay.
[922.67] Why until morning?
[925.14] Look, girl. Stop crying.
It's considered unlucky.
[930.26] And mourning like this on the day on
the day of your wedding? It's very wrong!
[934.93] Do you understand?
[936.16] Nothing like this ever happened
in our family!
[939.39] May God have mercy on our house.
[942.03] Auntie, please give me the phone back. I
need to ask about Baba’s health from Mama.
[946.81] It'll be bad if you step into this house
with this sorrowful face!
[951.26] Step into the house with a smiling face.
Do you understand?
[955.78] And you call Shahzar
and call him to quickly come home.
[958.59] I'll call him. Come on, you come in
and rest.
[961.23] Relax a little, we'll call them.
I'll speak to Shahzar. Come, come. Good.
[976.14] Here you go. I've got this for you.
Eat something. You didn't eat anything.
[980.24] - No, no--
- Please, please.
[983.22] - Where's Auntie?
- She's inside with Umar.
[988.20] Don't worry; everything will be fine.
[990.28] Please pray.
[992.32] - I pray to God that my son recovers soon.
- Yes.
[1039.88] Oh, Rameen, you're crying?
[1042.98] Shahzar's just about to come.
Are you going to welcome him like this?
[1045.68] Maria, please let me speak to Shahzar.
[1049.09] I don't know how Baba's doing,
what's happened to him!
[1051.83] How is he doing now?
Please let me speak to Shahzar once.
[1055.05] Oh! You still haven't spoken to Shahzar.
[1057.79] How would I speak to him?
Auntie snatched my phone!
[1061.55] Please help me. Please.
[1064.27] Just let me speak to Shahzar once.
Call and ask him yourself.
[1068.34] I spoke to Shahzar.
[1070.86] He said your dad's
in a very serious condition.
[1073.65] They might have to spend the night
at the hospital.
[1075.91] Maria, please tell me the truth.
\What has happened?
[1078.60] Oh, you don't worry. Drink this juice.
I'll make you talk to him right away.
[1082.12] I don't need anything. Just tell me
what has happened to my father!
[1085.87] I'll get you to talk to him.
Don't worry.
[1088.04] Here, drink this juice. Come on.
Come on, like good girls, come on.
[1097.96] You have to finish the whole thing,
come on.
[1110.76] Why isn't she picking up?
[1125.63] What did she say?
[1127.97] You don't worry.
[1130.60] Uncle will be absolutely fine.
[1132.40] God, have mercy on us.
[1175.00] I told you to give her a sleeping pill
and put her to bed.
[1180.28] Don't worry. I've done everything.
[1182.42] I've put her to bed, changed her
clothes, and removed her makeup
[1185.43] - She won't wake up before morning.
- All right.
[1191.11] Poor Shahzar.
[1192.14] His excitement will vanish
when he sees his wife sleeping.
[1197.09] Okay, hold this.
[1198.32] It's Rameen's phone.
Put it on her bedside table.
[1202.19] And come to me after this, I have to
talk to you about something important.
[1204.39] Okay.
[1206.21] Go, go. Quickly.
[1207.89] - All right.
- Shahzar's about to come. Quickly go.
[1265.15] What's wrong, Rameen?
Why aren't you picking up?
[1270.69] Mr. Shahzar, the doctor is calling you.
[1274.06] Let's go.
[1411.20] Rameen.
[1413.71] Rameen, wake up. It's morning.
[1419.40] Rameen.
[1421.65] Wake up. It's morning.
[1426.64] Oh, man?
[1432.40] Rameen, everyone's waiting for us
for breakfast. Wake up.
[1438.59] Rameen!
[1455.30] Where's Rameen?
[1460.68] She's still sleeping. She'll wake up
in a while and come.
[1464.08] I'll call her.
[1466.66] I tried but she didn't wake up.
She's in a very deep sleep.
[1469.42] You eat your breakfast.
[1470.96] Oh, let it be. She must be tired.
[1472.73] There's a million things to do before
a wedding. She must be exhausted!
[1475.89] Khala, what kinds of things to do?
[1478.33] Besides, I didn't even see her dowry.
[1481.86] No, no. It's not like that. They wanted
to give her a dowry, I told them not to.
[1485.93] Mr. Umar was really insisting on it,
but I said no. This won't happen.
[1489.88] They did give her a car and the
functions was also beyond my expectations.
[1495.46] She's their only daughter.
[1498.99] And Umar Bhai did all the arrangements
himself.
[1501.97] Because they've married their daughter
in a respectable family.
[1505.79] How is he doing now?
[1507.41] Yes, he's much better than before.
[1508.67] I just spoke to Auntie.
[1509.78] She said they'll discharge
him before evening.
[1513.69] I think I should call and inquire
about his health.
[1516.43] Then I have to invite them for the walima
as well.
[1519.09] That won't be needed.
I've canceled the walima function.
[1527.53] Did you cancel your walima?
[1529.72] Shahzar, your father-in-law is so sick.
[1532.51] In this situation, it doesn’t feel right
to go abroad and celebrate.
[1537.95] But we made so many arrangements
and sent out invitations.
[1542.10] We paid the advance.
The booking is already done.
[1544.79] Why are you getting worried?
I'll handle it.
[1547.21] I spoke to the travel agent, 
the tickets are canceled,
[1550.70] and my secretary will personally
call everyone today to apologize.
[1556.07] There won't be a walima.
[1558.37] What’s this, Mom? You canceled the plan? 
I was so excited!
[1561.70] Look, right now, we need to think about
Rameen's family more than our own happiness.
[1565.17] She’s a part of our family now, 
we have a relationship with them.
[1569.93] Mom, really, after doing this, 
you’ve won my heart.
[1572.59] Anything for you.
[1573.97] Next week, we will host a memorable
event to celebrate the joy of this wedding.
[1578.67] and invite our friends and family. 
We’ll celebrate then.
[1582.78] This is good, right? Come on, now. 
Fix your mood.
[1587.43] Grump!
[1594.21] Rameen!
[1601.45] Rameen, get up, it’s already 11!
What's wrong with you?
[1605.26] Get up!
[1611.28] It’s morning?
[1613.53] Yes, it’s morning, and you’ve
been sleeping the whole night.
[1617.39] How's Baba now?
[1622.01] Don’t worry, he’s fine.
[1623.98] I stayed with him in the
hospital the whole night.
[1626.87] I expected you to call and check on him,
[1631.34] but you didn’t even pick up my calls.
[1633.77] I don’t understand, it was our
wedding night, and you slept through it.
[1641.16] I would’ve called
if I had my phone.
[1644.28] - Your grandmother took my phone.
- What nonsense!
[1647.48] - Why would she do that? 
- You should ask her this.
[1651.06] Shahzar, you kept saying that your
dad had a problem with our wedding.
[1655.24] But I think your mom has a problem
with us.
[1657.99] She hates me!
[1659.44] - Mom doesn’t have any issue with you!
- She doesn’t like me!
[1663.54] If my mom had a problem with you, 
you wouldn’t be in this house right now.
[1668.54] If she had a problem,
she wouldn’t have supported you.
[1672.16] She wouldn’t have convinced Dad.
[1674.55] As for your phone...
[1676.98] so here.
[1678.42] This is your phone.
[1680.26] Which, apparently, Nano took from you.
[1685.54] Shahzar, I’m not lying, and--
[1687.30] I just know that on our wedding night, 
and you were sleeping.
[1691.95] Your dad was in the hospital,
I was with him, and you kept sleeping.
[1696.06] That's it!
[1696.96] Listen, I’m really sorry,
[1698.61] I honestly don’t even remember when I fell 
into such a deep sleep.
[1704.05] Please take me to see Baba.
[1705.97] Fine, I'll take you in the evening.
Right now, everyone's waiting you outside.
[1708.90] Shahzar, he suffered a heart attack
yesterday on our wedding day,
[1712.00] please take now.
[1713.25] Fine, I'll take you.
[1715.54] I'm getting ready, you get dressed too.
[1748.54] Are you going somewhere?
[1749.73]  Oh, I was going to meet Baba 
to check on his health.
[1753.18] His health is better, but good, 
you should definitely go.
[1758.63] But how are you going like this?
Your parents will be worried.
[1762.93] Your mother is sick, 
and your father is too.
[1765.31] What will they think
seeing you like this?
[1767.42] You're a new bride.
You should dress up more.
[1771.10] At least in the early days, right?
[1774.76] I just wanted to say something, 
think of it as an advice.
[1778.24] You’re newly married, 
it’ll take some time to adjust.
[1782.40] But if you want to see your in-laws
and your parents happy,
[1787.56] just try to avoid discussing your in-laws
at your parents' house, and vice versa.
[1793.88] You understand, right? You’re smart.
[1797.33] You guys are going then?
[1798.89] What is this meeting about between
the mother and the daughter-in-law?
[1801.13] I was just asking her why is she going
dressed like this?
[1804.35] She's a new bride, 
she should at least dress up a little.
[1807.99] And I also wanted to say, don’t take
offense to what your father-in-law says.
[1812.18] He's gotten very irritable 
due to his illness.
[1814.39] He's very kind-hearted, 
but his words can be harsh
[1817.83] You understand, right?
[1820.00] - Go, go. Don't stay too long though.
- Right. Come.
[1823.23] - Goodbye!
- Goodbye!
[1825.02] - Give my regards to them.
- All right.
[1841.03] What happened? What are you thinking?
[1843.71] Nothing.
[1852.21] Where are you going? 
This isn’t the way to my house.
[1854.91] Yes, this isn't the way to your house.
[1858.66] Because we’re going for ice-cream.
[1860.94] Mama and Baba are waiting for us at home.
[1863.39] What’s wrong? They’re waiting for us 
at home, not outside.
[1867.23] We'll have ice-cream, 
then we'll go meet them.
[1870.60] Well, I must admit something today.
[1874.37] Husbands are very poor creatures.
[1878.61] Look at me, I haven't made any mistakes,
I’ve done nothing wrong,
[1884.01] in fact, it's me who was mistreated,
[1885.79] but I’m taking you for ice-cream 
to cheer you up!
[1890.92] Shahzar, I’m really sorry
what happened last night,
[1895.03] how I fell asleep so early last night. 
I have no memory of it.
[1898.19] Yeah, that's fine.
[1901.25] You weren't in your senses, 
that's why you slept.
[1904.19] But...
[1906.18] but honestly, I didn’t expect you
to say those things about Mom,
[1910.78] especially on our wedding night.
[1913.19] I wasn’t badmouthing her. 
I was just complaining about her.
[1918.53] But if what happened last night
wouldn't have happened, then--
[1921.71] Look, listen to me.
[1923.71] Stop defending yourself.
[1926.27] You were badmouthing her
and I don't like it!
[1929.39] Shahzar, what? You think I liked it?
[1931.86] That I was complaining about her
first day after our wedding?
[1935.37] I was just thinking that it was important 
to let you know what had happened.
[1939.36] She was upset with me; if I
don't tell you, who else can I tell?
[1943.64] Okay, fine.
[1946.75] But I just want to tell you that...
[1950.01] I'm not only shocked by your behavior,
I'm upset too.
[1954.02] And you're right. There's no need
to go for ice-cream.
[1957.99] You're not in the mood
and neither am I.
[1960.65] So let's just go to your house.
[1974.37] You're her mother-in-law.
[1976.01] She shouldn't even step out of the house
without your permission.
[1979.70] You should tell Shahzar to teach her
the traditions of this house.
[1984.22] There's no need to say anything to Shahzar,
she's a nice girl.
[1988.43] You saw how she stayed
quiet when I scolded her.
[1990.91] I spoke to her when she was
leaving for her parent's house too.
[1994.12] Of course, she'll listen to your quietly.
[1995.69] After all, she's married against
her father's wishes.
[1998.88] Anyway, forget about her.
[2000.51] You should just think 
about Manal's wedding.
[2004.46] Manal? She's too young.
[2006.61] I was thinking of getting some
shares in her name for her future.
[2010.00] You shouldn't worry about Manal,
whatever you do, do it for yourself.
[2014.06] If I don't it for her, 
then who would I do it for?
[2017.15] She's not just your daughter,
she's Shahnawaz's daughter too.
[2020.91] And Manal has as much right
as Shahzar does.
[2025.24] He'll marry her within his own circle, 
according to his status.
[2029.81] You just worry about yourself.
[2031.71] By the way, has Shahnawaz
made any arrangements for Manal?
[2037.60] Only 20% of the property is in Manal's
name, everything else is for Shahzar.
[2042.64] Just 20%?
[2044.39] The government has changed it to 50%.
[2047.32] You don't know Shahnawaz.
[2049.30] He’s doing all this to Manal
just to make me look bad.
[2053.60] But I won’t back down so easily. I’ll
make sure Manal gets what she deserves.
[2058.74] I won’t let any injustice happen to
Manal, even if I have to go to any extent.
[2070.53] Baba, you worried everyone.
[2073.17] You've never had heart problems before,
what happened all of a sudden?
[2079.03] Oh, dear, there are no tensions. I'm
perfectly fine, sitting in front of you.
[2082.94] You're lying.
[2085.12] You don't share any of your worries
with me now.
[2088.19] Remember when I was young, you said
[2089.92] I was not just your daughter, 
but your son as well.
[2093.09] I was wrong.
[2094.81] You're not my son, you're my daughter.
[2100.43] And I'm proud of that.
[2103.72] I'm fine, man.
[2107.01] And Shahzar, son, tell me what is this 
I'm hearing
[2109.55] about you guys canceling the
walima because of my illness?
[2112.78] No, Uncle, it's not like that.
We didn't cancel it, just postponed it.
[2116.52] We'll do it next week, God willing.
[2118.41] You don't think about this,
you're already sick.
[2121.75] Thank you, man. Thanks.
[2124.08] Sweetheart, may you always be happy.
[2126.67] What did the doctors say?
[2128.48] The doctors said you're so healthy, 
you could even handle a second marriage!
[2136.78] Look at this, I'm getting calls 
from the office too.
[2145.64] Rameen, what is it? You know you can share
everything with me, right?
[2152.06] You... you don't look happy.
Did something happen?
[2156.09] You didn't even dress properly.
You don't look like a new bride at all.
[2161.01] Mama, I'm fine!
[2163.53] You're getting worried over nothing.
[2166.49] I'm not worried for nothing,
look at yourself.
[2171.56] Your face is down turned, 
tell me what happened?
[2177.65] Mama.
[2179.45] It's not even been one full day
since I got married.
[2183.72] And you're already asking for reports?
Everything's fine!
[2187.63] Seriously.
[2189.02] Sweetheart, you look like this after
one day—how will you look in the future?
[2194.28] Mama, everything's fine.
[2195.84] You're not hiding
anything for me, are you?
[2201.43] I love you.
