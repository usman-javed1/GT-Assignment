[19.05] By the way, when are you all coming?
[22.22] Shahnawaz has agreed to the marriage
on the condition
[25.55] that you bring your daughter’s proposal
to us.
[32.43] Shahzar, why don’t you understand?
All this is happening because of your dad.
[36.98] Your mom called my dad to say that he came
to your house with my proposal.
[84.00] Sorry, I didn't want to scare you.
[87.01] No problem.
[89.35] What is it?
[92.28] I'm really sorry, Baba.
[100.78] Sorry for what, sweetheart?
[104.91] Things shouldn't have happened this way.
[110.50] Are you happy?
[114.48] That's it.
[117.14] All parents want 
is that their children are happy.
[127.13] My child.
[129.48] My brave child.
[201.39] You know what?
[203.51] The dress I wore today wasn’t made by
a designer. My mother designed it herself.
[210.04] Your mom and your sister really liked it.
[213.28] How did you like it?
[215.77] I don't know.
[217.99] I didn't even see it.
[219.92] I couldn't move my eyes away from you.
[223.83] You know what?
[226.37] I was really surprised today.
[230.04] You looked very beautiful.
[233.13] You don't have an idea...
[235.65] how lucky I feel after seeing you today.
[246.87] You’re absolutely right though.
[251.21] I’ve never been this happy before.
[254.22] Because I was never as happy 
as I was toady.
[258.72] And you know why I was so happy?
[261.76] Because you're about to become mine.
[264.65] What more do I want.
[266.55] Today, I promise I will always take care 
of you,
[271.74] keep you happy.
[275.78] You’ll never regret marrying me.
[282.27] I know.
[287.62] Umar.
[290.11] They're being really hasty 
about the wedding.
[293.61] The want a date within a date. You tell me,
how will everything be ready in a month?
[301.95] We'll prepare somehow.
[304.31] You, however, don't have to go 
to the market.
[307.41] We'll hire an event management company,
they'll do everything.
[312.90] You know how much event managers
charge these days?
[315.49] Their bills go up to lakhs.
We can't afford it.
[319.17] Besides, 65-75 lakhs are anyway
going to be needed for the wedding.
[325.69] How are we going to do it?
[329.67] You don't worry.
[331.33] I’ve got savings set aside for the wedding.
[336.13] And if it’s not enough,
I’ll sell the apartment in Lahore.
[339.93] I won’t let there be any shortage for
our daughter’s wedding, God willing.
[345.80] God willing.
[357.45] The wedding should be grand,
people should remember it for years.
[363.11] We need an amazing venue for
the mehndi and walima ceremonies.
[367.29] Yes, why not, God willing.
[368.92] Do you think we'll be able to get a booking
at a nice place with our limited time?
[373.27] If you take my advice, I think you should
arrange both functions at the farm house.
[378.44] It's huge. It’s much bigger
than a five-star hotel I think.
[381.79] You're right, the plan is nice.
[384.01] I was thinking we can do something
different. Something people will remember.
[390.37] Yes, that's fine. Do whatever you want to.
[393.42] You remember the wedding we went
to Singapore for?
[395.77] What a beautiful wedding! 
The resort was stunning.
[398.89] Yeah, what an event. The pictures
and videos went viral on social media
[404.94] We could also plan
a destination wedding!
[409.04] It’s a great idea, Mom
[411.09] I'll invite all of my friends. We'll have a
lot of fun! I'll create an invitation list.
[415.31] Oh, you've started. 
Shahzar, what do you think?
[418.28] I think it’s a fantastic idea! 
But do whatever makes you happy.
[421.74] It doesn't make a difference to me.
[423.17] Okay, then you take care 
of your bachelor party.
[429.27] All of my preparations are done.
[431.08] I'll confirm with Tabinda if they're
inviting 400 or 500 guests for the baraat.
[436.31] All my relatives live abroad 
so there's no need to invite them.
[442.13] In inquired about the booking.
All the five stars are booked already.
[445.48] I'll see if I can get it at a four star.
[448.45] - Farm house?
- Better idea. Forget about the four star.
[452.43] Farm house with a pool.
[454.58] I want the arrangements to be perfect,
it should be flawless.
[458.68] So that there’s no trouble later.
[463.24] They’ll definitely arrange the
walima for their son at a five-star hotel.
[468.14] We can't compete with them.
They have generational wealth.
[471.61] Mama, Baba!
[473.60] Look! The pictures of our engagement
are featured in the fashion magazine!
[477.37] - Wow!
- Yes!
[479.24] - Look at this.
- Touch wood!
[483.46] - My daughter looks beautiful.
- Whose daughter am I, after all?
[486.79] It's on the front page too. Look.
[488.21] - Oh, wow.
- But who gave it to the magazine?
[491.09] Shahzar said his mother has a
lot of contacts in media and news.
[496.21] so the pictures gets published 
even if it's a birthday party.
[500.22] What's a birthday?
[501.41] They probably send their pictures to
magazines even when they sneeze!
[504.88] When you have so much money,
you don't know what to do with it.
[508.30] I feel like with this show-off behavior, 
people forget about the evil eye.
[513.74] Mama, look how far the world has come,
and you’re sitting here talking about this!
[518.29] - Look, this one is so nice!
- Fireworks! Fire crackers!
[522.29] Tell me if something is left.
[526.44] Oh, you'll be doing Umar a favor.
[529.93] His daughter has won the lottery.
[532.37] That she's getting married 
into such a big house.
[536.90] She is getting married to Shahzar.
[540.32] But she'll never get the status
of a daughter-in-law in this house.
[552.73] I spoke to the event management company.
[555.07] They'll take care of all the arrangements.
[557.91] You don't burden yourself too much
and go running around.
[559.94] Out of the question.
[561.19] I’ve already told you, I’m capable of
preparing for my daughter’s wedding myself.
[565.98] Ammi Ji, do you see her?
[568.01] I’ve told her too. The doctor has advised
rest, but she just don’t understand.
[575.71] Good morning, everyone.
[577.07] - Good morning, dear.
- Good morning, sweetheart.
[578.96] Baba, who are you telling to rest? 
Mama is used to working.
[582.64] Even if there's nothing to do, 
she'll find something to keep herself busy.
[586.98] Yes, she needs a lot of rest.
[589.84] Umar, you've increased your expenses 
so much in name of the wedding.
[594.50] What's the need for such a grand wedding?
[598.00] Oh, we'll know what grand is on the walima.
[601.86] So Shahzar was saying it'll either
be held in Singapore or Thailand.
[605.45] Auntie has been busy with the bookings,
[607.28] so everything will be finalized
in the next 3-4 days.
[610.88] And they're getting it booked for over
500 guests. They'll bear all the expenses.
[617.07] Isn't it a bit too much, dear?
[621.58] Mama, we know how well-off they are.
[625.18] And not just within Pakistan, they
have a lot of property abroad too.
[628.46] In Dubai, London. 
Anyway, forget about all of this.
[630.95] Shahzar was asking for the guest list.
[634.18] So they can get the bookings
for our guests there as well.
[637.50] No, there's no need for that. It'll be
just a few family members. Nothing more.
[641.39] I don't like putting burden on others.
[644.23] Although do let them know that...
[647.53] You tell them...
[650.07] they can bring as many guests 
as they want on the baraat.
[654.83] This is the new fashion,
having weddings abroad.
[661.13] I didn’t know that Shahzar’s
family had so much wealth.
[665.93] It means, Umar, that we should also...
[668.60] arrange the baraat at a five-star.
[671.25] There's no need to follow
in their footsteps!
[673.69] I wouldn't have allowed him to do
all of this even if he had the means to.
[678.38] I don't like showing off at all.
[680.80] Dado, how is it showing off?
[684.34] The competition has
gotten so tough these days
[686.56] that all of this has become a necessity.
[689.88] It's not like that. 
Dado is absolutely right.
[693.36] But, Ammi Ji, she's our only daughter.
We want to do a grand...
[697.19] But, dear, one should not exceed 
their limits.
[700.89] They're generationally wealthy people.
[703.61] We're people who live a life of simplicity 
and honesty.
[707.05] Your father doesn't have
a treasure chest of gold.
[710.46] He's already in a lot of debt.
[715.87] Yes, how are you?
[717.10] Bring Mehr-un-Nisa over
to our house someday,
[719.30] very soon we're about
to become in-laws.
[724.17] Yes, we'll come for sure, God willing.
[726.94] I'm only bothering you now to
discuss the wedding arrangements.
[734.30] Yes, sure. I wanted to talk to you too.
[736.82] Actually, we're planning to have
Shahzar's walima in Thailand.
[740.90] So our list is final for that,
we just need your list of guests now.
[746.27] So tell me when are we meeting?
[762.93] Our guest list will be finalized,
[765.40] and soon as it's finalized, I'll confirm
the booking at the Thailand resort.
[773.04] All right, what are the estimated costs?
[776.88] It's well within the budget.
It's close a million dollars.
[782.07] Fair enough.
[783.89] So have we received the guest list
from Mr. Umar?
[787.77] We'll get it by tomorrow.
[789.37] If you both take my advice,
[791.47] before holding the walima in Thailand,
you should meet Mr. Umar and his wife.
[797.22] Why? Why do we have to talk to them?
[800.76] We're the groom's family. It's our event
and we'll decide where we'll hold it.
[807.98] In this way, they might be
overwhelmed with a sense of inferiority.
[812.13] We shouldn't burden them too much.
[814.97] We're not burdening anyone.
[818.46] We'll do things according to our status,
they should do it according to them.
[825.86] Oh, no, no. How can that be?
Call as many guests as you want.
[830.54] We have no problems.
I just have a small request.
[834.94] Please, no dowry. 
I don’t want any unnecessary formalities.
[839.92] How is it possible that we--
[841.82] You can give your daughter 
whatever you wish.
[844.48] After all, what's a better gift 
than property?
[848.69] Her Mehr is also very handsome, Touch wood.
[851.28] And I plan to give her shares
in the business too.
[853.96] And it's not the time for bed sets 
and sofa sets anyway, you know.
[859.73] There's no need for that.
[861.72] Your financial difficulties 
and financial concerns, I know about them.
[870.53] But I just have a little request that...
[875.27] do something that...
[877.57] we still maintain some respect
among those we associate with.
[884.06] Yes, I...
[886.47] I... I'll try my best.
[890.65] After such a handsome Haq-Mehr...
[893.96] you're transferring property 
in her name too?
[896.10] It's just on paper.
[897.98] It's just to make Umar and Shahzar happy.
My lawyer will handle everything else.
[902.14] Shahnawaz has never given you anything.
[905.06] And you're giving all this
to the future daughter-in-law?
[909.07] But if Shahzar found out about your lies,
he'll turn away from you.
[915.48] No, he won't find out. Everything is fine
for now. We'll deal with everything later.
[919.24] And what's the deal with having
the walima abroad?
[923.08] I haven't gotten any bookings done.
The walima won't be happening abroad.
[926.22] You don't worry. 
You'll find out soon enough.
[928.77] What are you saying, dear?
What do you mean by all of this?
[933.18] Oh, you'll figure it out soon enough.
Just have a little patience.
[935.69] Listen, your cousin's daughter, Maria,
who's here from Hyderabad, invite her too.
[942.51] It'll be fun.
[943.86] Yeah, she's in Karachi these days.
I'll call her.
[950.37] You can give whatever you want 
to your daughter,
[953.03] After all, what's a
better gift than property?
[958.61] Her Haq-Mehr is also very handsome, 
touch wood.
[961.21] And I plan to give her shares
in the business too.
[963.81] And it's not the time for
bed sets and sofa sets anyway, you know.
[970.20] Whatever's happening, it's not right.
[975.00] I'm so helpless.
[979.30] I wish I was able to stop
this wedding somehow, I wish!
[985.04] Tabinda can go to any lengths 
to take revenge from me.
[994.66] There's my daughter's happiness 
on one side, and...
[998.81] sick wife on the other.
[1003.46] What do I do?
[1008.54] The wedding is right out the corner,
I can't even say no.
[1027.86] Touch wood! You look like 
a beautiful princess.
[1031.36] The dupatta is so heavy.
[1032.79] It's so beautiful.
[1033.71] Well, my daughter is so lovely
that anything would look good on her.
[1065.26] I had a feeling from the beginning
[1067.40] that she's doing this to
belittle you and take revenge.
[1072.32] A snake snake like Tabinda will go
to any lengths when it comes to revenge.
[1079.00] I warned you so many times to send 
your daughter's proposal there, but...
[1084.21] What do I do, Amma? 
I had no control over this.
[1086.96] On one hand, 
there’s my daughter's obsession,
[1089.44] and on the other, my wife’s illness.
How can I say no?
[1094.50] If I had my way,
[1096.69] I would've never allowed my daughter to go
into that house or let this wedding happen.
[1100.01] Would you agree to their
unreasonable demands?
[1103.84] Could you arrange so much money?
[1109.08] I’ll have to agree.
[1111.09] It’s a matter of my daughter’s honor, 
her in-laws.
[1115.37] They don’t even know yet
what my financial issues are.
[1120.64] Well, the car is sorted,
[1123.22] and Mehru has already arranged the jewelry.
[1125.73] But calling 800 people for the wedding 
and getting headgear worth 2000 rupees—
[1131.51] that’s just too much, it's wasteful.
Refuse it.
[1136.38] I can't tell them no.
[1139.71] They are doing so much themselves.
[1140.97] They've written so much
for our daughter in her Mehr.
[1144.34] After everything they’ve done, 
I can’t say no them.
[1150.48] It's up to you.
[1152.41] You’re badly stuck in debt.
[1155.90] Have you thought about this? That
apartment in Lahore isn’t even selling.
[1159.73] - Will you sell this house?
- I won’t sell this house.
[1164.65] I'm thinking...
[1166.70] - of putting it in Rameen's name.
- What?
[1169.96] Did Tabinda say this to you too?
[1173.84] No, no. She didn't say that. I...
[1176.14] I was thinking about it myself.
[1177.94] She belongs to my daughter, after all.
[1180.27] Today or tomorrow, I'll have to give it to
her. What's a better occasion than this?
[1332.35] How'd you like the pictures? You saw them?
[1334.80] Very beautiful.
[1336.96] I was thinking...
[1339.12] the girl who looks so
beautiful in her mayon dress,
[1341.63] how stunning will she
look in her wedding dress?
[1346.03] Today, I feel in awe of my fate.
[1348.89] I should be in awe of myself.
[1351.87] After all, I'm getting tied 
to a good person like you.
[1356.23] You're very beautiful.
[1358.90] And I'm very lucky to have you in my life.
[1363.50] You know, before you,
so many girls came into my life,
[1368.91] but I never felt any connection 
with any of them.
[1373.46] I never felt like any of them
could be my life partner.
[1379.57] But when I saw you, 
I knew right away that...
[1383.21] you're the one...
[1386.14] who could spend her entire life with me.
[1391.28] And do you know when I realized 
how important you are to me?
[1395.39] - When?
- The day you attempted suicide.
[1401.13] For a moment, I thought...
[1404.61] I'm going to lose you.
[1407.98] Forever.
[1410.65] But then my prayers were answered,
and...
[1414.45] you're with me today.
[1417.43] Now don't be so over.
It doesn't matter anymore. I'm here.
[1434.50] So, have you found out where the
wedding expenses are being arranged from?
[1438.47] Yes, I’ve found out.
[1440.55] A company is giving them
50 lakhs for advertising.
[1443.64] Right.
[1444.17] In addition, they’ve sent a
quotation to Rizwan and his company.
[1448.57] If approved, it will be
nearly 50 lakh worth of work.
[1454.46] I also learned from my source that they've
already taken a 50 lakh loan from the bank.
[1462.03] Today, their office sent a letter to
the bank requesting a 50 lakh loan.
[1470.04] Okay, I need the bank
name, the vice president's
[1473.58] and president’s names, 
and their contact number right now.
[1475.95] Okay, I'll send you the details.
[1486.95] The wedding preparations are in
full swing, but there’s such a long list.
[1492.11] I’ve been so busy, 
that’s why I couldn’t contact you.
[1495.41] I know, my day has been equally busy.
[1497.48] I’ve been running
around the markets all day.
[1499.01] My complexion has gone so bad, 
I think I’m tan now.
[1503.04] What do you mean? Don't tell me 
you’ve become dark?
[1507.29] What do you mean I've turned dark?
[1510.03] I’ll go for a facial
tomorrow at a good salon.
[1512.75] No, no, no. Not tomorrow.
[1514.65] If you’ve become dark, you should go today.
I’m not marrying a dark girl.
[1519.78] Oh, hello! I’m not marrying a boring, 
grumpy man either.
[1523.23] I like to have some fun in my life.
[1525.25] Really? That's how it is?
[1528.27] Fine, there's still one week to go.
[1530.51] Think carefully decide
[1531.93] whether you really want to marry a boring,
grumpy man like me or not.
[1536.01] Shahzar, our wedding is just a week away.
[1538.89] We have no other option.
[1540.69] We’ll have to spend the rest of our lives 
just tolerating each other.
[1548.93] What are you thinking?
[1551.57] I’m thinking, do I really want to spend the
rest of my life with a crazy girl like you?
[1561.24] - Shahzar, you're crossing the limits now.
- Correction: talk with more respect.
[1565.62] That's how you'll speak to me from now on.
[1568.47] I'm your husband-to-be, respect me.
[1571.87] I should respect you?
Have you ever seen your face?
[1592.50] Yes, I just remembered. 
What happened with that quotation?
[1595.32] Sir, we’ve received a great response.
[1598.27] And, sir, they trust our 
services completely.
[1600.98] - Good.
- But there’s one issue, sir.
[1603.79] Sir, their approval will take a week.
[1609.40] If it takes a week for the approval, 
then the advance payment will take months.
[1614.33] And I really need the money.
My daughter’s wedding is coming,
[1617.91] there are a hundred other problems,
how is all that going to happen?
[1620.50] I’ve done another thing. Look at this, sir.
[1628.43] These are some projects.
[1630.42] There are some companies in Lahore
that I've sent the quotations to.
[1633.25] If their approval comes through, 
it will be great for us.
[1636.55] But, sir, if we get the citrus fruit ad, 
that would be even better.
[1644.22] But all these things will take time.
I need money urgently.
[1647.50] I need some 40-50 lakh rupees.
[1651.18] I’ve already applied for a loan 
at the bank.
[1654.03] Sir, you've already taken
loan worth 7 lakh from the bank.
[1658.58] Sir, I have a suggestion.
[1660.43] If you mortgage the Lahore apartment,
it will be easier for you to get the loan.
[1671.03] I don’t think you have
any other option, sir.
[1684.33] Actually, I need to talk
to you about something.
[1686.52] I think you’re considering 
Umar Hassan’s quotation for the project.
[1694.27] Yes, the one who wound up his business 
and came here.
[1698.43] I need a small favor from you.
[1700.69] Actually, I have a very close friend
whose company has just started.
[1706.41] I was wondering if you could
give this contract to their company.
[1710.18] They're very good. You’ll have a
great experience working with them.
[1714.00] I can promise you. 
This will be my guarantee.
[1717.61] Yes, I’ll make the connection for you, 
they’ll call you.
[1721.21] Just please give them a chance.
You'll be happy working with them.
[1725.21] Yes, this contract-- 
At least consider them.
[1729.67] Thank you so much. 
I'd be very grateful to you.
[1734.41] Anything, anytime, 
if you need anything from me.
[1737.31] Thank you so much.
[1739.18] Yes, okay. Thanks a lot. Goodbye!
[1753.00] Don’t put too much pressure on Umar,
[1756.44] and don’t create so many problems that he
refuses the wedding just two days before.
[1761.66] He’ll never refuse. 
It’s not even a question.
[1764.77] He knows the impact it will have on
his wife and daughter if he refuses.
[1770.46] Anyway, the news of Shahzar and Rameen's
engagement has spread all over the city.
[1775.08] If he refuses now...
[1778.07] all the disgrace and humiliation
will fall on him.
[1781.65] Don’t worry.
[1783.21] The day is not far when Umar Hassan
will fall at my feet and ask for my help.
[1789.20] Maybe that’s when my heart will
feel peace, seeing his helplessness.
[1794.28] Maybe then the wounds his betrayal
caused in my heart will start to heal.
[1803.90] I want to see him suffer in the
same way I have since ages.
[1811.20] That day is not far.
[1814.89] That day is not far.
[1822.54] - What's going on?
- Careful, there are steps here.
[1826.49] - Don't open your eyes. That's it.
- Oh, Mama!
[1828.49] - Don't you know your own house? Careful.
- Okay.
[1830.67] Listen, you can't cheat!
[1832.27] - But what is it?
- You tried so hard to open your eyes.
[1834.41] - Don't open your eyes!
- No, not yet! Not at all.
[1836.21] Don't open your eyes just yet, okay?
[1838.55] Open your eyes.
[1839.81] - This better be good. 
- Yeah.
[1845.13] - No!
- Yes!
[1847.27] - It's mine?
- Yeah, this is for you.
[1850.13] But this is my favorite car!
[1851.70] So, idiot, we're your parents.
We know what you like.
[1856.31] Tell her!
[1857.69] - Isn't this very expensive?
- That's nothing to worry about.
[1861.71] Thank you. You're the best father
in the world!
[1866.13] Oh, my God, thank you!
[1868.54] - I didn't even tell you.
- Yeah, so?
[1871.61] Wow!
[1874.83] - Come, you guys!
- You sit in there!
[1891.87] - What's all this happening, Umar?
- What's happening?
[1896.81] We’ve already spent
more than we could afford.
[1902.15] And then you went and bought
a 30 lakh car for the dowry.
[1906.15] Why?
[1907.27] You were saying you would give
everything for our daughter’s wedding,
[1909.97] that it would be grand. 
What happened to that plan?
[1912.83] I agree, I wanted a grand wedding for her, 
but...
[1916.91] look at our financial situation.
[1922.05] We’ve taken so much loan from the bank, 
we have to pay it back with interest.
[1926.41] How will we do that?
[1927.57] If you listen to me,
I think you should sell the flat right now.
[1930.69] There's hope of something happening,
so I don't think that'll be necessary.
[1933.75] How?
[1934.55] I’m negotiating with two or
three businesses, if we get a deal,
[1938.29] things will work out.
In fact, all the expenses will be covered.
[1943.88] God willing!
[1945.64] I’m sure you’ll get all these projects.
[1949.35] Okay...
[1951.49] There's one more thing 
I was thinking about.
[1954.07] What about?
[1956.78] I was thinking, why not transfer the house
to Rameen's name?
[1964.21] No, Umar. Not right now.
[1966.49] Why? Just a few days ago, you said
we should transfer the house to Rameen.
[1972.47] I still want that.
[1974.65] But now’s not the right time.
[1977.43] What will be a better time that this?
I think this is the perfect time.
[1981.87] Umar, I might not much to live
but you have your whole life ahead of you.
[1987.85] Have some fear of God, man.
Why do you say such things?
[1990.72] I want you to handle home and the business
after I’m gone.
[1995.12] Rameen is still a child and she's getting
married into a nice family, touch wood.
[1999.46] Her husband will give her everything.
[2002.25] I mean, she'll get all the luxuries,
so why should we do it?
[2006.45] Have I ever asked you of anything
for myself?
[2012.38] So think as if I'm asking you today.
[2014.71] My happiness is related to that.
[2019.97] I’m sure you won’t refuse.
[2023.79] Have I ever refused you?
[2027.23] As you wish.
[2103.22] Finally! Haven't you gotten a little fat?
[2107.04] I love all the customs related to weddings.
We’ll do all of them, right?"
[2111.89] - All of them?
- Yes, all of them.
[2114.50] All right, whatever you say.
[2116.10] Tell me, what will you give during
the muh dikhai? (a first look custom)
[2118.43] Is that also a custom?
[2120.69] As if you don't know! It’s the
most important custom. Tell me!
[2123.39] - So I'll have to do it too?
- No, someone else will come and do it.
[2125.81] All right? All right.
[2128.67] I think in order to fulfill your wishes 
and complete all these rituals,
[2132.11] I might have to pull off a big heist.
[2134.49] What?
[2136.42] Why are you pulling my ears, girl? 
Leave me!
[2139.29] Everyone will see and wonder she's
already pulling her future husband's ears!
[2142.11] Yeah, so?
[2180.83] Why are you standing all alone like this?
[2187.68] I hope all the preparations for the
baraat are made as per our discussion?
[2193.96] Yes.
