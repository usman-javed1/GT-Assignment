Shahnawaz is absolutely right. Why is Kamran insisting to get married
so quickly? You should inquire about this guy too. This house is worth 18 corore
and the business is worth billions! I don't want all of this. You must find a way to tell them
to give cash and jewelry to Minal. You’ve chosen your favorite jewelry,
now you’ll have to wear what I like. I mean...  my mom had some family heirlooms, and she wanted to give
them to her daughter-in-law, - so will you wear them?
- Of course I will. Is that even a question? Thank you. Which mall do you want to go to? Kamran, enough. You've
already made me shop too much. Are you planning to buy
the whole mall or something? If it were up to me, I would
lay the entire world at your feet. You’ve done so much for me. 50 tolas of gold is a lot, no king would have given that
much to his wife on their wedding. Of course, you deserve it. I don’t have anyone
else in this world but you. By the way, I talked to
my mom about the dowry. I told her clearly that Kamran doesn't
want anything except me in dowry. But my mom said she would convince dad
to transfer some shares and property to me. In fact, she has already transferred
5 crores to my account. And regarding the property,
that too will be taken care of. What was the need for all of this?
And besides... I have you now. I don't need anything else. As for your dad's property, I’m not
interested, and neither should you be. Okay. Okay, tell me this, where are you
going to take me for our honeymoon? - Wherever you say.
- Okay. We’ll decide on 5 destinations
and choose one. here will be a great package. Maybe we
can go to Paris, Switzerland, New York. I've always wanted to go to Germany. Maybe we can also do a cruise.
I’m just so excited! I always thought I'd like
a grand tour honeymoon. - What happened?
- No, something got in my eye. -  It's nothing.
- Are you alright? Yes, I’m fine, thank you. So, as I was saying... Do you have any specific
destination in mind? - Whatever you say.
- Okay, then. I’ll plan everything. I’m so excited! Wow, Minal! So much shopping, it
looks like you’ve bought the entire market. Kamran loves me so much, he loves me so
much that he’d bring me the moon and stars. I’m very happy for you. I’m really happy,
but I’m worried about one thing, though. Why does he want to get married so quickly?
And that too with so much simplicity? Khala, he is an only child.
He doesn’t get along with his relatives. Maybe he just wants a simple wedding. But he must have some distant relatives,
right? Nowadays, who keeps up with relatives?
That too with distant relatives? But, dear... we'll still invite his relatives
and friends, right? Otherwise, people will talk and say, "Why did Manal get married so quickly,
and why so simply?" If Kamran and I don’t want
a grand wedding, what’s the issue? By the way, Khala, I have a suggestion. All that you were planning to spend
on her wedding, why don’t you just transfer
that amount to her account? You mind your business.
I know what I’m doing. Go inside and do something. I’ve told him so many times not to
talk about these things in front of her. Kamran is like this, Kamran is
like that... The evil eye will fall on us! We don’t believe in all this.
You’re also talking like Phuppo now! She didn’t say anything. She only said whatever you're going
to spend, you should transfer it to me. You know, since my wedding plans
were confirmed, she’s so excited and happy. Just listen to what I’m saying. Okay, let’s unpack the stuff. Look at this! - Look how beautiful it is.
- So gorgeous, touch wood. It’s beautiful, touch wood, so gorgeous. I bought this penthouse last year. And I want... to transfer it to your name
after the wedding. No, Kamran, no. You’ve done so much for me. You just gifted me the farm house
and now this pent house? No. - No.
- What difference does it make? And besides, everything that’s mine
is yours now. And transferring everything to your name
out of happiness. And... what do I have except you? What happened? Why are you looking at me like that? I never imagined a boy
could love me so much. I mean, I'm just an ordinary girl. But still, you love me so much. The amount of love I have for you... I don't have words to express it. Just think that... I can’t even imagine being without you. I love you with all my heart. Thank you. Manal, give me all your jewelry. I’ll keep it in the safe, and
later I’ll keep it in the bank locker. Why do we need to keep it in the bank? I've
to wear it at parties after the wedding. And there'll be dinners too. Kamran said he has a safe in
his farmhouse; I’ll keep it there. No, no, keeping so much cash
and jewelry at home isn’t safe. Mom, I'm telling you. There's no point
to keep it in the bank. Fine, it’s up to you. Just be careful. Yeah, don't worry. I’ve arranged for the fake property papers. And the jewelry – keep it safe. I have to return that jewelry 2 days
after the wedding. Why do you worry, my friend? You'll get the jewelry back on time, and your money too. Do you have any idea how much cash
and jewelry she’s bringing? I've given her 50 tola. She's getting roughly the same
amount of gold from her family. Her father has transferred
about 5 crores into her account. Everything is going according to plan then. What do you think of your friend? I’ve set this trap so well that
her entire family is involved. And that poor Minal. It feels as if I've done
some sort of magic on her. She just agrees to everything. She was so excited about a grand wedding. I said no once,
and now she’s sitting quietly. Listen, I asked you for an ID card. Did you get it made? Your fake ID card will come tomorrow.
and so will the fake honeymoon tickets. Anything else, my friend? I can't wait anymore.
I've waited long enough. Promise me you'll get my papers ready
and call me to Dubai as soon as you arrive. Kamran, you have no idea how excited I am
to go to Dubai. Listen, you've planned
your business, right? We'll buy our apartment there. You'll go to work daily
and I'll cook for you. It'll be so much fun, right? What are you doing here? I thought Minal would be with you,
I came to see her. You've seen she's not here with me, right?
Then what are you doing here? Go. Were you spying one me? Why would I spy on you, Maria? You know how happy I am today? And on this joyous occasion,
I have a small gift for you. What is this? This is the property paper. "Mu Dikhai." Normally, people give diamond jewelry
for mu dikhai... but I didn’t find anything big enough
for your standard. So, here’s a small gift for you. But what is this? Papers for the farmhouse
and the penthouse. As promised, I’m transferring
everything to your name. Come on, sign these quickly so I
can transfer everything tomorrow. Why the hurry? We can do it later. No, Minal, don’t refuse. I’m giving it with so much love. Today, you’re the owner of the farmhouse, and everything related
to me is yours now. Thank you. But I'll sign these papers tomorrow.
All right? As you wish. - Let's go?
- Let's go. Tell me where are we going
for our honeymoon? We're going to Murree for now. I have a beautiful resort there. Then we’ll head to Singapore
and Malaysia. You’ll love it there. I have no mood for Nathiagali right now. We can do this instead,
we can leave for Malaysia next week. Yes, we can go there, but it's important
for me to go to Murree. I bought some land there,
and construction is going on. Plus, you’ll love the resort.
It’s beautiful. Then I’ll definitely go. Should I make something? No. Just sign these papers. I'll sign them. What's the rush? Okay, give. - Where do I sign?
- Here. Just one more. That's it? The house feels empty without Manal.
I’m not used to living without her. Oh, daughters belong to other people. We have to get used to living without them. I'm just amazed at how
did all of this happen. The proposal came, date got fixed,
and the wedding happened. All so quick! We didn’t have time to think. Once they return from their honeymoon,
I’ll invite all our relatives and friends. I'll host a get together.
I want to introduce Kamran to everyone. Your son-in-law is very nice. - I just hope he keeps Minal happy.
- Ameen. Call and talk to her. My heart will feel peace
once I talk to her. Is your packing done? The packing's done.
\I've kept my warm clothes too. But where's your wardrobe?
Everything's empty inside. Yeah, I was just-- Yeah! I used to live in an apartment before. I was a bachelor then.
My entire wardrobe is still there. You're here now and we've shifted here, so
I'll bring my clothes here very soon too. We'll do one thing. On the way back from our honeymoon,
we'll shift your entire wardrobe here. I'll do it. Come on, let's go for a long driver.
I really feel like going. Minal, we'll keep going out and such. We're anyway going for
our honeymoon tomorrow. We have a flight at eight in the morning. Don't you have to sleep? Come on, go.
Go and sleep. Okay, I'll go and sleep. Good night. - So, how's your honeymoon going?
- Very nice! I'm having a lot of fun. And thank you so much
for giving me such a brilliant idea and made me meet a foolish girl
who has a lot of money in her account. Otherwise, how else would I have
received so much money in my account? Tell me truthfully; how much money
is there in your account now? It's a good amount now.
I got her to sign the check very smartly. The poor girl is sleeping.
I gave her sleeping pills last night. Today's the last day. I thought I'd make that poor girl
a little happy. - I fed her with my own hands.
- Be careful! That you don't fall in love with her
while feeding her with your hands. Don't be too frank with her. Love? And that foolish girl? Never. How can someone love such a foolish girl? Such stupid girls are only used. She's very beautiful but what can I do
with her beauty? I only love you. And who am I doing all of this for?
For your better future. Okay, then. I've a flight at 9
am tomorrow, I'm gonna go. Just pray whatever happens,
it happens after I've left. Take care of yourself. And do as we planned. Don't do anything that's not in the plan
and yes! Keep calling me, don't just vanish.
I'll be worried about you. Come on, love. It's just for a few weeks. Just let me reach Dubai. 
I'll call you there as soon as possible. And you know what? I'll buy an apartment in your name. That both of us will decorate 
with a lot of love. Where you and I will live. He hung up. You... What are you doing here? It's cold here, go inside. 
You'll catch a cold. What's wrong? I had an important call so I came out. Go. We have a flight at 8 in the morning,
we'll be late. Go. - Come on, go.
- Where is that flight to? To Islamabad? Or Dubai? Where's that flight to? Minal, we'll go to Dubai.
What's the big deal? Enough! You want to steal from me 
with your girlfriend! You wanted to commit a fraud against me. - You're pathetic!
- What do you mean? What do I mean? What do I mean? I heard everything! Why did you do this to me? - Why did you do this to me?
- There's been a misunderstanding. - Look, I only love you.
- Shut your nonsense. Shut your nonsense! Why did you do this to me? - Minal, it's nothing like that.
- Stop lying! - Listen to me!
- You're lying! Shut up! This is why I was repeated telling you
not to call me! I'm trapped now. But you don't listen to anyone. All because of you. 
I didn't push her on purpose, man. Tell me nothing happened to her, right? She's unconscious inside. If something happened to her,
this matter will escalate to the police. You're not here! You'll run off to Dubai,
I'll be the one trapped here. Why are you getting worried? And I
didn't take your name on the phone either? Right now, I'm only worried about myself. I'll leave this country tonight somehow. You don't worry though. I'll call you there in a few weeks. All right? Okay. Call me when you get there
and take care of yourself. What happened? Is she not picking up? I've been calling for a really long
time now, no one's picking up. Strange. Minal never does this. Come on, it's already very late. 
Is the breakfast ready? How can we go?
They're not picking up. It doesn't seem nice to just go like this. Call Kamran then. I called him too. His number is either off
or busy. I think they must've left for the airport.
They're flying to Islamabad today. No, no. Not the airport. They were supposed
to meet us before they left. They won't go like that.
Minal would've called that they're leaving. - Khala, try once again.
- I'm calling! Listen, you don't have any other number? No, I only have this number.
I don't have the landline number either. It's amazing! You don't have any number of the house
you sent your daughter to. There's a limit to carelessness! You could've taken the number.
I'm not responsible for everything. I feel very anxious. It's been so long, we
haven't spoken to anyone. I haven't spoken to
Minal since yesterday. Shahzar, quickly go and check on them.
What if there's some emergency? Shahzar, come. Let's go and check on them. Yeah, we'll have to check. 
I'll take out the car, please come. Oh, God have mercy! 
Hope everything's all right. I won't spare him. How dare he do something so disgraceful
to my sister? You'll see! Wherever he's hiding, I'll find him! I'll kill him. Minal, you... Minal, you're okay, right? It's been a while since they left. God have mercy. We still have no news. No one's picking up. 
I've called Shahzar multiple times too. Kamran's phone is also off. Oh, God have mercy. What if something has happened
to my daughter? Don't worry, everything will be fine.
One second. Shahzar, where are you? I've been
calling for so long. No one's picking up. Hospital? Hospital? Just tell me if Minal's all right. Minal's completely fine, but... that Kamran... who told us he's the owner 
of Shah Motors... he lied. He's just a lowly employee there,
nothing else. What happened to Minal? - Nothing.
- Tell me what happened to her. - Nothing happened to her.
- Tell me what happened to Minal! - Why won't you tell me?
- What happened to my Minal? - Why won't you talk? Tell me.
- No... What are you saying?
What you've told me is so weird! Anyway, how is she doing now? Mama, she's had a nervous breakdown.
Just pray she recovers soon. I feel really sad 
but all of this is Tabinda's fault. She's a 19-year old innocent girl. Obviously, she doesn’t
know what's good for her. It's easy to cheat a 19-year old kid. Tabinda and her father should've inquired
about him. I've been saying it since then
that it's all very... Anyway, forget about it. Tell me, did you find out anything
about that guy? So far we only know that he's
taken everything and ran off to Dubai. Minal's jewelry, the jewelry he gave her,
he's taking everything and run away. Shahzar has just told me that he's
taken a check of 5 corore from here. He took that too. In fact, the money's
been credited to his account already. Okay, make me talk to Tabinda.
Let me at least ask. Mama, I can't get
her to talk to you now. She's not in a position
to talk, she's crying a lot. And on top it all, Uncle has put
the entire responsibility on her head. Okay, which hospital are you at?
Your father and I will come there. Mama, don't come yet. She
asked me to keep this quiet. I'm only telling you. Just pray
that everything gets normal. Pray Minal gets better.
Everything else is fine. I can understand. Okay, keep me updated. I'll pray for Minal. Good bye. You're absolutely right. But I've forwarded all of his details
to the IG myself. You understand what I'm saying,
right? You know our influence really well. I don't know anything. All I know is 
I want that man behind bars. At any cost. Thank you. I have good news for you.
The patient is awake now. - Can we meet her?
- Yes, of course. We'll take you to meet her 
in a little while. And we'll discharge her 
by tomorrow morning, God willing. Actually, the patient has been through
severe stress. Just try not to talk to her 
about anything that's happened to her. - Yes, of course. Thank you.
- All right? Do you know how happy I am today? And on this happy occasion,
I have a small gift for you. What is this? These are the papers for this farm house
and my pent house. According to my promise, I told you
I'd put it all in your name. From this day on, you're the owner 
of this farm house. And everything that's mine,
it now belongs to you. Quickly sign this so I can put it in
your name first thing tomorrow morning. - Where do I sign?
- Here. Yes, hello! Did you reach safely? Obviously! A storm has to come
once you left. Did they receive the divorce papers? Yes. Really? So what was the reaction of Minal
and her family? Minal had a nervous breakdown. This had to happen. She's not well. And Shahzar has file an FIR against you. Don't talk like children. They can't do anything to me.
They can't even touch a hair on my head. I'm in Dubai right now. And Pakistan's law isn't applicable here. Yeah, I know they can't do anything to you.
You've run abroad! But they have very strong sources. They won't let you go like this. Anyway, tell me how is Minal doing? You're very worried about her. Come on, man! I'm only asking
in the name of humanity. She fainted. She had a nervous breakdown. She's back from the hospital, 
she's fine now. Obviously, this was a huge shock.
This reaction was warranted. Anyway, forget about all of this. Tell me how's everything in Dubai? The journey was lovely. I was thinking about you the whole way. Maria... everything that you've done for me... I can never repay you for that. I love you. And there are no favors in love. Anyway, I'll hang up and go to Khala. All right. Good bye. Okay, we'll talk later. It's shocking how they blindly trusted
a lying and cheating man. I'm still in shock. I can't believe it. Yeah, I was shocked too. It's sad also. I mean, their family is so influential
and he cheated them so easily. I can't believe it! 
He pretended to be Kamran Shah? But the worst part is what Minal
must be going through. This is all Tabinda's fault. Do you remember how arrogant she was being
at the day of the nikkah? She was really showing off 
her husband's and son-in-law's wealth. She was telling everyone that she
has selected a diamond for her daughter. People are right, 
pride comes before a fall Oh, Ammi, forget about it. Let it be. We have a daughter too.
We should be careful about such things. We've a daughter that's
why we're saying this. She has a father and a brother, 
yet no investigation was conducted. They just married off their daughter 
like that. Just handed her over. You reap what you sow. Poor girl. Out of all the properties I have,
this is the one I like the best. This is why I'll put it in your name
after the wedding. What do I do with her beauty? I only love you. And who am I doing all of this for? For your better future. Okay, then. I have a flight
at 9 in the morning, I'll go. Just pray whatever happens, 
it happens once I have left. There's been a misunderstanding. - Look, I only love you.
- Stop your nonsense! - Minal, it's nothing like that.
- Stop lying! - Listen to me!
- You're lying! Shut up! If people found out... that Shahnawaz Malik's only daughter
has been betrayed like this... so I won't be able to show my face
to anyone. He came. And he said that... He was very happy. He was very happy to see Minal's life
being ruined. I'll have to punish him, Mom. I'll find him and punish him. No, you won't do any such thing. I'll take him to the gallows! 
I won't rest until then, Mom. I'll go to the underground to find him,
but I'll definitely get him punished!
