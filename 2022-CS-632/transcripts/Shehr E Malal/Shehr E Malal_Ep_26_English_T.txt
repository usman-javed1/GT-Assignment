[463.48] helped in getting Umar out of jail,
[464.92] what an honorable person he is,

[479.84] why did this happen I am in a lot of trouble,
[482.16] I have also come to know everything about me and
[485.56] Umar Hasan, she doesn't even want to see my face,

[561.76] Shahnawaz uncle has not kept anything in the name of that woman or Manal,
[564.24] everything is in his and
[566.32] Shajar's name, that's why I got this
[568.56] property
[570.20] built so that I can get that old man to
[573.16] sign it in any way, and then tell me what will
[576.40] happen, we both will sell this property and
[578.96] go somewhere far away

[593.04] me, look Maria, I will not
[597.04] leave you, I will not cheat you,

[604.52] who introduced me to my love Manal?
[607.08] You did it. No brother, I cannot
[610.08] trust you. Earlier also, you had left me and went away
[611.96] and did not even check on me. No,
[614.20] I cannot do anything with you this time.

[673.28] take, take it after a lot of thought. Hey,
[678.08] why are you worrying? This time, the
[680.60] plan that I have made has been made after a lot of thought.
[684.16] I will be able to make that woman suffer a lot, just the way
[690.36] she made me suffer. Hey, at that time
[693.04] my hands were tied, that's why I could not do anything,
[695.96] but
[698.60] now I will not leave her.
[705.04] This time I have made such a plan that she will
[708.92] remember that I have already ruined her daughter,
[710.76] now I will ruin her.  The
[714.20] time for destruction has begun
[718.65] [Music]
[742.64] Manal, it is not at all what you are thinking,
[752.00] I had told you earlier also
[754.76] that this
[756.76] man is not worthy of life, but she was
[762.36] not ready to listen to me, on top of that,
[766.36] this deceit of his,
[769.68] Uncle, you are misunderstanding,
[774.56] you left me for this girl,
[778.00] you have ruined my life because of me,
[781.72] no, Manal, there is nothing like that, look,
[784.56] I am bigger than you

[842.88] lie, house, bus, poor man, nothing happens with this,
[846.44] stop this nonsense, I will kill the
[848.00] Koli
[851.95] [Music]
[862.43] [Music]
[870.00] what have you done, hey, shoot me, I did
[873.08] not know, run,
[889.24] run,
[891.00] why are you
[900.81] [Music]
[920.58] [Music] the
[964.24] way we discussed about this case
[966.40] and the way we did it and it was
[969.00] also presented in the court and Umar Hasan is
[971.60] really  He is an innocent man and he did
[974.36] not commit any fraud, he did nothing. Is
[976.64] Baba innocent?
[978.08] Yes
[980.64] son, Umar Hasan was a truthful and honest man.
[986.16] He never betrayed anyone. He never cheated anyone.
[988.92] So son, clear the misunderstanding from your heart.
[991.84] So that case of embezzlement and
[996.52] those two crore rupees that were withdrawn from his account,
[998.52] what is all this? Regretfully,
[1001.76] despite being his daughter, you could not understand him.
[1004.44] You gave him a lot of pain. As for the cheque of two crores,
[1007.92] Banda Malik, in
[1011.80] collusion with the manager of Baker Andes, got Umar Hasan
[1015.24] accused of embezzlement. And not only this, he
[1019.32] also hatched many conspiracies inside Umar Hasan's advertising agency, due to which
[1024.80] that company went into a crisis and had to
[1028.80] suffer losses worth crores.
[1031.16] Why did he do
[1033.88] this? Because of your father had forbidden him to
[1036.48] tell you, but the circumstances were such that
[1039.04] we had to tell him. Son, see all the details in this file.
[1048.24] [Music]
[1065.60] Everything got spoiled because of this woman. Pupu,
[1068.84] I lust my mother because my father is on the streets
[1071.84] and I did not even know about it. I wish
[1075.80] I had believed Baba then.  Then all this would not have happened, I would not have
[1078.36] married Shajar, I am
[1081.44] not Shamin, what happened,
[1085.32] you see, you are not alone in this situation,
[1088.68] I am with you and I am telling you that I will
[1090.92] leave these people, no, no,
[1096.32] I do not accept such a person as my husband,
[1099.04] because of whose mother my whole
[1100.80] family got ruined,
[1102.76] Shajar, your mother manipulated me so much, that I
[1107.00] started hating my dad, I
[1110.04] started hating my father so much, I became so distant
[1112.44] from my father, I am a bastard, son,
[1115.96] listen to me, you are saying absolutely right,
[1119.24] but do not get angry at this time, your
[1122.64] health will deteriorate,
[1125.08] father, please go from here, please
[1128.76] I cannot talk to him right now, I cannot see his face, please go from here,
[1131.96] Raman, listen to Shajar, son,
[1135.24] what is he trying to say, you are not going from here, it is
[1137.32] fine, I will go myself,
[1140.64] Raman, Raman, what happened, you Raman, Ran, are you okay, Ran, thank you, thank you, there is a
[1158.88] severe shortage of blood,
[1162.20] at present, son, you have to do that.  We will put a drip
[1165.04] but will give iron supplements later.
[1167.92] You
[1170.00] see,
[1171.08] what a great news you have received,
[1175.24] thank Allah, son. I will go and
[1177.96] tell Shajar, he will go mad with happiness.
[1180.68] No,
[1181.80] Papa,
[1184.40] please, I cannot spend my life with Shajar. If
[1187.48] this child is born, I will file for divorce.
[1190.80] What are you saying? You have come to your senses too.
[1194.13] [Music]
[1196.28] Hope, I have come to my senses today. I am
[1200.88] not safe in the house where I am,
[1202.88] how can my children be safe? A woman who
[1206.20] killed my mother is responsible for the destruction of my father.
[1209.92] How can she spend her life with her son?
[1212.40] I hate every person and every
[1216.88] relationship that is connected with Ta-Bida.
[1219.16] No,
[1220.76] Rami, it is not like that, son. You
[1225.32] rest now, my daughter, everything is fine.
[1231.52] [Music] Are
[1247.12] you saying the truth? Thank you, thank you, up. Are you
[1252.68] saying the truth? I am going to become a father. I will
[1257.24] go and meet Raman right now. You
[1259.96] cannot meet him. Do
[1262.36] you know the reason?
[1267.12] What is this? How can it be that
[1270.60] someone's actions are punished?  I met him, if there is
[1273.56] any crisis for Raman's family, what is
[1275.16] my fault in it? Look, there is no
[1277.92] use in arguing with him. It is better if you don't go in front of him. The
[1280.52] passing time will make him understand
[1284.08] what is right and what is wrong. And until Umar is
[1286.80] released, she will stay with me.
[1288.96] But you should try to understand what
[1291.76] I am telling you. Understand my point.
[1293.88] Umar is a sensible man. He wouldn't
[1297.60] want his daughter's home to be ruined. And
[1300.68] anyway, she has gone through a very difficult time. The doctor has forbidden
[1303.44] her to take any stress.
[1308.13] [Music]
[1334.56] Who is it?
[1335.90] [Music]
[1346.48] Ramanri I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm
[1353.60] sorry,
[1355.44] Baba. It's a big mistake. [Music] I've made a big mistake. I've made a
[1364.44] big mistake. [Music] Sorry, I
[1376.00] brought you

[1455.22] [Music]
[1464.92] He respectfully,
[1466.92] forgive me, Shajar, I did
[1470.48] n't do anything. Shajar did everything because of that. He
[1472.52] told me to forgive me, Shajar, look, I'm
[1474.24] yours. I'm yours.  Shajar, I
[1476.00] fall at your feet Shajan, please forgive me.
[1478.00] All this was done by him. I didn't do
[1480.32] anything Shajan, I haven't done anything.
[1482.52] Shajan, please forgive me. I
[1485.12] fold my hands to you. He did everything. I didn't do
[1487.00] anything. Everything has happened because of him.
[1488.48] Forgive me Shajar, please
[1490.76] forgive me. I am from my language. Shajar, please
[1494.16] listen to me. Forgive me. I
[1496.44] am your feet. Shajar Shajar,
[1499.04] come on, listen to me. Shadar, come on, no, no,
[1503.40] listen to me
[1506.09] [Music] What is this?
[1520.32] This is
[1531.56] everything that you wanted.
[1536.72] For which you made our lives a spectacle.
[1543.84] I transferred this house to your name.
[1547.40] And some shares of the business
[1550.96] too. What should I do
[1554.34] [Music]
[1559.80] For all this, you played with our lives.
[1563.48] [Music]
[1566.44] This is what you wanted, right?
[1572.36] Yes, I really forgot.
[1576.04] Umar Hassan broke your heart.
[1579.63] [Music] To
[1582.04] take revenge for your broken heart,
[1588.44] you used all of us for that.
[1593.16] I, the fool, kept thinking
[1597.80] that now I will even get revenge from my own mother.  She is giving me so much
[1601.04] love
[1604.22] [Music]
[1607.36] I did not know
[1610.48] that
[1613.36] how much hatred was hidden behind that love
[1616.84] [Music]
[1625.72] Because of thousands of revenge
[1628.76] I lost everything
[1632.30] [Music] While he was
[1633.76] alive my father kept on explaining me
[1638.48] but I kept on hating him I kept on
[1642.60] saying good things to him I never
[1646.08] listened to him
[1648.96] just thinking that he was doing injustice to you I left
[1651.76] my mother
[1658.00] alone
[1661.01] [Music]
[1664.20] But you know that
[1668.28] I am not the only one,
[1672.72] everything has been snatched away from you too
[1681.48] If my father has been snatched away from me then your
[1686.12] husband from you If my sister has been snatched away from me then
[1689.32] your
[1693.52] daughter from you And if today Ran is leaving me then
[1697.56] Umar Hasan has also snatched your heart
[1700.55] [Music]
[1705.72] What can I say to you
[1708.35] [Music]
[1711.96] Because at least I considered you as my mother
[1722.04] Congratulations to you on this deserted and desolate house
[1729.08] Congratulations to your broken heart
[1734.32] And congratulations to the loneliness of the whole life
[1746.48] This heart is that the
[1750.24] desert is deeper than the ocean Who knows
[1759.64] where the pain is
[1764.40] How can I forget those stories that have
[1770.44] passed through my heart No one
[1776.68] knows why this happened to the placenta
[1783.12] Baba  Why do children have to suffer for the deeds of their parents?
[1788.52] In the whole house, she was the only one who took care of me.
[1799.36] I have never seen a sensitive and innocent girl like her in my life.
[1801.20] She was always worried
[1805.52] that everyone is happy.
[1811.04] Despite being so different from your mother, why doesn't she do all this with her?
[1820.00] Son, understand that every person
[1825.08] cannot take even one breath above the life that he has written for himself. I wanted to
[1833.68] tell you a good news. It is a
[1836.92] very good firm. It is a company from where
[1839.64] I have been offered a job. They are paying a good salary. It is a
[1843.28] good package. Yes, they are
[1846.00] also offering a furnished apartment.
[1848.40] This issue will also be resolved.
[1851.16] We will have to shift there soon.
[1854.52] You stayed here for so many days. They took
[1858.04] care of you. It is a
[1859.60] great favor of theirs. We have a very good
[1863.00] woman.
[1865.00] But son, Shajar has also helped us a lot. I
[1872.44] want to say one thing. If
[1875.88] you don't mind, then I would like to
[1884.64] say that son, Shajar is a good boy. Forget
[1889.20] whatever happened and go to your home with Shajar.
[1893.56] This cannot happen.
[1897.88] We travelled so much because of that woman.
[1901.36] I have to leave her.  I can never forgive you
[1903.15] [music]
[1913.36] Shajar loves you, I tried to convince you again and again,
[1917.24] but you did not listen to him even once.
[1921.20] You should listen to him,
[1925.24] son. I know all this. I
[1929.84] know how much he
[1932.36] loves me, but despite all this, I do
[1934.64] not want to live with the person
[1936.08] because of whose mother my
[1939.08] family has gone through such a journey. I
[1941.20] lust my
[1944.16] mother. Your heart is very big, baba.
[1948.72] I am not that strong. I cannot
[1950.52] forgive
[1954.44] him, son. One does not need strength to forgive.
[1958.64] We are forgiving others,
[1963.00] but in reality, we are achieving the happiness that is hidden behind this forgiveness. The virtue is
[1972.40] in forgiveness,
[1976.20] son. Please forgive me. I am in a lot of pain. I was
[1982.56] crying a lot, pleading, asking for forgiveness. I
[1988.20] feel as
[1991.00] if she has lost her mental peace as well. Please
[1994.92] forgive me, son.
[1997.92] Which person can remain normal after losing everything? Whatever a
[2005.64] person says, it hurts him. She is suffering for her
[2009.68] own deeds and she will suffer for the rest of her
[2012.80] life.
[2014.92] Whatever she has done, she will suffer for the rest of her life.  I have given it to them, don't I?
[2018.12] Even God will not forgive them
[2022.83] [Music] Be
[2062.48] careful and
[2065.68] forget how those stories have passed, those stories which have happened to my
[2071.76] heart, no one knows
[2080.02] [Music]
[2086.60] My child, my life, how lovely she is, she has
[2090.76] gone exactly like you.
[2096.24] Uncle, I have
[2098.24] thought of a name for it.
[2101.04] How does Meru sound like Meru to Nisa,
[2107.60] I have also thought of a name,
[2112.00] Manal, what kind of a name is it?
[2114.52] [Music] A
[2120.48] good
[2124.52] name. If you keep this name, then
[2129.52] I am very happy today.
[2131.88] I feel as if all the
[2135.00] happiness of the world has come together and come into my lap [Music] No
[2146.48] one is attacking my heart, please
[2153.80] come inside.
[2159.12] Life has faded away on my breath
[2164.40] [Music]
[2168.80] Thank you, thank you so
[2174.56] much
[2176.41] [Music]
[2179.16] Congratulations, oh please sit down, why are you standing? I have to
[2183.88] go for a very important meeting
[2187.64] [Music] I
[2197.56] should go, we will not meet again.
[2215.44] Come back to our life
[2218.80] [Music] We have been
[2222.00] homeless, upset, where have we gone, we have lost our
[2231.48] way, whom should I tell about my condition?
[2236.24] My heart
[2243.48] is homeless, my heart
[2248.84] is homeless
[2252.23] [Music]
[2258.47] [music]
