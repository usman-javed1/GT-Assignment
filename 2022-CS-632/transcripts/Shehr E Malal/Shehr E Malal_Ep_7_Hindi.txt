Oh, we'll know what grand is on the walima. So Shahzar was saying it'll either
be held in Singapore or Thailand. Auntie has been busy with the bookings, so everything will be finalized
in the next 3-4 days. But I just have a little request
that do something that... we still maintain some respect
among those we associate with. Yes, Mr. Gondal. This is Mr. Gondal Mehr,
Vice President of Mehr Estate. Oh, touch wood! And this is Shahzar’s father-in-law,
Umar Hassan. - Salam.
- Oh! Hello, Mr. Umar. - How are you? Nice to meet you.
- I'm good. - Salam.
- My wife. I see, right.
By the way, what do you do? I have a business; I-- He manages his father-in-law’s business,
and he also have a small advertising firm. I see. What was your father-in-law’s name? - Yes, it was Manzoor Hussain.
- Manzoor Hussain? It's the same Manzoor Hussain the one who,
18 years ago, - passed away due to a heart failure?
- Yes. Yes, he was a very
close friend of my father's. He had a very big business. I’ve heard the business collapsed,
didn’t it?  What happened though? He was a well-known figure,
Manzoor Hussain. Running a business
isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, and if you can’t handle it properly,
it gets shut down like that. But it’s very sad. I’m really sorry to hear that.
So sad. I really dislike Tabinda. I really hated some of the things
she has done. What does she think of herself? I mean, did you notice how she insulted us
in front of everyone? She treated me like a maid.
Such a rude and disrespectful woman. I’ve never seen such a rude woman
like that in my life. I’m really worried about my daughter.
I mean, just think, how is this poor girl going to deal
with her tricks? Poor girl, a tough time is coming. Umar? Are you okay? The new project... it's very important for me. Please pray that I get it. God willing, this project will be yours. I know. lately you... have been really stressed. I’m sorry, I’ve been selfish,
caught up in my own issues. Please don't worry. Salam, sir. Where have you been? I’ve been looking for
you since morning. You didn’t report to me. What happened with that Rizwan & Co.? - Did they mail you or something?
- Sir, I have a bad news for you. Rizwan and Co. have finalized
a deal with someone else, and the Citrus Fruit people have also
signed a contract with another company. What? How is this possible? I just-- I spoke to them just yesterday! Sir, this is a 100% report!
Look, here’s the email copy. Sir, look, they’ve canceled it! - Sir.
- Oh, God. Sir? Sir, I’ll take the car
and head to the hospital. - No car. I've a lot of work to do here.
- Sir? Please, sir, let’s go to the hospital.
Please, sir. I’m fine. - Just get me some water.
- Okay, sir. Please go quickly. In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious,
the Most Merciful. Umar Hassan bin Umar Hassan, your nikah to Shahzar
Malik bin Shahnawaz Malik is solemnized with the
haq mehr of 50 lakh rupees. - Do you accept?

Do you accept? - Yes, I--

- Yes, I-- I accept. - Nano?
- Yeah? I've looked everywhere
and you're standing here. Come, we have to take pictures. - Come.
- Come, come. I was looking for you
since so long. - Oh, I was just here.
- I looked there, I looked here. Yes, yes. Yes, Salam. Yes, I understand your point, but... but please wait a few days.
It’s my daughter’s wedding today. No, no, I’ll pay you back for every penny.
Just give me some time. Look, you-- Yes, I understand your situation,
but... You know in business, money
can’t just be withdrawn immediately; it will take some time, right? Please trust me. I’m telling you. Yes, yes. I understand your point. Yes, all right. Umar. Where are you lost? I was standing on
the stage, signaling to you since so long. I was watching my daughter. She looks so beautiful, right? Touch wood. Our daughter is the most beautiful bride
in the world Now, it’s time to bid her farewell. Are you ready? Yes. I'm ready. So, tell me, are you ready
for the rukhsati? - We are.
- So when? - I'll ask and let you know.
- Hurry up a little. - Mehru.
- Yes? They're asking about the rukhsati. - I came to call Umar for that only.
- Yes, let's go. Let's go. Where's Baba? Baba! Baba, what happened to you? - Umar! Umar!
- Call the ambulance, quickly! - Please--
- Umar! Call the ambulance! - Baba, what happened? Please get up.
- Call the ambulance, quickly! Umar! Umar! Umar! - Please call the ambulance.
- Umar! Umar, my son! Umar! Careful. - Mama, I'll go with Baba! Please.
- Rameen, please. Your rukhsati just took place. - You go with them. Rameen, please!
- I can't just leave him like that and go! Please! Rameen, I'm going with uncle. Trust me, nothing will happen to him.
Trust me. Come on. Come sit in the car. Auntie, why did you snatch my phone? No, no. What's wrong with you? She's not snatching it. She'll return it
in the morning. It's okay. Why until morning? Look, girl. Stop crying.
It's considered unlucky. And mourning like this on the day on
the day of your wedding? It's very wrong! Do you understand? Nothing like this ever happened
in our family! May God have mercy on our house. Auntie, please give me the phone back. I
need to ask about Baba’s health from Mama. It'll be bad if you step into this house
with this sorrowful face! Step into the house with a smiling face.
Do you understand? And you call Shahzar
and call him to quickly come home. I'll call him. Come on, you come in
and rest. Relax a little, we'll call them.
I'll speak to Shahzar. Come, come. Good. Here you go. I've got this for you.
Eat something. You didn't eat anything. - No, no--
- Please, please. - Where's Auntie?
- She's inside with Umar. Don't worry; everything will be fine. Please pray. - I pray to God that my son recovers soon.
- Yes. Oh, Rameen, you're crying? Shahzar's just about to come.
Are you going to welcome him like this? Maria, please let me speak to Shahzar. I don't know how Baba's doing,
what's happened to him! How is he doing now?
Please let me speak to Shahzar once. Oh! You still haven't spoken to Shahzar. How would I speak to him?
Auntie snatched my phone! Please help me. Please. Just let me speak to Shahzar once.
Call and ask him yourself. I spoke to Shahzar. He said your dad's
in a very serious condition. They might have to spend the night
at the hospital. Maria, please tell me the truth.
\What has happened? Oh, you don't worry. Drink this juice.
I'll make you talk to him right away. I don't need anything. Just tell me
what has happened to my father! I'll get you to talk to him.
Don't worry. Here, drink this juice. Come on.
Come on, like good girls, come on. You have to finish the whole thing,
come on. Why isn't she picking up? What did she say? You don't worry. Uncle will be absolutely fine. God, have mercy on us. I told you to give her a sleeping pill
and put her to bed. Don't worry. I've done everything. I've put her to bed, changed her
clothes, and removed her makeup - She won't wake up before morning.
- All right. Poor Shahzar. His excitement will vanish
when he sees his wife sleeping. Okay, hold this. It's Rameen's phone.
Put it on her bedside table. And come to me after this, I have to
talk to you about something important. Okay. Go, go. Quickly. - All right.
- Shahzar's about to come. Quickly go. What's wrong, Rameen?
Why aren't you picking up? Mr. Shahzar, the doctor is calling you. Let's go. Rameen. Rameen, wake up. It's morning. Rameen. Wake up. It's morning. Oh, man? Rameen, everyone's waiting for us
for breakfast. Wake up. Rameen! Where's Rameen? She's still sleeping. She'll wake up
in a while and come. I'll call her. I tried but she didn't wake up.
She's in a very deep sleep. You eat your breakfast. Oh, let it be. She must be tired. There's a million things to do before
a wedding. She must be exhausted! Khala, what kinds of things to do? Besides, I didn't even see her dowry. No, no. It's not like that. They wanted
to give her a dowry, I told them not to. Mr. Umar was really insisting on it,
but I said no. This won't happen. They did give her a car and the
functions was also beyond my expectations. She's their only daughter. And Umar Bhai did all the arrangements
himself. Because they've married their daughter
in a respectable family. How is he doing now? Yes, he's much better than before. I just spoke to Auntie. She said they'll discharge
him before evening. I think I should call and inquire
about his health. Then I have to invite them for the walima
as well. That won't be needed.
I've canceled the walima function. Did you cancel your walima? Shahzar, your father-in-law is so sick. In this situation, it doesn’t feel right
to go abroad and celebrate. But we made so many arrangements
and sent out invitations. We paid the advance.
The booking is already done. Why are you getting worried?
I'll handle it. I spoke to the travel agent, 
the tickets are canceled, and my secretary will personally
call everyone today to apologize. There won't be a walima. What’s this, Mom? You canceled the plan? 
I was so excited! Look, right now, we need to think about
Rameen's family more than our own happiness. She’s a part of our family now, 
we have a relationship with them. Mom, really, after doing this, 
you’ve won my heart. Anything for you. Next week, we will host a memorable
event to celebrate the joy of this wedding. and invite our friends and family. 
We’ll celebrate then. This is good, right? Come on, now. 
Fix your mood. Grump! Rameen! Rameen, get up, it’s already 11!
What's wrong with you? Get up! It’s morning? Yes, it’s morning, and you’ve
been sleeping the whole night. How's Baba now? Don’t worry, he’s fine. I stayed with him in the
hospital the whole night. I expected you to call and check on him, but you didn’t even pick up my calls. I don’t understand, it was our
wedding night, and you slept through it. I would’ve called
if I had my phone. - Your grandmother took my phone.
- What nonsense! - Why would she do that? 
- You should ask her this. Shahzar, you kept saying that your
dad had a problem with our wedding. But I think your mom has a problem
with us. She hates me! - Mom doesn’t have any issue with you!
- She doesn’t like me! If my mom had a problem with you, 
you wouldn’t be in this house right now. If she had a problem,
she wouldn’t have supported you. She wouldn’t have convinced Dad. As for your phone... so here. This is your phone. Which, apparently, Nano took from you. Shahzar, I’m not lying, and-- I just know that on our wedding night, 
and you were sleeping. Your dad was in the hospital,
I was with him, and you kept sleeping. That's it! Listen, I’m really sorry, I honestly don’t even remember when I fell 
into such a deep sleep. Please take me to see Baba. Fine, I'll take you in the evening.
Right now, everyone's waiting you outside. Shahzar, he suffered a heart attack
yesterday on our wedding day, please take now. Fine, I'll take you. I'm getting ready, you get dressed too. Are you going somewhere?  Oh, I was going to meet Baba 
to check on his health. His health is better, but good, 
you should definitely go. But how are you going like this?
Your parents will be worried. Your mother is sick, 
and your father is too. What will they think
seeing you like this? You're a new bride.
You should dress up more. At least in the early days, right? I just wanted to say something, 
think of it as an advice. You’re newly married, 
it’ll take some time to adjust. But if you want to see your in-laws
and your parents happy, just try to avoid discussing your in-laws
at your parents' house, and vice versa. You understand, right? You’re smart. You guys are going then? What is this meeting about between
the mother and the daughter-in-law? I was just asking her why is she going
dressed like this? She's a new bride, 
she should at least dress up a little. And I also wanted to say, don’t take
offense to what your father-in-law says. He's gotten very irritable 
due to his illness. He's very kind-hearted, 
but his words can be harsh You understand, right? - Go, go. Don't stay too long though.
- Right. Come. - Goodbye!
- Goodbye! - Give my regards to them.
- All right. What happened? What are you thinking? Nothing. Where are you going? 
This isn’t the way to my house. Yes, this isn't the way to your house. Because we’re going for ice-cream. Mama and Baba are waiting for us at home. What’s wrong? They’re waiting for us 
at home, not outside. We'll have ice-cream, 
then we'll go meet them. Well, I must admit something today. Husbands are very poor creatures. Look at me, I haven't made any mistakes,
I’ve done nothing wrong, in fact, it's me who was mistreated, but I’m taking you for ice-cream 
to cheer you up! Shahzar, I’m really sorry
what happened last night, how I fell asleep so early last night. 
I have no memory of it. Yeah, that's fine. You weren't in your senses, 
that's why you slept. But... but honestly, I didn’t expect you
to say those things about Mom, especially on our wedding night. I wasn’t badmouthing her. 
I was just complaining about her. But if what happened last night
wouldn't have happened, then-- Look, listen to me. Stop defending yourself. You were badmouthing her
and I don't like it! Shahzar, what? You think I liked it? That I was complaining about her
first day after our wedding? I was just thinking that it was important 
to let you know what had happened. She was upset with me; if I
don't tell you, who else can I tell? Okay, fine. But I just want to tell you that... I'm not only shocked by your behavior,
I'm upset too. And you're right. There's no need
to go for ice-cream. You're not in the mood
and neither am I. So let's just go to your house. You're her mother-in-law. She shouldn't even step out of the house
without your permission. You should tell Shahzar to teach her
the traditions of this house. There's no need to say anything to Shahzar,
she's a nice girl. You saw how she stayed
quiet when I scolded her. I spoke to her when she was
leaving for her parent's house too. Of course, she'll listen to your quietly. After all, she's married against
her father's wishes. Anyway, forget about her. You should just think 
about Manal's wedding. Manal? She's too young. I was thinking of getting some
shares in her name for her future. You shouldn't worry about Manal,
whatever you do, do it for yourself. If I don't it for her, 
then who would I do it for? She's not just your daughter,
she's Shahnawaz's daughter too. And Manal has as much right
as Shahzar does. He'll marry her within his own circle, 
according to his status. You just worry about yourself. By the way, has Shahnawaz
made any arrangements for Manal? Only 20% of the property is in Manal's
name, everything else is for Shahzar. Just 20%? The government has changed it to 50%. You don't know Shahnawaz. He’s doing all this to Manal
just to make me look bad. But I won’t back down so easily. I’ll
make sure Manal gets what she deserves. I won’t let any injustice happen to
Manal, even if I have to go to any extent. Baba, you worried everyone. You've never had heart problems before,
what happened all of a sudden? Oh, dear, there are no tensions. I'm
perfectly fine, sitting in front of you. You're lying. You don't share any of your worries
with me now. Remember when I was young, you said I was not just your daughter, 
but your son as well. I was wrong. You're not my son, you're my daughter. And I'm proud of that. I'm fine, man. And Shahzar, son, tell me what is this 
I'm hearing about you guys canceling the
walima because of my illness? No, Uncle, it's not like that.
We didn't cancel it, just postponed it. We'll do it next week, God willing. You don't think about this,
you're already sick. Thank you, man. Thanks. Sweetheart, may you always be happy. What did the doctors say? The doctors said you're so healthy, 
you could even handle a second marriage! Look at this, I'm getting calls 
from the office too. Rameen, what is it? You know you can share
everything with me, right? You... you don't look happy.
Did something happen? You didn't even dress properly.
You don't look like a new bride at all. Mama, I'm fine! You're getting worried over nothing. I'm not worried for nothing,
look at yourself. Your face is down turned, 
tell me what happened? Mama. It's not even been one full day
since I got married. And you're already asking for reports?
Everything's fine! Seriously. Sweetheart, you look like this after
one day—how will you look in the future? Mama, everything's fine. You're not hiding
anything for me, are you? I love you.
