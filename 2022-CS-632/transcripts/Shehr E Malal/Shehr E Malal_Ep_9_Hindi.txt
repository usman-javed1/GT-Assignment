Look, try to understand.
This is a huge business. And I'm one who has to
look after the factories now. Dad's been on the wheelchair
for the last 20 years. And mom has handled this business
in his place. But now it's time for me
to fulfill my responsibilities. Shahzar, I don't have a problem with you
going to the office. I'm only saying that you went
on the second day of the wedding. That's what I'm saying.
Why don't you understand? I had a very important meeting
otherwise I wouldnâ€™t have gone. Anyway, forget about it. Stop being angry and let's go outside
with me. Everyone's waiting for us at the breakfast. We'll have breakfast. But before that, there are a few
important thing I have to discuss with you. I have some grievances with you,
some complaints. I have a lot of grievances
with you too. I was also very upset but did you try
to make it up to me? No, not even once. Did you even try to listen to me once?
Try to understand me? - What grievances? What have I done?
- Man, forget about it! If I started talking,
it'll take the whole day. No, no, no. You tell me. Let me see what your mom has said
to provoke you against me. What did you say? You think my mom provokes me
against you? I don't think she does, I know! I have figured out her reality
in just two days! I can't believe it. I can't believe how wrong I was
and how right Dad was! Dad was right about you,
and about your family background. You know what, Rameen? You don't deserve me. Nano has cancer, and... - Why didn't you tell me about it?
- She told me not to. She doesn't want to become a burden
on anyone. And please, don't tell your dad. Otherwise he'll think that I'm wasting
his money on Nano's treatment. Dad can think whatever he wants. I don't care about that. As for nano's treatment,
you don't worry about that. I'll bear all the expenses
of Nano's treatment myself. In fact, if we had to take her abroad,
I will. No, no. That's not the real issue. What I'm really worried about is... how do I tell Nano to leave the house? Why would she leave the house?
Why would you say that to her? She has lived with us her whole life,
why would she go now? Look, Dad can think whatever he wants. All the expenses of her treatment
will come from my account, so dad should have any problems either. Whenever you need the money,
please let me know. Sir, you didn't do right by us.
Specially with me. I had such great offers but I came here
because you called me. Look, I know you weren't treated fairly,
but... but the company also has some constraints. Sir, you remember your problems!
We're poor people too, Mr. Umar! Look, you... You're an intelligent, sensible man.
You're honest. You'll find a job anywhere! I know that really well! But the time I've wasted by coming here,
I'll make sure you pay for it! As per the contract,
I am entitled to a salary for the 6 months. - I won't leave it on any condition!
- Guard! - Don't think I'll spare you.
- Take him away! Fine, go away from here. I'll be after you until the very end
and take all that I'm due! Why'd you sell a flat worth 4 crores
for 2 crores? Mehru, nobody was offering more than that. I had no option to save the flat
and sell something else. I needed the money immediately. That's why I had to make this decision. No, you're right. Don't you think that if we had waited
a bit longer, we might have received a better offer? You're right. But we were unable to wait. The company employees
are going to the court. If they had gone to court, we would
have had to go through the courts, and they would have
dragged us into the courtroom. Otherwise I would had to beg another friend
of mine that I could get more loan. I don't think that was appropriate. The building's rent for 6 months and... and the clients' dues... I still have to arrange more funds. Karachi didn't suit us. I don't know who cursed us... Our business was doing so well,
everything was working out. This is a wretched city. Don't tell Rameen anything and
don't discuss it at her in-laws' either. She's a very sensitive girl. She'll get upset and get worried. I don't want it. She's newly married... let the two of them be happy. We'll see everything later. God! I got so worried when Shahzar
spoke of her cancer! Oh, thank God I'm perfectly fine. Your Khala had all the plans to kill me
in motion. No, Amma, it's not like that.
I hope you live even my years. I only lied to soften Shahzar's heart. And they say if you lie for a purpose,
it's not really a lie. I mean, something that doesn't harm anyone. Yeah, you're right, Khala. And besides, what difference is her cancer
going to make to anyone? I think you should go to your room
and prepare for the assignment. Amma, she insulted me in front of Shahzar
today. She said she doesn't know anything
about computer. Do a few courses! She's busy on Facebook the whole day. Yeah? And then he says she doesn't know
how to work the computer. Khala, you called me here
to spy on Shahzar. You have a lot of other people
to work the computers. I can't do all of that. Really? Then how are you going
to spy on him? I've hired you as his personal secretary. If you'll stay around him, do his work,
then you'll know what he's up to. Okay, then. I'll charge extra for this. Look, you're paying me the monthly salary, but there'll be extra commission
for these extra things. Stop it, greedy woman! Amma, I think we should send her back.
Back to Hyderabad. She was fine there. Oh, no, no. She'll learn.
She's still a girl. Are you still upset with me? Look, if we kept fighting
each other like this, then... - this car won't run smoothly.
- Which car? Mom told me that a husband and wife
are like 2 wheels of the same car. If one doesn't work,
everything falls apart. Shahzar. Please don't give the examples
of your mom. In the last few days, I've realized
the importance of your dad in this house. - What do you mean by this?
- You know exactly what I mean. The fights and the bitterness between your
parents, even the servants are aware of it. So please. Don't give me the examples of their love
and understanding. Rameen. Man, I was giving you their example. I'm only sharing her point-of-view
that she shared with me. And yes, you're right. My parents do have a lot
of misunderstandings. But did you ever ask me the reason
behind it? After Dad's accident,
he started feeling a complex. He used to argue with Mom on everything, and maybe that's why
he acts the same with you. No. Uncle's behavior with me is perfectly fine,
I have no issues with him. - Then what is it?
- Shahzar, please try to understand. Sometimes Auntie's behavior with me
gets really weird. Look, she's not what she appears to be-- I don't want to argue
about this any further, Rameen. Why are you so against my mother? Why should I have to explain
to you how wonderful she is and everything she's done for this house? I understand that for you she's merely
your mother-in-law. But to me, she's everything. Listen. Shahzar, I'm sorry. Look, I didn't want to hurt you. I was only trying to tell you the reality. And not just this,
there's so much I want to say to you. - But please fix your mood.
- All right. Just... just forget about it. I also wanted that... everything gets normal, but... Get ready and come.
I'm waiting for you in the car. She's getting a bit too out of hands.
I'll have to subdue Maria. She so blatantly told me that she's
going to charge for everything separately. Don't give her a single penny. And the diamond bracelet you've given her,
take that back as well. Is she worthy wearing diamonds? God, she's such a blackmailer.
You know what she said to me? I just couldn't imagine! She said she would help turn Shahzar
against Rameen, but there's a condition. She said marry me to Shahzar
after all of this. - How dare she!
- Come on! Has she seen her face? She'll get married to Shahzar. As if!
Shahzar's status is way high! She doesn't even look at girls like her. - What else did she say?
- Oh, forget about it. Let it be. Just tell me how do I get rid
of her? I regret calling her here. Take her hand and throw her out. What else? She won't leave us so easily. We've only been married for three days and you're already
behaving like a typical wife. I don't understand what your problem is. You think I'm being a typical wife? Shahzar, you're my husband. If I won't share things with you,
then who will I share it with? If I won't talk to you,
then who will I talk to? Okay, fine. Tell me what is your problem with
my family? What are your complains? I have no problem with your family. There are some people like your nano,
your cousin Maria. They make me uncomfortable.
They say really weird things at time. Man, it's just for a few days. She'll shift to the hostel then.
She's my cousin, she can live in my home. As for Nano, she's an old woman! At her age, she doesn't know what she says. And beside, she's a cancer patient! Like your mom, she's also fighting cancer. You should be more understanding of this,
be more supportive. All right. I understand Nano's point-of-view. I'm sorry but I can't tolerate your cousin. You know why Mom sent me home
early from the office today? Because she wanted me to spend time
with you. With you. She called and scolded me, saying I haven't
given you any time since we got married, and she's right! I was so busy with work,
I didn't even think about you. But she's the one who made me think
about it. She told me to take you out,
take you for dinner, talk to you! And you have ill-thoughts about her. I mean, come on. Think about it yourself. Please. Clean your heart for her. And... where's your bracelet that I gave you?
You didn't wear it today? Now let me explain. Yesterday, at the breakfast table, when Maria saw my bracelet,
she really liked it. And at that moment... Mom made me take off my bracelet
and she gave it to her. Mom? One... one minute. You didn't gift Maria
that bracelet yourself? Am I mad? Who told you I gifted it to her?
My "mu-dikhai" gift? No... no one. I felt like it. Just a thought.
Do you want to eat something? Excuse me. What are you going to eat? This bracelet is exactly like the one
that I gifted Rameen. She gifted it to me. This... Rameen gifted it to you? Yeah, yeah. She gave it to me
in front of Khala. You can call and ask if you want. She's a lovely girl. We became such good friends
in such a short time. I tried to refuse, but... she gave me such an expensive gift
just like that. She said it's a little old-fashioned.
I'll ask Shahzar to get me a new one. She forcefully gave it to me. I was thinking that... I should wind up the business.
I should find a job. Job? Yeah, man. A job.
Is there any other option? Umar, don't you think that... finding a job at this age
would be easy? Job isn't related to age. Job are related to experience
and I have a lot of it. You've handled a business all of your life. Now you're going to struggle for a job
at this age. I'm still a young man, what's
wrong with me? I'll struggle a bit! He's right. My son isn't that old. Besides, if he won't get a job, then how
is he going to bear the home expenses? No, Ammi, I meant how is he going to work
under someone else? Child, if he's not used to it yet,
he will be. Besides, Umar has worked jobs
his entire life. It's a different thing how his status
changed when he married you. We're still not used to all these luxuries. I'm only worried about one thing. How are we going to bear
expenses for your treatment? This worry is killing me. Good morning! Are you guys awake yet?
Can I come in? Sure, sure. Come in. Please. Where's Rameen? Call her.
Look what I've got for you, Rameen. Rameen. Look at this! Come, come. Quickly come. Look at this. These are our familial jewels. My mother-in-law gave it to me,
and today, I'm giving it to you. Come on, hold it. You have a right to these. No. Now, you have a right to these. In fact, on this house too.
You're the owner of this house! - What you'll say will happen.
- No, Mom. You're being unfair now. You can give her all the jewels you
want, but you'll only control this house. Don't come in between a mother
and a daughter. A mother and daughter? That or a
mother-in-law and a daughter-in-law? Daughter! I've brought her here
as my daughter. Wear it and show me. Wear it. Wear it, come on. Touch wood! They look so beautiful. And here you go! Your bracelet. The one you gave to Maria
as a joke. I thought you must've taken it back
from here. But you didn't understand our prank.
I've scolded her too now. She was sitting with your bracelet
since the last two days. Come on, quickly come for breakfast. - I didn't know it was a prank.
- All right. I'll believe you
that had a misunderstanding. But please don't exaggerate it now.
Finish this matter. And one more thing, Rameen. If you want to make me happy,
then keep my mother happy. Because if you upset her... then I'll also be very upset. Come on. Everyone's waiting for us. Khala, if you wanted to take that bracelet
back, they why did you give it to me? Maria is right. And you gave her all the jewelry too! Oh, Amma! I only did it to show Shahzar.
I'll take it back. How are you going to take it back? I'll tell her it's not safe. I have to keep
it in the locker. The situation isn't safe. She's very clever. Just like Umar. Greedy. You don't worry. I know. I was thinking we should
be a little nicer to Rameen. She tells every little thing to Shahzar
and she incites him against me. How do you know she incites him
against you? Shahzar's mood was off since the last few
days. He wasn't speaking to me properly. So I figured. That whole bracelet thing? We'll have to be smart about what we do. Because I don't want Shahzar
to be wary of me. And, Amma, you're not going to
say anything weird in front of Rameen. Oh! Another new drama. Am I scared of someone?
I'm not scared of anyone. I say whatever's in my heart. Whether someone likes it or not. Amma, explaining something to you...
And you should be careful too. I don't want Shahzar to have any doubts
on you. Oh, Khala, don't you worry. I'll do exactly as you've asked.
There won't be any errors. But you didn't do the good thing
by taking that bracelet. I liked it so much.
It had so many diamonds. If you like diamonds so much,
so here you go. Keep my diamond ring with you. Here. What does this woman want me to do
that she gave me her finger ring? Kh... Khala, one-- Can I ask you something? Tell me. Do you have some animosity
with Rameen's family? That is none of your business. Don't ask me any foolish questions anymore.
Mind your business, understood? The ring is very beautiful, Khala. It must
be very expensive! Such a huge diamond! Look at this. It's very beautiful. Look! I see it, I see it. I see everything clearly. Umar, who are these people? What are they doing at our home? They came from the bank. The came to inspect the house.
They wanted to check the papers. They want to see how much the house
is worth, and how much will it sell for. But why? - I'll tell you later.
- Not later, Umar! Right now! Tell me right.
What else is left to sell? What do I tell you? What do I do? I'm already very worried. Don't bother me! Do I harm myself or... or should I die? Get free of all these problems in one go? Hello! Hi! You're back early today. Why? Didn't you like me coming early? No, it's not like that. I'm just thinking
that a workaholic person like you, how did you think of coming home early? It's because I know my wife gets upset
without me. Somebody will see. So what? Let them see. We're married. Why are you being so romantic? I'm romantic since day 1! But I had a good news,
so I thought I'd share it with you. - Let's go out for dinner tonight.
- Sure, we'll go for dinner. But what's the reason for this joy? Because honestly, this is the first time
I've seen you so happy since our wedding. - Really?
- Yes! I found my love, I found you. What can make me happier than that? I've decided! From toady onwards,
no more fights, no more arguments! Life is very short and very beautiful. And I want to share this beauty 
with you. - Remember this.
- Always. The weather is nice, right?
The breeze is lovely. What are you looking at? I'm looking at Rameen. 
She looks very happy. She got a little scared by your behavior
at the beginning. And then her father's illness
also worried her. But look at her now. Your gentleness
has really made her glow. Did you see Shahzar? He's so happy. It's just for a few days. 
Just wait and watch. Oh, no, no. You don't have to do anything. Fate is doing a lot with him already. I've heard his business has shut down. He'll have to mortgage his
house to the bank too very soon. But Rameen didn't let us know
anything about her family. She never said anything to her in-laws. It's possible she doesn't know either. But soon, she'll find out everything.
These things can't remain hidden. Maybe now she'll think twice
before talking about me to anyone. Look at Manal? She's so happy
with her sister-in-law. She's gotten a little too attached. I don't like their closeness. I think you should keep her on a leash. In fact, quickly find a good proposal
for her and marry her off. No, no. She... she's too young. Oh, it's better to marry off 
such naive girls quickly. Why? She studies in a college with boys
and they know her father is a wealthy man. What if someone tricked her 
and she made a wrong move? What then? Hello, Rameen! How are you? Oh! Are you still upset 
about that bracelet thing? It was a silly prank. You got so serious. It's all right. So finally! This bracelet is back
to it's rightful place. Well, honestly, this bracelet only suits
your fair and beautiful wrist. And why won't it look nice?
Shahzar gave it to you with so much love. And why would I take 
your mu-dikhai present? That's why, whatever happened,
think of it as a prank and forget about it. And, look... we're going to have to live in
this house together all our lives. So why don't we become friends? Time will be spent nicely. Look at her attitude. I'll see her! The loan from the bank... is almost 10 coroe rupees. This house is worth the same, but... technically, I still have three years... to repay the bank loan. But since I don't have any means 
of earning now... how will I pay it back? And the bank is aware that we've shut down
our business. This is why they're after us. Why don't you talk to someone? Take help from a friend or something. - Or maybe hire a lawyer.
- How can I hire a lawyer, Ammi? The lawyers that are required for
such cases charge close to 30-40 lakh. How can I pay such a handsome fee? I don't know who cursed
our joyous home. Where are we going to go? We'll move to a cheaper neighborhood,
find a smaller house on rent. Yes, one more thing. Rameen shouldn't know about this situation.
No one should tell her anything. The house is in her name. She's going to have to sign. And you can't hide it for very long. No, I didn't put the house in her name yet.
I was thinking about it. The power of attorney is in her name,
we'll need her signature. My daughter is very sensitive. She'll be done for once she hears 
about her parents' downfall. That's why I'm telling you 
to tell her everything on time. We'll tell her once the time comes,
we'll tell her. They're preparing for a reception now.
How can I tell her now? She's newly married. Let the kids be happy for a few days. They'll know soon. Your mother was diagnosed with cancer
and you didn't even tell me? I wanted to tell you, but you know. Your blood pressure gets high
the moment you hear her name. You don't like her living here either. I'll make arrangements for her
to be somewhere else very soon. No, no, Tabinda. You're wrong. Look, Shahnawaz doesn't have any objections
with your mother living here, but... he's just worried about the privacy
of his home. Privacy? Because of my mother? If that is so, then you shouldn't
interfere in our personal matters either. You know his views really well.
About my mother and my family. You've been hearing it for years! How are you talking to my sister? Do you know how much older she is from you?
She's like your mother-in-law. And my mother? She has no status 
or position. If a mother-in-law is like a mother,
why do you keep insulting her? And I never considered your aapa
to be my sister-in-law. I've always thought of her 
as my mother-in-law. Before you lecture someone else on manners,
take a closer look at yourself. Shut up! - Otherwise, I--
- What are you going to do? Divorce me? And you'll send me where I come from
to this grand palace? It's been years since I've been listening 
to these threats. I no longer care! Yes, if I left this place,
then you'll definitely care! Your son doesn't care about you. If I left, you'll be empty handed. Get lost! Remove yourself from my sight! - Everything's good at home?
- Yes, Dado, everything's good. Any problems? Any issues? Whenever I come here,
you ask me these questions. Do I look happy to you? You do look happy but the horror stories you've told us about
your mother-in-law, obviously... Ma, every house has some small issues. Small? - What did she do with my child?
- The next day of her wedding, she was so rude to her, her mother-in-law. Dado, it was my fault. Because of which,
I got a little scolded. Otherwise, believe me, 
Shahzar is an amazing husband. Seriously. And your mother-in-law?
How is her behavior with you? How mothers-in-law behave. Mine is very nice! - Look, don't lie to me.
- Come on, Dado. Listen to me. Uncle and Auntie are very nice to me,
very sweet. Specially Manal. She's so nice, we've become friends. 
Honestly. I'm happy! My God! - Is she telling the truth?
- Seems like it. Be happy! You just don't want to believe 
your granddaughter. Come on, I mean. I'm happy.
Everything's fine. You have any idea what's going on
at your in-laws? Why? What happened? I've heard their company has gone bankrupt the bank loans are so high that
they'll have to mortgage the house. Who told you all of this?
Is this true? It's true! It's strange that Rameen
didn't tell you. I don't think Rameen knows anything
about it. But she has gone to her parents' place
today, she'll probably knows now. Oh. Did she ask you before she went? Yes, yes. I dropped her.
It's her mom's birthday today. Oh, right. I think we should meet Rameen's family. They could need our help. I'll try to make sure they don't
have to mortgage the house. That's great. Let's do one thing.
Let's go over to meet them tomorrow. We'll meet them and bring Rameen
back with us too. Yes! Anyway, take a look
at these cards. It's for the annual dinner. Select one. How can I select it? You always do this. No, it's a little special this time. Shahnawaz and I were thinking of hosting
a small reception to celebrate your wedding and invite our friends and family. But then we thought of hosting the
annual dinner and reception together. - That's a good idea.
- Right? Not bad. Anyway, take a look. 
Select which care you like. I liked the beige one. Yeah, I think...
this one is according to Rameen's taste.
