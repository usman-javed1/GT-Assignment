[19.06] What will you do? 
Will you give me a divorce?
[20.42] And after that, will you send me to the
place I came from to this grand palace?
[24.56] Your son is not in your control.
[26.54] If I leave here, you will be
completely left with nothing.
[29.45] Who will cast an evil
eye on our happy family?
[32.52] Where will we go?
[34.12] We'll move to some cheap neighborhood,
rent a small house?
[37.86] Everything should be perfect today 
for Mama.
[40.66] God, I can't wait for her to see this.
[42.80] Shakira Baji, after making the cake, 
please help me with the cooking.
[47.49] I want everything to be perfect for Mama’s
birthday. I’m making it with my own hands.
[51.93] Bibi, the madam has let me go as of today.
[56.81] She has settled our dues too.
[61.96] No one will be coming in come tomorrow.
[66.65] Shakira, Ammi Ji is calling you.
[69.93] Mama, she says you’ve let everyone go.
[73.08] That’s fine, they are all lazy people.
[76.01] What's the point?
They just want their salary, right?
[78.57] That's all these people want.
[80.41] And now Ammi is here, so there will
be no problem in the kitchen. She'll help.
[85.77] As for doing the small tasks, that's fine.
I'm going to have fun.
[89.89] Are you going to clean this huge house
all by yourself? What are you saying?
[94.09] You can barely cook one meal. 
Please take care of your health.
[98.09] Dear, there's nothing wrong with me.
By the grace of God, I'm perfectly healthy.
[102.39] Anyway, tell me, when is Shahzar coming
to pick you up?
[106.66] - Why the hurry to send me away?
- It's not like that.
[110.64] Your dado has planned to invite Shahzar 
and his family for dinner.
[114.88] So we should decide the menu.
[118.19] Mama, it's really up to you,
but I think this is a bad idea.
[121.04] You're not letting any servants go.
That's it!
[123.61] - I think it’s a fantastic idea.
- No.
[127.34] You want some help?
[128.10] No, I don’t need any help. 
I will manage. You rest.
[132.79] Lovely girl.
[146.32] Today I tried making a pineapple cake. 
I hope you like it.
[150.94] Happy Birthday, Mama! I love you so much.
[155.20] Thank you very much.
[157.68] Thank you?
[159.09] What’s with all the formalities?
[162.52] I celebrate your birthday like this 
every year.
[166.19] But now that I’m married, 
things are different.
[170.11] "Thank you. Sorry, dear. Thank you, dear."
[173.25] Okay, by the way…
[180.58] Mama.
[183.87] Why are you crying?
[188.80] - What happened?
- No, just felt like it.
[193.53] What happened? What’s the problem?
[197.09] Are you sure?
[198.51] Come, let’s cut the cake.
[200.24] No, how can we cut the cake?
Let Baba come first.
[203.34] No, Rameen. Rameen...
[205.83] He’s very busy today, 
he has a lot of meetings.
[208.60] He'll get disturbed if you call him, 
he’ll be angry.
[210.99] What kind of business is he doing
that he’ll miss such an important event?
[214.44] Today, he forgot your birthday.
Tomorrow, he'll forget your anniversary.
[217.46] - Let me call and ask where is he.
- It's no big deal.
[220.11] What do you mean it's no big deal?
Relax.
[222.97] I’m just calling his secretary
to find out where he is.
[229.92] Go and stop her.
[233.07] Go, go, go.
[234.13] Hello, hi, how are you?  
Please let me speak to Papa.
[242.66] What do you mean?
[246.28] The company shut--
[253.86] No. No one told me anything.
[282.47] We didn’t want to worry you, 
so we hid this from you.
[288.90] I don’t understand.
[291.04] You people have turned me into a stranger
ever since I got married
[295.46] So much happened with you guys
and no one told me anything.
[299.28] You were newly married.
[301.17] This is why we didn't want to tel you
something to bad and bother you.
[305.34] And your father also said
not to tell you anything.
[310.62] This is a mess.
How will all these problems be sorted?
[315.84] You don’t need to think about this.
[318.30] Your Baba will handle everything. 
He's here.
[320.56] What is he going to handle?
[322.61] He has lost everything. 
What is left for him to handle?
[325.57] It’s not your Baba’s fault.
[328.17] You have no right to
talk about him like this.
[331.41] What do you mean it’s not his fault?
What do you mean?
[334.81] He been handling everything 
for the last 25 years, right?
[337.37] These problems must be his doing.
[340.18] I swear I don't understand you guys.
[354.28] I want to tell her the truth.
[369.93] You told her everything. 
I even told you not to.
[374.91] Umar, what did you think?
[377.12] How long can I hide such a big
thing from her and for how long?
[380.72] - As long as--
- Baba!
[383.47] Why did you take so many loans 
from the bank?
[386.27] Rameen.
[388.05] What palaces and factories have you built
that you took such big loans from the bank?
[393.00] What kind of tone is this with your father?
[395.77] Mama, please stop.
[399.28] He took advantage of your silence
his whole life.
[402.11] - He sold nana's entire business.
- Behave yourself.
[406.38] Nana gave you everything along
with his daughter and what did you do?
[411.06] - Go to your room.
- I won’t go .
[413.33] I won’t go until he give me answers
to my questions.
[416.17] What answer do you need?
[418.54] Why did he do this to you?
[426.22] Now I understand.
[429.39] You have done a secret second marriage,
right?
[434.99] Mama, I think he’s having an affair
[447.29] If you ever said something so vulgar 
about your father...
[452.35] I'll ban you from coming over.
[457.65] Do you understand?
[470.72] Child...
[489.95] You're organizing Shahzar's reception
with the annual dinner?
[495.29] Tabinda, you made the right call combining
Shahzar's reception and annual dinner.
[502.24] Look, no one has time for these gatherings.
[505.32] This is a very stupid decision.
[507.79] What are the people gonna say?
[509.35] People will mock us for this reception.
[511.84] A billionaire like Shahnawaz...
[514.28] he's done his son's reception 
with so much simplicity and stinginess.
[519.46] This is all... this is all her doing.
[522.79] She must be thinking of saving money.
[525.56] I have no interest in your money.
[527.88] his is your house, your everything. 
It’s your son.
[531.54] Do what you wish.
[533.21] I never cheated you.
[535.21] Keep everything with yourself.
[539.00] This woman is such a big liar.
[541.71] Why do you do this, Shahnawaz?
Unnecessary arguments.
[545.64] She was in such a good mood.
We all sat together after so long.
[549.97] At least you shouldn't talk like that.
[552.65] You're my sister.
[554.34] Fine, I'm your sister 
and her sister-in-law.
[557.56] And as your sister, 
I'll talk to your first.
[562.26] If your behavior with her isn’t good,
she'll take both children and leave.
[568.16] You can sit here alone 
and stare at the walls then.
[576.90] What’s the need for the reception, 
especially at the company’s annual function
[583.18] Big people will be there.
[585.99] You want to introduce them
Rameen and his father to such people?
[590.86] Aren't they going to establish connections
with these people then?
[594.17] No, Amma. They already have connections.
[596.78] But don't forget when a person’s
status changes, their circle changes too.
[602.16] You'll see, Umar Hasan will get
no importance there.
[604.88] They won't even pay him any attention.
[606.61] His downfall is already known.
[611.05] I arranged this so that Umar
Hasan knows his true place.
[617.85] Do you understand?
[619.68] Very good.
[621.57] That's more like it.
[625.24] No. You've given the warning,
but that is not enough.
[628.94] Give them one week to
vacate the house. That’s it.
[634.27] It'll be really good if it happens before
the annual dinner. In fact, it should.
[638.46] Yes.
[639.89] Please. This has to be done.
[643.57] And if there's anything I can do
for you, you know I'm always here.
[648.36] I'll be waiting. Thank you so much.
Good bye.
[655.00] Yes? Yes, tell me. What did you find?
[658.12] I have the entire report.
[660.48] Mrs. Umar and her mother have over 1 crore
in jewelry, and about 10-12 lakh in cash.
[671.30] They have two brand new cars
[675.03] and jewelry worth 50-60 lakh
that they've given to Rameen,
[679.82] and the car? You know about that.
[683.10] Find out how much they have
with all these assets combined.
[689.74] And do this urgently.
[691.67] It's a very easy thing to do. Very easy!
Your Mamu is here.
[696.32] Yeah! I--
[700.99] That brand new car...
[702.66] It'll be done, it'll be done. 
Why do you worry?
[705.85] It's my dream to have a brand new car.
It's very fun to sit in that.
[716.62] Promise me you're not going
to pay attention to what Rameen has said.
[721.88] She's still a kid, and...
[723.81] we hid everything from her and
now that she knows, she's in shock.
[729.11] I know.
[730.98] She's kid, she's in shock, so...
[734.07] What's the point of minding what your
kids say? I don't think any parents do.
[739.98] But what can I do about that tone
that pierced my heart?
[746.50] It's hurting.
[749.56] A daughter thinks her father is at fault.
[753.65] - She thinks he's a cheater, a fraud.
- Umar.
[756.48] What does it matter what she says?
[759.09] I trust you blindly. Is that not enough?
[764.16] Please. Forget everything she said.
[768.62] - Okay.
- Promise?
[772.64] Umar, Mehr-un-Nisa.
Shahzar and his mother are here.
[779.38] Why are they here at this time like this?
[781.21] They're not here just to take Rameen back,
[783.82] they've also come to give condolences 
for what has happened.
[786.89] What?
[790.69] - How do they know?
- Such things can't remain hidden.
[793.87] When the whole family knows, 
they must've found out somehow.
[798.78] Anyway, I'll get the tea prepared with
Rameen. You go and give them company.
[804.84] Yes.
[806.65] It was really sad to hear all of this.
[809.83] But things happening like this,
the bank didn't even you time...
[816.36] Who can delay what fate has written?
[819.40] When bad times come, 
nature closes all the doors itself.
[823.60] Don't know who cast evil eye on us.
[826.85] Everything got sold off in a matter of
seconds, a running business shut down.
[831.75] Whatever happened, it wasn't good.
[836.17] I can understand your pain.
[839.18] But...
[841.14] Everyone goes through good and bad times.
[843.85] If you ever need any help,
we're here for you.
[850.58] Yes, Uncle. Mom is right.
[852.97] Think of me as your son. Any help you need,
do let me know.
[858.50] No, my child.
[861.40] You two...
[863.30] just stay happy. What could
make us happier than that?
[872.62] It's family that support you 
in your bad times.
[877.00] Please don't hide anything from us
thinking
[882.70] If you need financial help, we’re ready.
[888.95] Yes, sure. Thank God the times
aren't that bad yet but thanks a lot.
[896.83] Just don't lose courage. God willing...
[900.19] this time will pass too.
[901.74] Tabinda, we're not the people
who lose courage.
[905.32] This is just money. And times change.
[908.62] You face even bigger crisis in life.
[913.00] I came to get Rameen. Quickly get ready,
we have to pick your walima dress.
[921.88] Walima?
[924.10] Did you postpone the date for the walima?
[928.38] Yes, we postponed it, 
but this isn't the walima.
[931.05] We're organizing a small reception
to celebrate the wedding.
[935.16] It's a small reception. 
This is the invitation card.
[940.64] Whoever you want to invite,
we've got cards printed for them.
[945.22] - Give it to them.
- Sure.
[958.39] Food smells really good.
[960.22] I feel like eating everything myself.
[964.14] If anyone doesn't want to eat it,
it's up to them.
[967.71] It's very sad though.
[969.57] Minal tried to make you eat,
but you didn't eat.
[973.07] But anyway, I've decided to
sit here all night if you don't eat.
[978.82] - You're very stubborn?
- I know, right?
[981.59] You're no less.
[984.40] No one will be worse than me 
if you go on a hunger strike now.
[988.05] - No one is worse than you anyway.
- Really?
[996.22] It's very hot.
[998.85] All right, thank you.
[1002.15] Umar...
[1004.10] so you've decided to get a job?
[1007.54] Yeah, there's no other option.
[1010.59] I don't even have enough money
to establish a small business or something.
[1015.69] I think job is fine. I should get job.
[1019.54] - But--
- Don't worry. Why do you worry?
[1025.15] Look, I promise not to disturb the
lifestyle you're used to, God willing.
[1031.53] Umar, do you not know me?
[1034.71] I don't care about money or status?
[1039.00] I only have one concern that...
[1042.79] the financial bankruptcy
we're facing right after Rameen's wedding,
[1047.07] I don't want her to be humiliated
at her in-laws because of us.
[1052.34] Look, somethings are going to happen
in the beginning.
[1055.13] But they'll eventually forget. 
They'll get used to it.
[1057.97] - Don't worry.
- God willing.
[1060.60] Oh, I forgot to tell you
something important.
[1063.90] Shehryar is coming from Islamabad 
with his wife.
[1066.95] Shehryar who? Your cousin?
[1069.38] I thought I'd let him know
about our financial situation
[1073.06] so he won't be caught
off guard when he arrives.
[1075.61] He knew it already.
[1081.05] Then they must've said a lot of things 
to you.
[1083.81] Your uncle was against
our wedding anyway.
[1085.88] He wanted you to marry
the same cousin, right?
[1089.04] Umar, why are you talking 
about such old things?
[1093.14] He's happily married now. 
He coming over to meet us.
[1099.18] Are you searching for jobs?
[1101.24] No, I'm just making my CV for now.
I'll look for jobs later.
[1110.04] Big thanks for your offer.
[1112.21] But I know my parents' nature.
[1115.31] Forget taking financial aid 
from my in-laws...
[1118.89] they won't even take it 
from their son-in-law.
[1121.68] Plus they're very strong.
[1123.97] I know Baba can handle this situation.
[1126.68] Yeah, but you can suggest that he take out
a loan from our company for a short time.
[1131.77] Coincidentally, we do have a marketing head
vacancy at the firm right now.
[1139.01] If Uncle wants, he can take up
that job as well.
[1142.09] I'll talk to him if you say so.
But I know he won't agree.
[1147.78] Okay, I have one more solution.
[1149.81] The car and the jewelry you brought,
give it back to them. Maybe it'll help.
[1156.14] Shahzar, try to understand.
[1158.74] My parents won't ever take the stuff
that they gave me.
[1163.17] Their loss is in billions.
[1166.63] Then what's the solution?
How can we help them?
[1170.42] Look, I know you're parents 
are very self-reliant.
[1173.46] And I really appreciate that.
[1175.43] But they need us right now.
[1177.23] I think you should convince him
to take this job.
[1181.19] In fact, this is what Mom wants too.
[1185.45] - I'll talk to him.
- Okay.
[1188.61] Okay, I'll leave.
[1190.14] - Okay, bye.
- Bye.
[1194.48] Rameen, you keep your advice to yourself
and tell it to Shahzar too.
[1198.41] We don't need any advice from him and his
family. We'll solve our problems ourselves.
[1202.75] Mama, if you have issues with
Shahzar's offer, then accept mine.
[1207.35] Look, if you sell the jewelry or
take it back, you'll get some savings.
[1213.39] Rameen, we don't need your car
or your jewelry.
[1216.67] But I'm returning both of these things
to you.
[1218.77] Now it's up to you if you want to use it
or sell it off.
[1222.22] Are you mad? Are we going to take back
your dowry?
[1228.48] And the situation isn't so bad.
[1231.02] Your Baba has gone to find a job,
he'll get it, God willing.
[1234.83] Please don't to me about him.
I'm very upset with him.
[1238.80] Why are you upset?
[1240.83] What has happened to you, Rameen?
[1243.36] Who has filled your head with so
much poison against your father?
[1247.68] You weren't like this.
[1248.99] Honestly, Mama, I don't under what
kind of magic Baba has done on you.
[1253.60] I mean, you find some good
in everything he does, even bad things.
[1256.99] He's brought you on the road.
Everything is over!
[1259.90] - You’re still taking his side!
- Shut up, Rameen!
[1264.65] You listen to me carefully.
[1267.43] If you ever said anything against 
your father,
[1270.45] forget about meeting you,
I won't even talk to you.
[1273.25] Do you understand?
[1275.76] Mam--
[1284.43] I just returned from Germany 
a few days back.
[1287.85] I've started a joint-venture with
a German company back there.
[1293.29] Trust me, when I heard 
about your situation,
[1297.71] I canceled all the meetings 
and came running.
[1302.53] Let me know if there's anything I can do 
for you.
[1304.90] Both of you have come to our home,
this is more than enough for us.
[1309.44] He was so worried all the way here.
He was really worried about you.
[1313.77] In fact, he was saying we should
take you to Islamabad with us.
[1321.31] Yes.
[1322.88] What's left here anymore? 
Everything's ruined.
[1327.81] Besides, we have a huge business.
[1331.95] We'll also take advantage 
of Umar's abilities.
[1335.31] I anyway need a marketing manager
for a new project.
[1343.96] That...
[1346.36] Thank you so very much, but the issue is,
we...
[1349.90] we can't move to Islamabad.
[1352.58] Yes, Umar is absolutely right.
[1355.51] Rameen's is married here in Karachi.
She's our only daughter.
[1358.16] How can we leave this city?
[1361.14] You've married Rameen
in a well-off family, right?
[1367.77] Or did she also fall in love with
a middle-class man like you did?
[1377.40] Rameen has married 
in a very good family.
[1380.36] Being wealthy is indeed their plus point,
[1383.16] but we don't form relationships
based on status or wealth.
[1386.57] Oh, Auntie, you've taken offense.
Shehryar didn't mean anything by it.
[1390.90] I came here to do my duty
because we're family.
[1394.36] If you dislike my offer so much,
then I'll take my leave.
[1398.48] No, no. Why are you getting upset?
[1401.68] What we mean to say is...
[1404.19] Umar is very highly qualified.
He'll find a job in Karachi, God willing.
[1411.70] Excuse me. I'll go and check 
who's at the door.
[1424.78] How can you do this?
[1426.41] We still have a few months left
before the deadline the bank gave us.
[1430.87] We've been ordered by the bank
to have you vacate the house, sir.
[1434.22] Here are the official documents. 
It's the notice.
[1445.68] We'll also have to take both your cars
into our possession.
[1452.60] We're taking the cars today.
[1454.64] But you only have 10 days
to vacate the house.
[1464.01] But I’m telling you, I’ll personally
bring the cars in a day or two.
[1469.76] I'm so sorry, sir.
We have strict orders from the bank.
[1473.19] We can't do this.
[1474.99] I'll be right back.
[1487.65] Umar?
[1490.41] Why are you arguing? Give them the keys.
[1496.50] All right.
[1499.77] I'll bring the keys.
[1519.37] This one is very beautiful, Mom.
[1522.55] Everything is just so perfect.
[1525.26] You still haven't seen 
your reception outfit.
[1527.37] It is beautiful!
[1529.23] You were at your parents' place
that's why I couldn't take you,
[1532.97] otherwise you should've chosen it.
[1535.02] No. I completely trust your choice.
[1537.41] You've selected it. 
I'm sure it'll be beautiful.
[1541.52] Not just beautiful, very beautiful.
[1544.38] Mom has had the most expensive designer
of Pakistan design your dress.
[1548.81] It's not a small event. 
It's my daughter-in-law's walima outfit!
[1552.64] It's not a trivial matter.
[1554.28] I want you to look so beautiful that
everyone admires Shahzar's choice.
[1561.14] That he has chosen 
such a beautiful life partner.
[1565.20] Thank you so much for everything, Mom.
[1567.76] Thank you for what?
[1570.00] I think it was my misunderstanding
that I was unable to understand you.
[1575.57] Shahzar always praises you so much.
[1578.74] Now I know why he respects you so much.
[1582.27] I just want the two of you to be happy.
I just want that.
[1586.81] And listen, you...
[1590.47] Don't worry about your parents.
Once this reception is done,
[1594.60] then we'll sit together and find
a solution for this problem, and...
[1598.26] I'll do whatever I can for them.
[1602.39] You don't worry.
[1604.21] This means a lot. Thank you.
Thank you so much.
[1656.20] You ruined your entire life
for a stranger.
[1659.37] You ruined everything,
but you still didn't learn anything?
[1661.84] Shehryar, please.
[1663.37] You both are in my home right now,
[1664.95] and I won't hear a single word
against my husband.
[1667.82] You always did whatever you wanted,
and we remained quiet.
[1671.29] We never interfered 
in your personal matters.
[1673.78] You gave your entire property
to Umar after Chacha Jaan's death?
[1676.86] How did you trust him so blindly?
[1679.79] What are you trying to say?
[1681.54] That our financial bankruptcy
is because of Umar?
[1684.93] Because his mistake or negligence?
[1688.09] No, no, no.
[1689.55] You're in this condition today
because of his cunning nature.
[1693.22] Why do you trust him so much anyway?
[1695.62] Because he's my husband.
[1697.52] If I don't trust him,
then who will I trust?
[1700.47] You can't trust someone
just because he's your husband.
[1703.44] He has to be a good person too.
[1705.88] And we're sad that you didn't choose
a good life partner for yourself.
[1709.91] But, Bhabi, I consider myself very lucky.
[1713.54] I can't find a better life partner
than Umar.
[1717.09] When I was diagnosed with blood cancer,
[1719.55] and Shehryar returned the engagement ring
to my father,
[1723.31] it was Umar who took my hand, took care of
me, and looked after my father's business.
[1728.51] Did we die that you handed the entire
business over to Umar and sat home?
[1732.09] Did you see my condition back then?
[1735.16] What do you think? I should've taken care
of the business then?
[1738.46] What did I know about handling
a business?
[1740.39] My father trusted Umar.
[1743.17] I married Umar because my father said so.
[1745.88] And I'm very happy with my decision.
[1748.72] You don't look happy at all.
[1750.60] Have you seen your face?
[1753.28] Remember how you were before? Look at
yourself now? You've completely withered.
[1757.51] This is what happens with blood cancer.
[1759.77] How do you think I should look?
[1762.49] I've been battling this disease 
for years.
[1765.53] Umar has spent all the money earned
from the business on my treatment.
[1769.63] By taking me to Europe.
[1771.27] Fine, I believe half of the property
was used in your treatment.
[1774.44] What about the rest of Chacha
Jaan's property? Where did it go?
[1777.47] Mehru, tell us. Where is that property?
[1780.28] If you've come here to talk about
these things then please leave.
[1784.02] I don't want to hear anything else.
[1786.45] Are you going to humiliate and throw
us out of the house for that cheater?
[1792.33] I've always heard that love is blind.
[1794.39] Today I saw it too.
[1797.43] I think Umar Bhai has
worked some magic on her;
[1801.28] she wouldn't be supporting him like
this after everything that has happened.
[1806.23] If I had a husband like that, 
I would've sent him straight to jail.
[1809.81] Let's go, Shehryar. I won't tolerate 
any more humiliation.
[1813.94] Don't come to house again.
[1816.80] Just think that Mehr-un-Nisa is dead.
[1840.39] When my own daughter doesn't trust me,
how can I be upset at strangers?
[1848.18] Forget about Rameen.
[1850.56] I'll set her straight.
[1853.45] She won't ever dare to
disrespect you again. Let her come.
[1863.86] You've finally gotten better,
thank God, and you're getting so angry!
[1868.76] I'm angry at Shehryar.
[1874.60] Still. You shouldn't have insulted them.
[1878.39] He's your cousin. He's older than you.
[1881.06] What does it matter 
even if he said something?
[1884.66] He's cousin, he's my family. 
Is that how family is?
[1888.32] You know this really well.
[1890.85] After Abbu death, they never even bothered 
to check on us.
[1893.96] It was us who used to go and meet them.
[1899.72] If we're in this crisis today...
[1903.29] we weren't begging them. They could've said
two kind words to us. That's it.
[1909.22] They just taunted us and left.
[1915.36] How many people are you going
to leave?
[1917.80] They're your relatives.
[1920.60] People are to talk when they meet us.
[1924.10] Such relatives can go to hell
who can't respect my husband.
[1929.64] They're not welcome in my house.
[1931.97] They didn't come here 
because they care.
[1933.98] They came to see the spectacle.
They feel happy seeing us like this.
[1937.36] I won't let them enter my home.
[1940.56] Abbu...
[1942.46] was right to object to my 
and Shehryar's wedding.
[1946.24] Now I understand why.
[1949.96] I think he made the wrong decision.
[1954.14] If he agreed to that wedding, today, you
would've been the wife of The Shehryar...
[1959.51] the big businessman.
[1961.80] Millionaire.
[1964.11] And me?
[1967.58] You married a middle class man.
[1972.61] Umar, don't say that please.
[1974.83] I'm right though.
[1977.38] I mean, look. It took my whole life
to make my wife and daughter happy.
[1988.00] To give them everything, but...
[1990.76] What can I do though? Couldn't do anything.
[1996.16] I love you and you make me very happy.
[2000.90] Really, I'm very happy.
[2002.96] Just because you're going through a crisis,
[2004.59] doesn't mean you start
considering your life partner unlucky
[2009.22] We'll gather courage and handle 
everything, face it all.
[2023.46] Rameen.
[2024.58] - Yes, Auntie?
- Look at this. I was going to the office.
[2027.95] I thought I'd give you this set
to wear at the reception.
[2031.66] Oh!
[2033.58] This is a diamond set,
Shahnawaz got it made for me specially.
[2037.81] Auntie, I already have so much jewelry.
I'll wear something from it.
[2040.77] This is very expensive.
[2041.86] No, no. Everything I have is yours 
and Minal's.
[2045.07] And, yes! The city situation is bad.
[2046.85] After the reception, give me all
of your jewelery to keep in the safe.
[2049.65] No, definitely. I'll gather everything
and give it to you.
[2051.89] First thing in the morning. Thank you.
Thank you so much.
[2093.82] Umar.
[2097.32] Why did you bring the water?
[2099.01] I would've gotten it myself.
You're not feeling well anyway.
[2104.51] Yes, I just remembered.
[2107.31] The property dealer 
has shown me some properties.
[2110.98] You should take a look at it in the evening
too. We'll confirm the one you like.
[2114.79] I don't need to take a look at it.
Select whichever one you want.
[2119.20] I think we should shift after Rameen
and Shahzar's reception though.
[2124.15] Speaking of reception, 
what are we giving them?
[2129.45] We've already given them so much, 
touch wood.
[2131.90] What's the need to give more gifts?
And beside,
[2135.16] it's not their anniversary or a birthday.
It's the walima reception.
[2138.21] - We'll still have to give something.
- Do you think so?
[2142.17] So...
[2144.18] I have some savings. I'll do something.
[2152.21] No one will be worse than me if you
go to tomorrow's function empty-handed.
[2157.64] That's fine but what is this?
[2161.74] These are my savings.
[2163.92] Now you and your daughter
have the right to these.
[2167.78] No, Ammi Ji...
[2169.45] You keep it with you. Wear it yourself.
I'll manage something.
[2173.76] There's no need.
[2174.97] If it's not needed now
then when will it be needed?
[2178.27] Select something for yourself.
[2181.81] And take something for Rameen.
[2184.48] Yeah! In fact, I have two gold bracelets.
It's an old design.
[2189.45] Let's go to the jeweler and get it remade
into the latest design.
[2194.57] Rameen will be happy and she'll
gain respect at her in-laws' too.
[2199.51] Thank you so much, Ammi Ji.
[2202.90] Whatever I have, it's for you.
[2207.19] What are you thinking, dear?
It's good, right?
[2210.45] Everything's fine.
