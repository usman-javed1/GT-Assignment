By the way, when are you all coming? Shahnawaz has agreed to the marriage
on the condition that you bring your daughter's proposal
to us. Shahzar, why don’t you understand?
All this is happening because of your father. Your mom called my dad to say that he came to
your house with my proposal. Sorry, I didn't want to scare you. No problem. What is it? I'm really sorry, Dad. Sorry for what, sweetheart? Things shouldn't have happened this way. Are you happy? That's it. All parents want
is that their children are happy. My child. My brave child. You know what? The dress I wore today wasn't made by
a designer.  My mother designed it herself. Your mom and your sister really liked it. How did you like it? I don't know. I didn't even see it. I couldn't take my eyes off you. You know what? I was really surprised today. You looked very beautiful. You don't have an idea... how lucky I feel after seeing you today. You're absolutely right though. I've never been this happy before. Because I was never as happy
as I was today. And you know why I was so happy? Because you're about to become mine. What more do I want. Today, I promise I will always take care
of you, keep you happy. You will never regret marrying me. I know. Umar. They're being really hasty
about the wedding. The want a date within a date.  You tell me,
how will everything be ready in a month? We'll prepare somehow. You, however, don't have to go
to the market. We'll hire an event management company,
they'll do everything. You know how much event managers
charge these days? Their bills go up to lakhs.
We can't afford it. Besides, 65-75 lakhs are anyway
going to be needed for the wedding. How are we going to do it? You don't worry. I've got savings set aside for the wedding. And if it's not enough,
I'll sell the apartment in Lahore. I won't let there be any shortage for
our daughter's wedding, God willing. God willing. The wedding should be grand,
people should remember it for years. We need an amazing venue for
the mehndi and walima ceremonies. Yes, why not, God willing. Do you think we'll be able to get a booking at
a nice place with our limited time? If you take my advice, I think you should
arrange both functions at the farm house. It's huge.  It's much bigger
than a five-star hotel I think. You're right, the plan is nice. I was thinking we could do something
different.  Something people will remember. Yes, that's fine.  Do whatever you want to. You remember the wedding we went
to Singapore for? What a beautiful wedding!
The resort was stunning. Yeah, what an event.  The pictures
and videos went viral on social media. We could also plan
a destination wedding! It's a great idea, Mom. I'll invite all of my friends.  We'll have a
lot of fun!  I'll create an invitation list. Oh, you've started.
Shahzar, what do you think? I think it’s a fantastic idea!
But do whatever makes you happy. It doesn't make a difference to me. Okay, then you take care
of your bachelor party. All of my preparations are done. I'll confirm with Tabinda if they're
inviting 400 or 500 guests for the baraat. All my relatives live abroad
so there's no need to invite them. In inquired about the booking.
All the five stars are already booked. I'll see if I can get it at a four star. - Farm house?
- Better idea.  Forget about the four stars. Farm house with a pool. I want the arrangements to be perfect,
it should be flawless. So that there is no trouble later. They’ll definitely arrange the
walima for their son at a five-star hotel. We can't compete with them.
They have generational wealth. Mom, Dad! Look!  The pictures of our engagement
are featured in the fashion magazine! - Wow!
- Yes! - Look at this.
- Touch wood! - My daughter looks beautiful.
- Whose daughter am I, after all? It's on the front page too.  Look. - Oh, wow.
- But who gave it to the magazine? Shahzar said his mother has a
lot of contacts in media and news. so the pictures get published
even if it's a birthday party. What's a birthday? They probably send their pictures to
magazines even when they sneeze! When you have so much money,
you don't know what to do with it. I feel like with this show-off behavior,
people forget about the evil eye. Mama, look how far the world has come,
and you’re sitting here talking about this! - Look, this one is so nice!
- Fireworks!  Firecrackers! Tell me if there is anything left. Oh, you'll be doing Umar a favor. His daughter has won the lottery. That she's getting married
into such a big house. She is getting married to Shahzar. But she'll never get the status
of a daughter-in-law in this house. I spoke to the event management company. They'll take care of all the arrangements. You don't burden yourself too much
and go running around. Out of the question. I've already told you, I'm capable of
preparing for my daughter's wedding myself. Ammi Ji, do you see her? I've told her too.  The doctor has advised
rest, but she just doesn't understand. Good morning, everyone. - Good morning, dear.
- Good morning, sweetheart. Baba, who are you telling to rest?
Mom is used to working. Even if there's nothing to do,
she'll find something to keep herself busy. Yes, she needs a lot of rest. Umar, you've increased your expenses
so much in the name of the wedding. What's the need for such a grand wedding? Oh, we'll know what's grand on the walima. So Shahzar was saying it'll either
be held in Singapore or Thailand. Auntie has been busy with the bookings, so everything will be finalized
in the next 3-4 days. And they're getting it booked for over
500 guests.  They'll bear all the expenses. Isn't it a bit too much, dear? Mama, we know how well-off they are. And not just within Pakistan, they
have a lot of property abroad too. In Dubai, London.
Anyway, forget about all of this. Shahzar was asking for the guest list. So they can get the bookings
for our guests there as well. No, there's no need for that.  It'll be
just a few family members.  Nothing more. I don't like putting burden on others. Although do let them know that... You tell them... they can bring as many guests
as they want on the baraat. This is the new fashion,
having weddings abroad. I didn't know that Shahzar's
family had so much wealth. It means, Umar, that we should also... arrange the baraat at a five-star. There's no need to follow
in their footsteps! I wouldn't have allowed him to do
all of this even if he had the means to. I don't like showing off at all. Dado, how is it showing off? The competition has
gotten so tough these days that all of this has become a necessity. It's not like that.
Dado is absolutely right. But, Ammi Ji, she's our only daughter.
We want to do a grand... But, dear, one should not exceed
their limits. They're generationally wealthy people. We are people who live a life of simplicity
and honesty. Your father doesn't have
a treasure chest of gold. He's already in a lot of debt. Yes, how are you? Bring Mehr-un-Nisa over
to our house someday, very soon we're about to
become in-laws. Yes, we will come for sure, God willing. I'm only bothering you now to
discuss the wedding arrangements. Yes, sure.  I wanted to talk to you too. Actually, we're planning to have
Shahzar's walima in Thailand. So our list is final for that,
we just need your guest list now. So tell me when are we meeting? Our guest list will be finalized, and as soon as it's finalized, I'll confirm
the booking at the Thailand resort. All right, what are the estimated costs? It's well within the budget.
It's close to a million dollars. Fair enough. So we have received the guest list
from Mr.  Umar? We'll get it by tomorrow. If you both take my advice, before holding the walima in Thailand,
you should meet Mr.  Umar and his wife. Why?  Why do we have to talk to them? We're the groom's family.  It's our event
and we'll decide where we'll hold it. In this way, they might be
overwhelmed with a sense of inferiority. We shouldn't burden them too much. We're not burdening anyone. We will do things according to our status, they should do it
according to theirs. Oh, no, no.  How can that be?
Call as many guests as you want. We have no problems.
I just have a small request. Please, no dowry.
I don't want any unnecessary formalities. How is it possible that we-- You can give your daughter
whatever you wish. After all, what's a better gift
than property? Her Mehr is also very handsome, Touch wood. And I plan to give her shares
in the business too. And it's not the time for bed sets
and sofa sets anyway, you know. There's no need for that. Your financial difficulties
and financial concerns, I know about them. But I just have a little request that... do something that... we still maintain some respect
among those we associate with. Yes, I... I... I'll try my best. After such a handsome Haq-Mehr... you're transferring property
in her name too? It's just on paper. It's just to make Umar and Shahzar happy.
My lawyer will handle everything else. Shahnawaz has never given you anything. And you're giving all this
to the future daughter-in-law? But if Shahzar found out about your lies,
he'll turn away from you. No, he won't find out.  Everything is fine
for now.  We'll deal with everything later. And what's the deal with having
the walima abroad? I haven't gotten any bookings done.
The walima won't be happening abroad. You don't worry.
You'll find out soon enough. What are you saying, dear?
What do you mean by all of this? Oh, you'll figure it out soon enough.
Just have a little patience. Listen, your cousin's daughter, Maria,
who's here from Hyderabad, invite her too. It'll be fun. Yeah, she's in Karachi these days.
I'll call her. You can give whatever you want
to your daughter, After all, what's a
better gift than property? Her Haq-Mehr is also very handsome,
touch wood. And I plan to give her shares
in the business too. And it's not the time for
bed sets and sofa sets anyway, you know. Whatever's happening, it's not right. I'm so helpless. I wish I was able to stop
this wedding somehow, I wish! Tabinda can go to any lengths
to take revenge from me. There's my daughter's happiness
on one side, and... sick wife on the other. What do I do? The wedding is right around the corner,
I can't even say no. Touch wood!  You look like
a beautiful princess. The dupatta is so heavy. It's so beautiful. Well, my daughter is so lovely
that anything would look good on her. I had a feeling from the beginning that she's doing this to
belittle you and take revenge. A snake snake like Tabinda will go
to any lengths when it comes to revenge. I warned you so many times to send
your daughter's proposal there, but... What do I do, Amma?
I had no control over this. On the one hand,
there’s my daughter’s obsession, and on the other, my wife’s illness.
How can I say no? If I had my way, I would have never allowed my daughter to go into that
house or let this wedding happen. Would you agree to their
unreasonable demands? Could you arrange so much money? I'll have to agree. It’s a matter of my daughter’s honor,
her in-laws. They don't even know yet
what my financial issues are. Well, the car is sorted, and Mehru has already arranged the jewelry. But calling 800 people for the wedding
and getting headgear worth 2000 rupees— that's just too much, it's wasteful.
Refuse it. I can't tell them no. They are doing so much themselves. They've written so much
for our daughter in her Mehr. After everything they've done,
I can't say no to them. It's up to you. You're badly stuck in debt. Have you thought about this?  That
apartment in Lahore isn't even selling. - Will you sell this house?
- I won't sell this house. I'm thinking... - of putting it in Rameen's name.
- What? Did Tabinda say this to you too? No, no.  She didn't say that.  I... I was thinking about it myself. She belongs to my daughter, after all. Today or tomorrow, I'll have to give it to
her.  What's a better occasion than this? How'd you like the pictures?  You saw them? Very beautiful. I was thinking... the girl who looks so
beautiful in her Mayon dress, how stunning will she
look in her wedding dress? Today, I feel in awe of my fate. I should be in awe of myself. After all, I'm getting tied
to a good person like you. You are very beautiful. And I'm very lucky to have you in my life. You know, before you, so
many girls came into my life, but I never felt any connection with
any of them. I never felt like any of them
could be my life partner. But when I saw you,
I knew right away that... you're the one... who could spend her entire life with me. And do you know when I realized
how important you are to me? - When?
- The day you attempted suicide. For a moment, I thought... I'm going to lose you. Forever. But then my prayers were answered,
and... you're with me today. Now don't be so over.
It doesn't matter anymore.  I'm here. So, have you found out where the
wedding expenses are being arranged from? Yes, I've found out. A company is giving them
50 lakhs for advertising. Right. In addition, they’ve sent a
quotation to Rizwan and his company. If approved, it will be
nearly 50 lakh worth of work. I also learned from my source that they have
already taken a 50 lakh loan from the bank. Today, their office sent a letter to
the bank requesting a 50 lakh loan. Okay, I need the bank
name, the vice president's and president's names,
and their contact number right now. Okay, I'll send you the details. The wedding preparations are in
full swing, but there’s such a long list. I've been so busy,
that's why I couldn't contact you. I know, my day has been equally busy. I've been running
around the markets all day. My complexion has gone so bad,
I think I'm tan now. What do you mean?  Don't tell me
you've become dark? What do you mean I've turned dark? I'll go for a facial
tomorrow at a good salon. No, no, no.  Not tomorrow. If you've become dark, you should go today.
I'm not marrying a dark girl. Oh, hello!  I'm not marrying a boring,
grumpy man either. I like to have some fun in my life. Really?  That's how it is? Fine, there's still one week to go. Think carefully and decide whether you really want to marry a boring, grumpy
man like me or not. Shahzar, our wedding is just a week away. We have no other option. We'll have to spend the rest of our lives
just tolerating each other. What are you thinking? I'm thinking, do I really want to spend the
rest of my life with a crazy girl like you? - Shahzar, you're crossing the limits now.
- Correction: talk with more respect. That's how you'll speak to me from now on. I'm your husband-to-be, respect me. Should I respect you?
Have you ever seen your face? Yes, I just remembered.
What happened with that quotation? Sir, we've received a great response. And, sir, they trust our
services completely. - Good.
- But there’s one issue, sir. Sir, their approval will take a week. If it takes a week for approval,
then the advance payment will take months. And I really need the money.
My daughter's wedding is coming, there are a hundred other problems,
how is all that going to happen? I've done another thing.  Look at this, sir. These are some projects. There are some companies in Lahore that
I've sent the quotations to. If their approval comes through,
it will be great for us. But, sir, if we get the citrus fruit ad,
that would be even better. But all these things will take time.
I need money urgently. I need some 40-50 lakh rupees. I've already applied for a loan
at the bank. Sir, you've already taken
loan worth 7 lakh from the bank. Sir, I have a suggestion. If you mortgage the Lahore apartment, it
will be easier for you to get the loan. I don't think you have
any other option, sir. Actually, I need to talk
to you about something. I think you’re considering
Umar Hassan’s quotation for the project. Yes, the one who wound up his business
and came here. I need a small favor from you. Actually, I have a very close friend
whose company has just started. I was wondering if you could
give this contract to their company. They're very good.  You'll have a
great experience working with them. I can promise you.
This will be my guarantee. Yes, I'll make the connection for you,
they'll call you. Just please give them a chance.
You'll be happy working with them. Yes, this contract--
At least consider them. Thank you very much.
I would be very grateful to you. Anything, anytime,
if you need anything from me. Thank you very much. Yes, okay.  Thanks a lot.  Goodbye! Don't put too much pressure on Umar, and don't create so many problems that he
refuses the wedding just two days before. He'll never refuse.
It's not even a question. He knows the impact it will have on
his wife and daughter if he refuses. Anyway, the news of Shahzar and Rameen's
engagement has spread all over the city. If he refuses now... all the disgrace and humiliation
will fall on him. Don't worry. The day is not far when Umar Hassan
will fall at my feet and ask for my help. Maybe that's when my heart will
feel peace, seeing his helplessness. Maybe then the wounds his betrayal
caused in my heart will begin to heal. I want to see him suffer in the
same way I have for ages. That day is not far. That day is not far. - What's going on?
- Careful, there are steps here. - Don't open your eyes.  That's it.
- Oh, Mama! - Don't you know your own house?  Careful.
- Okay. Listen, you can't cheat! - But what is it?
- You tried so hard to open your eyes. - Don't open your eyes!
- No, not yet!  Not at all. Don't open your eyes just yet, okay? Open your eyes. - This better be good.
- Yeah. - No!
- Yes! - It's mine?
- Yeah, this is for you. But this is my favorite car! So, idiot, we're your parents.
We know what you like. Tell her! - Isn't this very expensive?
- That's nothing to worry about. Thank you.  You're the best father
in the world! Oh, my God, thank you! - I didn't even tell you.
- Yeah, so? Wow! - Come on, you guys!
- You sit in there! - What's all this happening, Umar?
- What's happening? We've already spent
more than we could afford. And then you went and bought
a 30 lakh car for the dowry. Why? You were saying you would give
everything for our daughter's wedding, that it would be grand.
What happened to that plan? I agree, I wanted a grand wedding for her,
but... look at our financial situation. We've taken so much loan from the bank,
we have to pay it back with interest. How will we do that? If you listen to me,
I think you should sell the flat right now. There's hope of something happening,
so I don't think that'll be necessary. How? I'm negotiating with two or
three businesses, if we get a deal, things will work out.
In fact, all the expenses will be covered. God willing! I'm sure you'll get all these projects. Okay... There's one more thing
I was thinking about. What about? I was thinking, why not transfer the house
to Rameen's name? No, Umar.  Not right now. Why?  Just a few days ago, you said
we should transfer the house to Rameen. I still want that. But now is not the right time. What could be a better time than this?
I think this is the perfect time. Umar, I might not have much to live for
but you have your whole life ahead of you. Have some fear of God, man.
Why do you say such things? I want you to handle home and the business
after I'm gone. Rameen is still a child and she's getting
married into a nice family, touch wood. Her husband will give her everything. I mean, she'll get all the luxuries,
so why should we do it? Have I ever asked you for anything
for myself? So think as if I'm asking you today. My happiness is related to that. I'm sure you won't refuse. Have I ever refused you? As you wish. Finally!  Haven't you gotten a little fat? I love all the customs related to weddings.
We’ll do all of them, right?" - All of them?
- Yes, all of them. All right, whatever you say. Tell me, what will you give during
the muh dikhai? (a first look custom) Is that also a custom? As if you don't know! It’s the
most important custom. Tell me! - So I'll have to do it too? - No
, someone else will come and do it. All right? All right. I think in order to fulfill your wishes
and complete all these rituals, I might have to pull off a big heist. What? Why are you pulling my ears, girl? Leave
me! Everyone will see and wonder she's
already pulling her future husband's ears! Yeah, so? Why are you standing all alone like this? I hope all the preparations for the baraat are made
as per our discussion? Yes.
