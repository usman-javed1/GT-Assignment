Auntie, are you okay? - Mom?
- Oh, God! Mom? Mom, what happened? - Nothing, nothing.
- Auntie, are you okay? Can we go now?  We can come back later. I've been hearing these excuses
for the last two weeks.  Okay, here I go. Shahzar, if I got a new proposal, and parents said yes,
then please don't blame me. I've never seen you this troubled. You know, Rameen was asking
what happened to Baba. I just don't understand. You've never been like this. If you could share... Any problem-- Please! What do I tell you? There's no need to ask me any questions. In fact, for both you and your daughter,
it’s better not to ask me anything. And let me tell you something else too. I will not arrange a marriage for her
in this house under any circumstances. Shahnawaz... my problems and yours are separate. They may never be resolved, but you know very well that... I want Shahzar to be a successful man. He is about to make a very big decision
in his life, and... I fear he might make a mistake. What are you trying to say?  Bottom line. He is completely
trapped in that girl's web. I don't trust those people. Why are you being covert?
Speak plainly. Shahnawaz, it’s not so easy to talk to you. I wanted to consult you, but... - you...
- Look, Tabinda. I'm sorry.  But you haven't been
a good wife. but I have issues in saying
that you're a good mother. If you don't like this proposal... - just say no.
- I can't do that. Because I'm the stepmother. Stepmothers are always stepmothers. Her decisions are separate too. If I make a decision, the world will say I didn’t care
about Shahzar’s happiness. So what are your objections? I've inquired about that family. Rameen's father comes
from a lower-class family and... married his wife out of greed. Later, he cleverly, or by cheating, or
however, he took everything in his name. This is what I found out. and now Rameen's marriage to Shahzar...
I don't know what they are thinking. - I just wanted to inform you.
- Wh-- what are you saying? I'm right. I've thoroughly inquired everything. This is what I found out. This is why I'm worried
and wanted to consult you. You've said something very strange. Omar Hassan's daughter and your son! This is a big shock for me too. That man who broke off all our relations,
our engagement, left me for a wealthy woman... his daughter will get married
and come to my house? Impossible! You can do whatever you want, but the decision must come from Shahnawaz. After all, he is the real father.
And you're just the stepmother. No, this won't happen. The rejection will come from
Shahnawaz himself.  Don't worry. - Why would he reject though?
- We'll need to think of something. If he finds out that you're
behind all of this, then? You will need to be very
careful with your steps. I'll see what I have to do. Let's see. I thought of inviting you
to the house first. But then I thought... it's better to talk over the phone. Go ahead, give your command, Sir. The information you gave
about Umar Hassan and his family... I heard it all through Tabinda. But I still want to hear it from you. What should I say?
They're nothing but two-timing people, he 's the worst kind of man, and... I don't want to say it , but... it's not a good idea to form
any relationship with such a family. It's been a while since we
returned from Rameen's house. Why haven't you all made a decision yet? I can't make this decision,
it's for your father to decide. But honestly, I really liked her.
I really liked Rameen. I feel like you both
are made for each other. So why don't you move forward with it? Again?  How can I move things forward?
This is a decision for your dad to make. He is your real father. I'm not your real mother.  It's his right. Why are you saying that? You are just like a real mother to me. Besides, you've always made decisions
in this house. - You'll decide about my marriage too.
- Look, this... this is your life, your marriage. And this decision belongs to your father. I've told you. We won't argue about this.
It's my marriage, and I want you to decide. But how can he decide when he’s
never shown any interest in family matters? I'm sure he doesn't care about this at all. All right, fine.  Let's go
to Rameen's place tomorrow. - Really?  Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure. Thank you. I'll go and tell Rameen. Mom!  Oh, God!  I'm so happy! - What happened?  Tell me.
- The news is so good! - Tell me, what happened?
- You'll go crazy hearing this! One second. Such a drama queen!  Tell me quickly. Shahzar called. He said his mom liked us and they’re
coming tomorrow to finalize everything. I'm so happy. Oh, hello! - Hello!  I'm good.
- How are you?  How was office? Okay, we'll talk about everything later. Shahzar called.  And he told me his mom... Dear, please don't mention this guy
's name in front of me again. You didn't tell her about my decision? Which decision? Do you have any objections? Dear, forget about this guy. We've already fixed your engagement
with Arshad, Mr.  Mazoor's son. They're coming in two days
for the formal engagement. You can't do this to me!
You're joking, right? You think I'd joke with you? You know that I love Shahzar.
Despite knowing that, you're doing this? - Don’t you care about my happiness at all?
- I'm only doing this for your happiness. Understand? But my happiness is only
with Shahzar, Baba. I can't think of anyone else. Please.  Please don't do this. We've given them our word, dear. We come from a well-reputed family. We don't go back on our word. Talk to her. The menu for today is lavish,
especially your favorite biryani. Your mom made everything.  Look. - Really?
- What? Mom in the kitchen for the whole day?
I still can't believe this. - Be quiet and eat your food.
- Mom, she's right actually. Even I can't believe it. That such a busy
business woman like yourself, can also take time out to cook as well as
a housewife! This is all because of Rameen bhabi.  After
all, your proposal has been finalized. Thank you. Rameen? Who is this Rameen that she's referring to
as her sister-in-law? I had already told you
that Shahzar likes Rameen and that we need to take a proposal to
their house. But I think I've rejected that proposal. Yes, but there’s no harm
in meeting once, right? Enough! I've had enough of this.  You've been
making decisions in this house as you wish. Shahzar is my son, my child! A man like Umar Hassan... a greedy man like him... it's impossible for him to
become his son-in-law. It's too much now! But, Dad... Why are you saying this?
What are your objections? I have no objections to you marrying
that girl. But for a man like Umar Hassan
to become my in-law?  That's impossible. I've lived my life as I could, but I would never want you to live the kind of
life I've lived. Mama, how can Baba do this to me? He was this stone-hearted before. He never denied me anything my entire life. He listened to everything I said. But now, when it comes to my marriage,
he has taken a one-sided decision. He knows how much I love Shahzar, Mama. but you just stood there listening,
and didn't say anything. You please go and talk to him. He listens to everything you say. Please talk to him.
He'll agree if you talk to him. What do you think, love?  That I didn't
try to explain it to him?  Talk to him? He won't listen.  What can I do? I knew you would say this. You've spent your whole life
bowing your head before Dad. You've never stood up for me. Please, listen to me.  Please. Give me some time.  I'll talk to him again.
I promise you. You won't do anything now
because you can't. Whatever there is to do now, I'll do it. I'll go without eating for two days,
he'll soften up and listen to me! So you're going
to emotionally blackmail father? I'll do everything
if he won't listen to me! You will do no such thing!  Do you hear me? I just want to know
why he rejected the proposal. I don't know!  I asked him a lot! He's not telling me. If Dad thinks... I'll marry anyone other than Shahzar,
tell him he's mistaken. That will never happen. By rejecting that proposal, you’ve
proven to me that no matter what you say... I do hold some importance in your life. Thank you. Everything I did... I did for my son's happiness... and for his better future. You shouldn't be under the illusion... that I rejected that proposal just for you. Nor should you be under the illusion
that I have feelings for you. Shahzar... is my son, my child. I will make the decisions for his life. I would never want him
to live the kind of life I've lived. I won't let someone like
you—greedy, manipulative, self-centered, and low class—cast a
shadow over his life. Got it. Get lost! I'm telling you, don't worry.
I'll convince him. I know exactly what he's doing. He just wants to hurt me and you. First he hated you... now he hates me too. Be patient.  Things will be okay. How much more patience can I have? How much more patience can I have?
I've lost my patience! I've seen him humiliate you
my whole life... disrespect you. He didn't value a woman, a wife like you. He's a sadist. He cannot be happy himself,
nor can he see others be happy. Okay, enough.  He's your father. He is my father
but I have always listened to him, followed what he said. And now when the time comes for
him to listen to me, he doesn't trust me. And honestly speaking,
I don't trust him anymore. You trust me? What kind of a question is that?
Of course I trust you. You are the only one who understands
my heart, and not just understands me, but also fulfills my every wish. Let me handle this matter then. No. I can't let you be humiliated
because of me. This is my matter, and the time has come
for me to speak to him directly. I will do it today.  Right now, in fact. Listen. Do you really think... he will just sit quietly and listen to you? It's impossible. I know Shahzar better than you do. He's stubborn and very principled. Once he makes a decision, he sticks to it. That clever woman has poisoned his mind. My son is not so rude or ill-mannered. He’s a grown man now, and that doesn’t
mean he can talk back to his father. What is your problem? Tell me clearly. I found out some strange things
about that girl's father. He comes from a lower-class background. And then, in his quest to become rich
, he married his boss's daughter, took all the property, and spent his life in luxury at the
expense of that orphan girl's wealth. But what’s Rameen’s fault in this? Why should the daughter suffer
for her father's sins? Who am I to punish people? Whether the girl is good or bad,
I don't care. What I care about is my son, Shahzar,
and my family’s name. He can never find a naive
and foolish son-in-law like Shahzar. You have no right... You have no right to accuse a respectable man like Umar Uncle
based on their own temper and behavior. You have no right to use
such words about him. Do you see the tone
he's using to talk to me? - You've taught me this.
- Shut up. Phuppo, you make him understand this. If he has a valid reason for rejecting
this proposal, he should explain it to me. If not, then... I’ll be forced to go to Umar Uncle and
ask for Rameen’s hand in marriage myself. I know! I know who's filling your mind
with these things. That woman has poisoned your mind so much
that now you're standing against me that-- No one has filled my heart with hatred. She has taught me how to love, Dad! You sowed the seeds of hatred in my heart. You always made me resent that woman. Against a woman who took care
of your own child even more than her own! A woman who served you her entire life.
And what did you do in return? You always hated her, never gave her respect.
You never gave her a place in this house. Don't you realize that this house
was just an empty house before? It was that woman who turned
your empty house into a home, a paradise. And in return, you always hated her,
mocked her. And what did she do in return?  Nothing. Nothing but surrender to you. She is a much bigger person than you! She has taught me so much, given me such a good upbringing, and made me
capable of standing on my own two feet. But you never did any of that. I'm really sorry to say this,
I didn't want to, but I have to. You are an extremely self-centered, ungrateful, and selfish person. And do you know
what your biggest problem is? You think every person
in the world is a liar. You're a sadist. You can't be happy yourself,
and you can't see anyone else happy, even if it's your own child. Shahzar, son, calm down and speak sensibly. How can I stay calm? I can't stay sane in this madhouse,
maybe you can. That's why I've made a decision. If his behavior doesn't change, I
won't tolerate it anymore. As soon as the morning comes,
I'm leaving this house, forever. So you'll rest after licking stones
like a fish? If you think so, then yes,
that's exactly what I'll do. So what are you waiting for? Why are you waiting for the morning? Leave this house right now. And if you don't leave yourself, I'll call
the servants and have them throw you out. I won't need that. I'm your son, Dad. I'm leaving on my own. And I won't ever come back. - Shahzar!
- Let him go. - Shahzar!
- Let him go. - Shahnawaz, he's leaving, stop him!
- Let him go! - Stop him, he's leaving!
- Let him go! He'll be outside for a few days.  Once
he faces some difficulties, he will learn. All his fantasies of love will fade away. They've been flaunting
their father's wealth. When he goes to ask for her hand
empty-handed and broke, then he'll learn! What-- what have you done? - You've thrown your son out of the house.
- I didn't throw him out; He left on his own. He wants to waste my hard-earned wealth
on that girl. How could he even think of bringing
the daughter of that rogue into this house? Everyone knows about his bad reputation. You're right, but this wasn't the solution. Now he has the chance.  He'll go for a
court marriage tomorrow.  What will you do? What lesson will you teach him?  Nothing! I only told you to reject the proposal,
and I'll handle everything else. Your anger and rashness
are always causing big problems! But you don't understand! Listen. How is she? Did she eat? What do you expect after punishing
someone so severely without reason? Don't you know about Rameen? How do you think she'll be? I'm doing this for her good.
Why don't you understand this? Umar, how can I understand you when you never gave me
any reasons for your rejection? Share it with me or don't you trust me? Oh, I trust you more than myself. But why are you not understanding me?
I can't explain it because of your illness! But I have some reservations
about their family background. They are beyond our means. His mother is very arrogant,
very proud about it. How can such a woman be a
good mother-in-law for my daughter? What don't we have? We will give our daughter
everything, God willing. Fine, we gave her everything, and yet
she’s not happy in her own home.  Then? That's it!  I've said it. Mr.  Manzoor is coming in two days
with his son.  I won't delay this marriage. I'm sorry, Umar. I can't support you on this. Because I don't agree with this. Fine, you rejected Shahzar's proposal. But you're going to force your only
daughter to marry against her will? Rash decisions always lead to mistakes. Me-- Mehr! I'm really shocked
by what your dad has done. He threw his only son out of the house
for such a small thing. Mr.  Umar anyway belongs
to a respectable family. I've heard great things about him. Then what are your dad's objections? He's just being stubborn. And you know he always goes against things that
Mom and I like. I don't understand.
Man, I can't believe it! Is there any father in this world who would
place his own ego above his child's wishes? It's unbelievable. Don't lose hope. In a few days, he'll soften.
He will accept your happiness. Maybe it's because
we haven't met in a long time, which is why you don't know about my dad. He's a very stubborn man
and he won't let this go. But I'm also his son. I'll see how long he can stay stubborn for. I've made my decision.
I won't go back home. I'll marry only Rameen,
or I won't marry at all. What do you think?  I... was thinking of going to Umar Uncle
and talking about Rameen myself. I'm just waiting for a proper living
arrangement, a job first, and then I'll go. You don't need to worry.
You can stay here as long as you want, and as far as the job goes,
everything will fall into place. Drink your coffee. Thank you, my friend. Here. Eat through my hands. Eat! What am I telling you? You haven't eaten
anything since morning, dear. - Eat.
- I don't want to eat! Give me poison. Your brother is already troubling me. Now you're also troubling me. Why does Dad always do this to us? Every time there's a moment of happiness,
he ruins it. We were all so excited
for Shahzar bhai's wedding. Phuppo, I’ve seen it in Rameen’s eyes;
She loves Shahzar bhai deeply. No one could love him more than she does. You should talk to Dad.  Explain to him. If you explain, he'll agree. Okay, all right. I'll talk to him. I'll convince him. You don't worry at all. But promise me you won't cry anymore. And eat something from my hands?
Come on. Come on, open your mouth quickly. Good. Good, very good. That's more like it. Where are you, Shahzar?  I've been
calling you for so long.  Check your phone. Do you have any idea how worried I am
because of you? I'm really sorry, Rameen. Actually, there’s been some tension
at home, so I couldn’t get in touch. Is everything all right? No, there's tension at my house too.
Do you know what happened? Your proposal got rejected by Dad
before it was even official. He wants me to marry
some friend's son instead. What? He did that? Okay, I... I'll call you. Why don’t you go to Umar
Hassan’s office yourself and talk to him about the proposal? It doesn't seem appropriate for me
to go there now. Why don't you go and talk to him? I could go, but you know your dad. Who knows what his reaction will be? He will divorce me
or throw me out of the house. You're right. Forget it.  Don't go.
Let's see what happens. On second thoughts. I'm ready to take this risk for you, tell
me when I should go? Why would you do this?  I know very well that if Dad finds
out I went there, he won't react, but if he finds out about you,
it'll cause a storm in the house. Shahnawaz... I understand the reasons for his rejection. Rameen's background, Umar Hassan's past. But Umar Hassan's refusal to this proposal
makes no sense to me. Even Rameen doesn't know that. I've asked her many times, but... I think he just didn't like us
from day one. That's how his reaction seemed to me. The day you got sick. I thought it was just infatuation,
and it would pass in a few days, but now it seems serious. All boys and girls are like this these
days.  They all go through these phases! No, he just became a mad lover. He doesn't have the shortage of girls
around him either. In fact, have you seen how
Shahzar is the first boy in our family for whom girls are sending proposals. I think the girl must be very beautiful. Oh, no!  Not at all.  She's nothing special.
The matter is of the heart, not looks. Oh, forget it. Try to manage Shahnawaz. His anger is quick,
but don't let him soften for his son. And remember, he shouldn't
find out about your past with Umar. He already hates you, but if he finds out about this, I do
n't know what will happen. You're right. I realize this. I'll be careful. If you're here to talk about Rameen's
proposal, I've already rejected it. I don't want to discuss it further either. The best thing for you is to let
your mother choose someone for you. - Just listen to me for two minutes.
- I have to go for an important meeting. If this is not about Rameen,
we can meet tomorrow evening. It is about Rameen. - Rameen and I love each other.
- Enough! In my office... for my daughter... I don't like this. Why are your objections?  Please tell me. I've already arranged a marriage
for my daughter with my friend's son. He's becoming a surgeon, a big surgeon. You know that you're not just being unfair
to me, but to your daughter too. Son, Rameen is my daughter.  A daughter! And as a father, I have the right
to make decisions for her. Thank you. Your son came to my office today. To talk about his relationship, and I told him clearly: it won't happen. Don't be happy with your rejection; We'll come to your home
and beg for the relationship. Tell Rameen to stop dreaming
about marrying Shahzar. Otherwise, her name will be ruined
in the whole society. What can you do apart
from these cheap tricks? What hope do I have from you? I can do a lot, but I don't want to. It’s better for her to step back
so that this matter can be resolved easily. Look, Madam Tabinda, there’s no
shortage of proposals for my daughter, and there’s nothing special
about your son either. I won't send my daughter to your house
as long as I live. Living with you in your home
is like living in hell. And let me tell you, within a week, I'll arrange my
daughter's marriage, and you'll see. In a better and a bigger family
than yours. Of course!  You should definitely invite us. Why didn't you tell me what happened
to my dad? It's better
if you ask your father yourself. Shahzar, what do I ask him?
He's in such a bad mood since yesterday! Didn't you even try to get him to agree? In fact, he didn't even listen to me. He kicked me out of his office, saying that he's arranged your marriage
to someone better than me. My father can't say something like that. My father's opinions about your father
are absolutely correct. He’s a materialistic man. - He married your mother for money and--
- One minute, Shahzar. Just because I love you doesn't
mean I'll let you speak ill of my father. I'm sorry, but the truth is the truth, and I've called to let you know
that I'm going back to my home. It means you're giving up? I left home because of you, but now that we can't get married, what do I do? Rameen, I think fate has decided
we can't be together. You... you'll leave me? What can I do? I can't make you run away with me
and marry you against your father's wishes. So I don't have any other options. We can try, please!
