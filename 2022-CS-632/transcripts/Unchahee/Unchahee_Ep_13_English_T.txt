[0.06] From flowers and from buds
[4.51] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.29] When I saw you
[14.05] I learned how to chirp from you
[18.72] Aima, were you crying?
[23.08] No, I wasn't.
[27.45] Did anybody say something to you?
Sister or Nosheen?
[31.95] Zaid, I am not Aima,
so behave yourself, okay?
[35.26] Then don't listen, go from here.
[37.65] I am a savage person,
I start beating up people walking by.
[41.84] It's not like that, Zaid.
[43.49] Yes, I knew about your character.
[45.51] But I can't support you here
because I was not aware of anything.
[51.09] You called him yourself.
You went to meet him at his flat as well.
[54.41] For all I know, you might be having
an affair with him too.
[66.40] Are you guys with patient Shabana Hassan?
[68.34] -Yes.
-How is my mother, doctor?
[70.89] Is everything all right?
[72.19] Yes, the patient is out of danger now.
[75.23] Thank God.
[77.60] What is wrong with mother, doctor?
[81.34] She had a major heart attack.
[88.07] we will have to do her angiography,
[89.77] so that we can find out
how many arteries are blocked?
[93.39] Major heart attack?
[95.61] How longer are you going to keep her here?
[98.00] We have to keep her under observation
for 2-4 days. It all depends on her condition.
[102.83] But how did it happen so suddenly?
[104.67] Your patient already had heart issues.
[107.16] And such patients are advised
not to take any sort of stress.
[113.44] We have done the tests
[114.92] and on its basis whatever diagnosis
we make, we will share it with you.
[118.11] She has taken a lot of stress about
something which has burdened her heart.
[124.21] Anyway, you will have to
take care of her.
[126.00] And she should avoid any sort
of physical activity.
[129.09] And take care of her diet too.
[133.29] And don't give her any news
which is too shocking for her.
[136.68] Yes we will be careful about that.
[138.77] When can we meet her?
[141.02] You can meet her.
[142.62] But please try not to talk much
with the patient.
[145.94] Meet her one by one.
[147.50] Okay, Aima you go.
[149.95] Dad, please sit down.
[157.69] -Thank God.
-Thank God.
[184.36] Thank God,
[187.21] you are all right now, Mother.
[192.90] We'll take you home very soon.
[198.41] You have no idea how scared I was.
[240.59] Tell me, Aima, is everything all right?
[245.53] Zaid, do one thing, take Aima home.
Freshen up and get back in the morning.
[251.07] I am here to take care of Shabana.
[254.17] -Dad, I...
-I have told you to go home.
[256.59] Shabana is better now,
I will take care of her.
[261.25] Zaid...
[292.80] Shabana... No, keep lying down.
[298.73] Brother...
[302.16] I am really ashamed.
[303.79] Don't talk too much, we will talk later.
Just relax now.
[307.99] You had to face so much because of us.
[311.43] I am worried,
[313.55] but not because of you
but because of your health.
[318.26] And I am really sorry too, Shabana,
[321.24] that I was not able to fulfill
the promise properly that I did to father.
[326.31] I wasn't able to take care of you properly.
[328.56] Don't say like that, brother.
[331.59] Only the fortunate ones
get brothers like you.
[335.41] I am one of those fortunate ones.
[338.85] You know, father said to me
in his last days
[343.86] that take care of your sister properly,
[346.72] or else I am going to hit you
with my stick on the day of judgment.
[350.12] I will save you that day the same way
I used to save you in childhood.
[358.61] Okay now don't talk too much,
the doctor has told you not to.
[363.87] I am going outside
or else you will keep talking.
[366.83] -Brother.
-Hmm?
[369.55] Brother, you seem really tired
to me, you should go home.
[374.41] Don't worry about me, I'm fine.
Just take rest.
[401.20] Mama, have you noticed?
[403.52] The mother has kept busy
dad in taking care of her there,
[406.03] and here my brother is busy
 in taking care of the daughter.
[409.81] I don't understand till when are both of
them going to exploit the men in our house.
[416.90] Until you are going to let them.
[419.23] Didn't you notice
how he went straight after Aima?
[425.39] It's not what you are thinking.
[429.73] -What is it then?
-He is doing it because of friendship only.
[433.83] Really?
[435.99] Actually Zaid likes a girl called Kinza.
[439.59] Really? My would-be
sister-in-law's name is Kinza?
[444.23] Don't be in a fool's paradise.
[447.00] Don't know if he actually likes her
or is it something casual.
[450.35] You know brother so well.
[453.22] And how casually you said
that it might be casual.
[457.27] Faisal is better than brother,
at least he is loyal with me.
[463.26] Oh come on, he must have had
a few other affairs.
[467.92] Boys these days are just like that.
[470.43] For your kind information,
it's nothing like that with Faisal.
[476.00] That loafer might not
have found anyone else.
[479.54] Zaid is so smart. He has so many options
when it comes to girls.
[483.82] Mama, don't humiliate Faisal like that.
He is your would-be son-in-law.
[488.02] Oh, please. As if
you are Faisal's relative.
[492.67] By they way, if brother has so many
options, why is he after this hideous Aima?
[499.81] I am telling you, if there is something
serious going on with Kinza,
[503.10]  Aima is going to get it stopped.
[506.13] I am worried about that too.
[537.07] Careful, take her carefully.
[540.23] Noorani, get all the stuff from the car.
[546.36] Aima, careful.
[579.73] Dad, I was thinking
we should talk about that...
[582.89] Nothing is more important for me
than Shabana's health right now.
[587.38] We can discuss other things later on.
[591.23] -Yes, Dad.
-She is not well.
[595.66] Stay with her all the time. Don't leave
her alone even for a single moment.
[600.45] Okay.
[602.77] I don't want her to wait for
anything even for a single moment.
[608.44] Thank God that she didn't need angioplasty.
[613.10] Yes, you are absolutely right.
[615.86] If you get tired
while taking care of her then tell Zaid.
[620.98] But don't leave her alone.
[622.78] Yes, Dad, don't you worry...
[639.98] I went to ask how your sister was doing.
[643.05] Yes, you should have gone.
[645.58] I know but your niece can't tolerate us.
[650.32] What do you mean?
[651.98] I went and sat with Shabana just for a few
minutes, and your niece asked me to leave.
[656.94] Why did I get unwanted
[661.59]  Nobody knows that
[666.34] Why did I get unwanted
[670.85]  Nobody knows that
[675.85] I didn't sleep at all last night.
[678.14] Whenever I closed my eyes
your face came in front of me.
[683.45] Sister, please forgive me,
[686.43] you all have been through
a lot of trouble because of me.
[690.86] Even after having a
hundred differences among us
[693.02] but still I wasn't able
to see you in pain.
[697.25] That's your greatness.
[699.20] You suddenly had a heart attack?
[703.78] You know it well, sister.
[706.56] Since Aima's father has passed away
[710.37] I am facing this problem.
[712.76] That's true.
[714.39] But I mean, did you hear such news
[718.40] because of which your heart
got so effected?
[725.10] Auntie, it's time for mother's medicine,
after which she is going to rest.
[731.01] So please can you come later.
[733.44] I just came to see how Shabana is doing.
[737.11] I think you didn't like my coming here.
[740.62] No, no, it's nothing like that, auntie.
[743.32] Let mother rest for a while
and then you can come back later.
[747.73] Okay, then, take rest, have your medicine.
I'll come back later.
[753.09] No, sister, please sit, it's all right.
[767.77] Aren't you even going to look at me now?
[773.19] Mother, you have full right
to be angry with me.
[776.94] But at least confirm it first,
[779.02] that the fault I am being punished for,
whether I have done it or not.
[787.08] I admit, I did a mistake.
[790.09] You should question me that Aima
have you committed a mistake or not?
[796.95] Aima...
[800.14] I wasn't even expecting a mistake from you.
[803.00] Why, Mother? Am I not a human?
[806.69] Can't I make mistakes?
[811.31] And you are one of those
 who forgive mistakes.
[814.69] Aren't you going to forgive
your daughter then?
[819.23] What you have done is not a mistake,
[825.00] at least to me it's not called a mistake.
[828.48] What have I done, mother?
[833.07] You know it very well.
[835.02] Mother, I didn't know
that your trust on me was so fragile
[841.61] that you would even believe
a whisper in the air against me.
[846.51] Either you don't trust
your upbringing, or my character.
[853.45] But you must believe me,
[855.81] I haven't degraded any of these things.
[860.15] -What was all this then, Aima?
-Mother, I just made a mistake.
[864.86] I have unknowingly made a mistake because
of which I am bearing the punishment.
[869.79] Unknowingly.
[873.57] How can all this happen unknowingly?
[876.20] Even if you don't have it, Mother,
[877.76] but I have completely trust
on your upbringing and my character.
[884.37] Whatever has happened,
someone has trapped me.
[888.36] There has been
a huge conspiracy against me.
[893.10] And as far as the mistake is concerned,
yes I have made a mistake
[897.15] that I didn't recognize this conspiracy.
[899.98] and kept getting stuck into the mire
[907.45] Fine.
[910.74] I have a feeling too
that this is a conspiracy.
[915.37] But the thing which I regret is
[920.13] that why didn't you share it with me?
[925.91] You know it well that I take you
more like a friend than a daughter.
[930.49] That's one of my mistakes too, Mother,
[933.62] that I became so cautious
in front of my enemies
[936.84] that I couldn't say anything
in front of my friends even.
[941.05] This allegation is raising fingers
towards you more than towards me.
[948.16] On your upbringing.
[950.01] And I can't tolerate that.
[953.61] I am sure, whoever has conspired against me
[958.42] God will unveil him one day.
[964.23] Mother...
[967.16] I know that I'm your pride.
[969.61] You have made a lot of
efforts while raising me.
[972.63] I will destroy myself but can never
destroy your pride for me.
[979.85] Just trust your daughter.
[997.00] I went to see how your sister was doing.
[1000.00] Yes, you should have.
[1002.53] -I know but your niece can't tolerate us.
-What do you mean?
[1009.00] I sat with Shabana for a few minutes
only and your niece asked me to leave.
[1014.56] Almas, for God's sake.
[1018.35] Can you be a little considerate?
[1020.45] You are not supposed
to complain all the time.
[1023.51] Well, there is never a right time to
listen to our complains for you.
[1027.30] Doctor has asked Shabana
not to talk too much.
[1030.23] May be that's why Aima said it to you.
[1033.50] I didn't go there to have a long discussion
with her. It was the usual small talk.
[1037.30] What happened, when did
it happen and why, that's it.
[1040.89] Now, please, let them rest and me as well.
[1045.62] We are quite tired after staying up
at the hospital.
[1051.02] Tell me, what was the bill at the hospital?
[1055.00] It's quite an expensive hospital.
[1058.98] Why? Why do you want to know?
[1061.97] You must have spent a lot,
I wanted to know just like that.
[1065.75] Must be in hundred thousands.
It's quite a huge hospital.
[1070.23] Do you want to pay the bill?
[1072.64] No I was just worried
because I'm your wife.
[1076.58] That's why I was asking.
[1078.28] Almas, just worry about the matters
that you are concerned with. Got it?
[1083.24] It's just useless to talk to you.
[1109.21] How could I think wrong about my daughter.
[1113.85] Why did I listen to others?
[1118.42] I should have trusted you my daughter.
[1138.09] You both must be thinking that
why have I called you here right now.
[1143.86] -Yes, Dad.
-Yes.
[1147.84] I'm a man of principles
since the beginning.
[1151.29] I never have compromised on my principles.
[1154.85] NO matter if someone likes it or not.
[1159.02] If I found anything against
my principles, I never approved of it.
[1165.62] But now, I have started to think.
[1168.59] Think what, Dad?
[1174.20] I have started to think
that the world has changed a lot.
[1177.86] Times have changed.
[1181.59] The ways to deal with things have changed,
but my principles are as they were.
[1192.00] Because I stand firm
over my principles,
[1193.82] that's why I make my
decisions that way too,
[1195.39] maybe that's why
my decision aren't liked by others.
[1198.65] Especially your generation.
[1203.07] It's not like that, Dad.
[1208.22] It is like that.
[1211.83] May be while bringing you guys up,
[1214.74] I have made unnecessary restrictions,
I've been tough on you.
[1218.70] Yes.
[1222.77] But my intention always was to raise you
well and make you a good human being.
[1234.15] I...
[1236.43] Dad, I am satisfied with you upbringing.
[1241.06] And I respect your principles too.
[1245.61] I don't even have an issue
with your strictness.
[1249.58] If this was the case,
things wouldn't have come to this point.
[1255.15] Anyway,
[1257.72] I have reached to a conclusion that I  am
going to keep my principles to myself only.
[1264.33] In this age, kids want  to do
everything according to their own will,
[1268.88] they want to make even the decisions
of their lives with full control.
[1274.56] That's the truth, Dad.
[1281.84] To me, this isn't right, but...
[1286.18] if this is what is happening
in the world then be it this way.
[1293.59] Now that I can't take decisions for you
 based on my principles,
[1303.44] that's why I want
to give this right to you both.
[1308.05] I... I didn't get it, Dad.
[1311.95] The boys that you both want to get married
to, ask them to bring their proposals.
[1318.74] I want to get you both married to them.
[1357.82] -Where is my money?
-What money?
[1360.69] Oh! now that your work is done
you are asking what money?
[1364.51] -Where is the money for Aima's job?
-Lower your tone.
[1368.47] I've told you, I will pay you
when Nosheen will give me.
[1370.35] Why did I become unwanted
[1374.89] Nobody knows that
[1379.60] Why did I become unwanted
[1384.18] Nobody knows that
[1393.52] Aima, why didn't you tell
dad everything clearly?
[1399.00] You should have told uncle.
[1403.67] I couldn't think of it,
I got really confused.
[1408.02] What is this, Aima?
[1409.29] Until you won't tell the truth how
is anyone going to know about it?
[1413.76] I didn't expect Nosheen to be there.
[1416.47] I thought that dad has called me
to hear the truth from me.
[1425.30] I didn't know that dad
would say this to me.
[1430.34] I just didn't know
how to react at that time.
[1436.48] She is right, Zaid.
[1439.90] Okay.
[1447.51] Why don't you go right now and talk to him?
[1453.79] By doing this, I would get
more suspicious in his eyes.
[1459.39] But why?
[1461.58] Obviously,
[1464.52] he would think that
[1466.40] if I was not interested in that guy,
why did I go to meet him at his flat?
[1471.36] Now what is this? You raise
questions yourself and answer them too.
[1473.89] Unless you tell dad, how are you
going to know what his response is?
[1477.00] And I am going to testify for you.
[1480.40] I know the whole truth.
[1483.16] By the way...
[1486.12] Zoya, I think Aima
should talk to him herself.
[1491.63] I's wish that it doesn't come to a point
that your witness is needed.
[1494.05] Do you see her condition?
[1496.31] How scared she is.
[1498.39] It is important for me to go with her.
[1501.07] Yeah, but try to understand,
[1503.50] Whatever she is going to say herself
would weigh more.
[1506.52] Because dad knows
that you are her best friend
[1508.28] and obviously you are
going to be on her side.
[1510.75] Okay.
[1512.65] Yes... yes, Zoya, he is right.
[1519.87] Now, don't waste anymore time
and go talk to him.
[1524.22] No, I can't do it right now.
[1529.83] -Why?
-Because dad isn't home.
[1534.07] He will be back by evening.
[1536.52] Okay, it's final then, as soon as dad gets
back home, you are going to talk to him.
[1540.78] And remember one thing,
[1542.96] we are with you, okay?
[1557.05] Really? I didn’t believe this.
What are you saying?
[1562.21] Yes, Mama, I have listened this
from my sinful ears myself.
[1566.73] Wow, your dad is going to melt so much,
[1570.20] I don't believe it.
[1571.81] He has no other option.
[1574.28] Nosheen, I think this
is the right time,
[1577.03] I'll talk about Hammad too,
may be He forgives him too.
[1579.76] Mama, Please!
[1581.72] Dad, has agreed after such difficulties
and you want to bring up a new issue.
[1587.01] Just start preparations for my wedding.
[1589.61] These things aren't done so quickly.
Tell that guy to send his parents first.
[1594.14] Mom, please, stop referring him
as "that guy". His name is Faisal.
[1598.15] What's so special in his name?
[1600.63] God forbid, but I don't have a good
experience with boys named Faisal.
[1605.58] Really? Did you have an affair 
with someone named Faisal?
[1610.89] Stop it! Do you think 
your mother is like that?
[1614.40] Oh, Mom, I was talking 
about before marriage.
[1617.52] I mean, before you got married.
[1621.67] There was this guy, who sent me 
an artificial ring saying it's a gold ring.
[1628.70] His name was Faisal too.
[1630.55] Come on!
[1632.26] If one Faisal conned you, that doesn't mean
all the Faisals in the world are con men.
[1637.38] I tell you, I have 
a really good experience with Faisal.
[1641.28] Okay, okay. I was saying just like that.
[1643.36] But this Faisal,
[1645.36] after listening his name, my sixth sense 
is warning me this guy Faisal...
[1647.99] Enough. You aren't a saint 
that you are getting intuitions.
[1652.02] And please start respecting him,
he is your would-be son-in-law.
[1657.36] Okay, okay, just hold on. 
No need to weave so many dreams,
[1662.41] We'll do his background check first.
[1664.90] After that your dad is
going to take a decision, okay?
[1668.52] I am telling you nothing 
of this sort is going to happen.
[1671.04] Dad has told me that whatever I want 
that's going to happen.
[1674.11] As soon as Faisal
brings the proposal,
[1675.90] we'll get engaged right
away and then married.
[1677.75] Oh, Nosheen, I just can't believe that
[1681.76] it has come to the point
[1682.90] where you are expressing your
choice so openly in front of your dad
[1687.64]  and getting married.
[1689.66] My name is Nosheen. I do the undo-able.
[1693.61] Anyway, tell me 
what's going to happen to Aima?
[1697.24] She doesn't even know that guy.
[1699.42] What will happen, Mama, 
she'll just keep crying.
[1703.85] If she says no, then she'll be in trouble
[1705.66] and if she says yes, where is
she going to get the guy from?
[1708.78] Means, between the devil and the deep sea.
[1713.65] Exactly, Mama.
[1715.06] Besides, as far as I care, 
she should go to hell.
[1718.58] Okay, okay, talk slowly.
[1721.53] Or else all the plan might get spoiled.
[1726.61] Okay, don't try to lecture me.
[1729.41] I am your mother, and I am experienced.
[1733.29] I know the world.
[1736.09] If you knew the world so well, you
would have taken care of your husband.
[1739.62] It's me who has tamed him.
[1742.24] Nosheen, it's useless 
to argue with you. My God!
[1806.48] -Hello, who is this?
-Oh, so that's how it's going to be now?
[1810.33] Neither my phone is going to be answered,
nor my voice is going to be recognized?
[1814.06] Oh, Amir, it's you.
[1816.41] I have been calling you for so
long, why weren't you answering?
[1819.47] I'm sorry, I was just busy with something.
[1822.43] These excuses have gotten old, 
think of something new.
[1824.78] Anyway, I answered your call, 
tell me what it is?
[1828.13] -Where is my money?
-What money?
[1830.89] Oh, now that your work is done
you are asking me what money?
[1834.68] Where is the money for Aima's job.
[1836.66] Lower your tone.
[1838.69] I have told you, I'll pay you as soon
as Nosheen send me the money.
[1840.88] It has been so many days
since I have done it,
[1843.01] how can it be that you haven't
received the payment yet?
[1844.96] Tell me clearly what you want to say.
[1846.83] That you have embezzled my money.
[1849.06] Is that what you think? 
Try to get it from me, now.
[1853.19] Faisal, I'm telling you, 
give me my payment.
[1855.85] Or else, what are you going to do?
Are you going to tell the police?
[1858.83] And what are you going 
to tell the police?
[1860.53] That I have blackmailed a girl 
and my partner has embezzled my share?
[1866.67] Stay in your limits, got it?
[1869.00] Means, you are not going to pay me?
[1871.24] Yes I won't pay you, 
do whatever you can, okay?
[1875.85] Okay.
[1883.67] What? None of the numbers is registered?
[1888.49] That's strange, man.
[1890.48] Okay, listen, please keep trying.
[1892.89] If, you know, you can track any location
or number then let me know please.
[1897.62] Thank you.
[1914.14] What did he get by defaming Aima?
[1917.38] He doesn't even know Aima.
[1924.05] Neither did he ask for any money.
[1926.55] Then why? Why did he do 
this enmity with Aima?
[1957.93] -Faisal, aren't you happy?
-For our marriage?
[1961.73] No Aima's marriage.
[1963.79] Yes, I am, I am really happy.
[1967.91] Isn't visible through your face though.
[1970.08] What do you mean? Are you going 
to taunt me on everything?
[1973.05] Anyway, tell me 
when are you going to send your family?
[1978.00] -Where?
-To my home with the proposal, you idiot.
[1981.43] Yes, I am going to send
them soon. Very soon.
[1985.34] How many days. Tell me the exact days.
[1989.11] When I have told you that I am
going to send them, then I'll send them.
[1992.52] Don't be so persistent on everything.
[1996.05] Why are you getting angry, Faisal?
[1998.13] Actually, I'm extremely very sorry.
[2001.49] I am going through a bit of problems, 
that's why I get angry easily.
[2006.08] What's wrong?
[2009.19] Actually, I need some money.
[2012.63] How much money?
[2015.01] Around 1,00,000/-.
[2017.70] A hundred thousand? Are you insane, Faisal?
I gave you a fifty thousand few days a go.
[2023.45] If it was about 10,000-15,000,
I could have thought of something.
[2027.30] I have to clear someone's dues.
[2030.76] Who is it and what dues?
[2032.94] I  don't know what do you 
keep yourself involved into, Faisal.
[2035.44] Just tell me if you can arrange 
a hundred thousand or not?
[2040.10] No.
[2049.83] Why did I become unwanted
[2054.46] Nobody knows that
[2056.73] Why did I become unwanted
[2063.86] Nobody knows that
[2069.35] I just want to tell you
everything honestly.
[2073.32] I can't see you being angry.
[2076.93] I’m not angry with you, Aima.
[2080.56] I'm just angry with me that I was
expecting more than required from you.
[2085.26] Don't hit me, don't hit me.
[2086.73] -You won't do it the easy way, will you?
-I'll tell you, don't hit me.
[2090.01] Look, I didn't do it myself. 
Someone had asked me to do it.
[2094.53] -Stop lying!
-I am telling you seriously,
[2096.51] -I was paid by someone to do it.
-Who paid you?
[2099.60] There is this guy, Faisal. 
He is a very cheap man.
[2103.23] -Faisal who?
-There is this guy.
[2106.45] And his girlfriend asked him 
to do all this.
