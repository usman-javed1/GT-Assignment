From flowers and from buds I have learnt to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you We do not have any brother 
that we can sit at home relying on him. -Yeah, Shabana is lucky in this regard.
-Yes. Now will you hang up? Okay, bye. Here. What's wrong, Zaid? You have made this
long face since you have arrived. -My face is like that.
-I know that very well, but just a second, show me your face. Seems like you have come 
after fighting a battle. You can say that is the case. 
My house is no less than a war-zone.  Why, now what happened? I mean, I don't know, 
since dad has started this second business, the whole environment
 of our house is changed. Restrictions all around the day. Where are you going, 
why are you going, whom are you meeting, 
why are you meeting him? It seems as if we will have 
to even breathe with his permission. Oh, God, really? Yes, man! I mean, can you imagine? He has
taken Nosheen's phone away  and forbidden her to go to college even. Reason? She was talking to some guy. -I mean, so what?
-What? I mean he took her out from college 
on such a petty issue? -I can't believe this.
-I don't either. Thank God, he isn't my dad. Even if he were, what could have you done? Either I would have run away 
from the house, or he would have disowned me by now. Oh come on, easier said than done. The option to walk out is just
in one relation, and that is marriage. Other than that, 
what you got is what you have. By the way,
 why didn't you bring Aima with you? Whose name did you just take. -Why, what did you do with her?
-I am mad at her the most. Oh, so you have fought with her as well? I went to aunt's to pick her up, aunt declined, 
but that girl sewed her lips too. I mean, she didn't insist even once. Zaid, she doesn't say a word as is. And specially she doesn't talk
 in front of elders. We know her that much. Okay, fine, let's talk about
something else. I'm getting angry. I know very well that your anger 
for her is just for a little while. Well, Zaid, may I say something? Please don't mind. -I don't like the environment of your house.
-Even I don't like it. I tell you, these parents... They have done everything in their times, and when it's our turn, 
they tend to be strict. I don't understand 
how you guys cope with it. I can't live in such an environment. Why are you stressing out, 
your mother is so chill. There is one rule at my house,
 live and let live. And because of that, I'm a free bird. I have the whole sky to fly. Really? And what if 
your would-be bounded you? Mm, firstly, I am not going
to marry such a person. And secondly, if any one tires to do so, then I'll break out from my cage, 
and fly away. Well, time will tell. You just started talking like an auntie. -Right, right.
-Have it. Cheer up, and drink it. Hey, Nosheen, come, sit down. No I won't sit,
 I just needed your cell phone. Cell phone? It was right here somewhere. So, now you don't even know 
where you cell phone is? No, actually mother was using it then... I don't know where she kept it. Oh, here it is. Battery is 10% only. 
You could at least keep it charged. Anyway, I'm going to return it in a while,
 just need to make a call. -Listen...
-What? You can call sitting here too. Why? What do you think, I am going
to run away with your cell phone? No, I... I didn't mean that. Don't worry, I'll return it in a while. What if dad sees her using my cell phone? He will lose his trust on me. Every thing all right, sister?
Are you feeling okay? A mother, whose one child has been thrown
 out of the home and other is about to be thrown out, how would she be? It's like troubles have become my fate. Don't worry, sister. 
Everything is going to be fine. Since the day Hammad has been disowned, I haven't slept peacefully
 even for a little while. Of course. I know what a mother goes through. Don't know how he would be living,
 if he has any money or not. Is it such a big crime 
to marry of one's own will? -No, sister.
-Then why did you separate him from me? What? -Me?
-Yes. Your brother promised you 
to get him married with Aima. Yes, sister, he did. And when Hammad didn't marry her, Then you must have cried and wailed a lot. Sister, you are taking me wrong. Hammad, Nosheen... are my own blood. They are my brothers' children. And the one who gave me shelter, loved  my daughter like a father does. Why would I want anything bad for him? Never. Well, only you know best 
what motive you have behind all this. I... I didn't come to this house 
with any sort of motive. My... compulsions brought me to this house. Compulsions... in which a woman... specially a mother... becomes helpless and without any support. I pray to God never to test any woman in such a way. May God keep her husband's
 shelter always on her head. Okay, now go and tell your brother 
all of it with exaggeration, so that we have a fight, and he makes our lives even more hell. Zaid,  you're here, and you didn't even tell me? What happened? How did it go? Hey... I'm talking to you. I don't want to talk to you. Zaid, what is wrong with you? 
What are you angry about? At least tell me that. Oh, how innocent, as if you don't know. Stop being a drama queen, Zaid, 
and tell me clearly what is up? Why didn't you come with me to Zoya's? Oh, God, Zaid. 
You are still stuck with that? You know it well why I didn't go. -Mother told me not to, in front of you.
-She told you not to go just once. Couldn't you insist? When she told me once not to go, 
why would have I asked again? Yes, obviously, a person asks again 
for something if he is willing to do it. But you didn't want to come 
with me yourself. Okay, and why would I want that? I don't know about that. But please, go
away from here for now, don't disturb me. Zaid, you are getting angry 
on such a petty issue for no reason. Oh, really, 
this is such a petty issue for you. Why bother then, end this discussion. You are just looking
 for a reason to be angry with me. I just don't like this habit of yours,
 getting angry on every other thing. You know what? 
I think you don't like me at all. Isn't it so? That's why
you haven't replied. Okay then, fine. Zaid, why are you being so childish? Don't twist the situation, Aima, answer me. Answer you for what? Firstly, why didn't you come with me? And secondly, do you like me or not? And I want the answers right now. Zaid I do not question 
my mother's decisions. When she forbade me once,
 I couldn't go then. Okay, fine, agreed. 
And what about the other question? Do you like me or not? It's just you, that I like. -Really?
-Yes. Why? Because... You are my... very... stubborn, angry and crazy friend. All right, all right, 
take all the advantage you can. You know well that I can't stay angry
 at you for much longer. Forgive me, please. I have told you my decision. You can go now. Why did I become unwanted {\an8}No one knows that Why did I become unwanted {\an8}No one knows that What is your problem? I have been calling you for so long, 
and you weren't picking up. They took my phone away. Stopped me from going to college as well. No, don't do you dare do this stupidity, 
this is my cousin's phone. Whenever I've to call 
I am going to call you myself . Okay, I'll hang up now. And remove
your phone from silent mode. Right now. Aima, don't you
have any manners? That if one is on the phone, you don't
barge in to his room like that. No, I... I just came to get my phone. And that's why you were eavesdropping? Look, I am not interested in eavesdropping,
 I just came to get my... Oh, what had happened if I had
taken your cell phone for a while? Nosheen, my phone is with you 
for the past two hours. Okay, so? Why so restless? Look, if you are done, give me my phone
back, I have to make an important call. Oh, wow, Aima. So much attitude? And it's not like you
are running a business that you have to make
important calls. Why are you arguing with me? Just give me my phone back and I'll leave. Here, and listen... remember one thing, that the clothes you wear, 
the food you eat, and all the stuff you use, those all are provided
by my dad, understood? Oh, and I might need your phone again until I make 
any other arrangement for myself. Go now, why are you still here? Look, someone is here to talk to you. Sorry, Dad. Dad, I'm really ashamed. Forgive me please. I have told you my decision. You can go now. If she is asking for forgiveness, 
why don't you pardon her then? She won't do it again. Dad, if Aima was in my place, 
wouldn't you have forgiven her? Now where did Aima come in all this? Dad, I know, you don't like me
 as much as you like Aima. But, Dad, after all the truth
is that I am your daughter. And no one can love you
as much as I do, Dad. This isn't a contest of love. Children loving their parents, 
taking care of them, one has to do it practically, 
not just say it. She learnt her lesson. Her studies are interrupted as well 
because of skipping college. Please, forgive me, Dad. 
I am asking for forgiveness. Forgiveness... Do you know the meaning of forgiveness? That the mistake is not
going to be repeated. Yes, Dad. Okay, I'm giving you a last chance. Just so that you can prove 
that you have come to your senses. Thank you, Dad. 
Thank you so much, I love you. Okay, I hope that you won't do anything due to which I
have to take any strict measures, or adopt a behaviour which you regret. Yes, Dad. Dad, my phone... Actually I have to discuss 
about assignments with my friends, so... It's in the drawer in my cupboard. Give it to her. Don't you dare do anything stupid now. I'm not going to save you next time. We'll see for next time, the next time. Mother, sometimes I think that... it would have been 
so nice had father been alive. Why do you say that? It isn't that bad even now. No, I didn't mean that. -Then?
-I mean to say that all three of use would have lived together in our house. Like a family. We would have had our own livelihood. We would have lived as we like. Aima, has anyone said anything to you? No, mother. Look, dear, I have told
you earlier as well. Don't feel bad 
because of these petty things. But one gets hurt, mother. Yes, I know. But, my child,
I'm here because of my brother. Because he has never
considered us as a burden. And never let us feel 
that we have no support. You are right. Dad loves more than father. And the truth is, I don't
remember father, that much. There are just some fogged memories, Like, after the evening walk, having an ice cream on our way back. Sliding down quickly on
the slide at the park, and landing straight in father's arms. Yes, dear, This is the philosophy of life, The moment which is right now here, just... just that's good. Dear, even if God has taken away 
your father from you, but He has put the love in brother's heart, the way your father would have loved you. Yes, mother, you are absolutely right. Dad has never let me feel 
the absence of father. He would never let you feel 
your father's absence in future as well. If God wills. Aima, come one get up, get up now. Wash your face. Come on. And listen, I don't like my daughter's face like this. I like her smiling and laughing. Come one, hurry up. Brother is refusing all the
proposals that are coming for Aima. I think that he is thinking
about Zaid for Aima. But if that happens then... So, how did your audition go? Mom, it went well. You know such weird girls
have come over there. They had no idea about how
to dress, or how to talk. My confidence boosted
after looking at them. Well, that's good then. Yeah, but, I didn't like the agency. -Why is that?
-I don't know. I didn't like the environment. Okay they forget it. Let's see. You tell me, 
how is your business going on? With God's grace, we have
lost some of out clients, but we are talking to
some new clients as well. Everything is going 
to be fine if God wills. Okay, sounds good. By the way, how is Auntie? I was listening to her 
problems over the phone. She just has only one problem, uncle! He has returned Nosheen's phone
 to her, just yesterday. Their family has really typical issues. Too many restrictions 
destroy the environment of a home. I don't want to, but you dad says
 to keep an eye on you. Really? And who is going
to keep an eye on you? Don't you wander all day long yourself? 
What do we know where you go? Why did I become unwanted {\an8}Nobody knows that Why did I become unwanted {\an8}Nobody knows that Specially daughters are
effected by it a lot. Mom, I'm going to take a nap. I have
to go for an other audition tomorrow. Sit down, I have to talk
 to you about something. What is it? Aren't you taking this hobby
of modeling a bit too serious? Mom, don't you get tired of saying
one thing over and over again? Because I want you
to get married. Oh, God, I knew you were going
 to talk about that. Doesn't my happiness matter to you? Dear, try to understand
my position as well. What position? -I am a single mother.
-So what? Well, life isn't as easy 
as you think it is. -What do you want to do, Mom?
-I mean, if I pass away tomorrow, what are you going to do then? Mom, please stop it, we can't have 
this emotional drama over and over again. I just want you to get married
 to a nice guy. You are getting proposals 
from such nice families, dear. I am fed up of refusing them. You want me to get married?
And what should I do then? Give birth to children 
and take care of the kitchen? And serve that husband and his mother? Mom, I can't do all this. 
I can't strangle my dreams like that. But you know what I think? You are going
to get happy only when I do so, right? The way you have described it, 
marriage isn't that scary. There is not much difference either. You will find out when you are going 
to consider somebody for that. Might be possible 
that he is your best friend. Friend? Are you pointing towards Zaid? It can be. -Mom...
-It's useless to talk to you. Mom, you... Okay, okay I'm sorry. You are thinking
of Zaid and me... Look, if you are going
to say things like that, I won't be able
to control my laughter. Zaid is just my friend. Okay fine, show me some options, I will meet them, talk to them, but... please don't you ever repeat
this thing with Zaid. Or else I won't be able
 to control my laughter. Mom, Zaid? Dad, can I sit with you? No need to ask, come, sit. -How are studies?
-Going great. Expecting my mid term results soon. -That's great, my God gives you success.
-Amen. You were complaining the other day
that I don't spend time with you. So I thought of sitting with you 
and have a chat. It's good that you came yourself,
 or else I would have come to you. Did you want me something to do? Well not that, 
but I wanted a favor from you. Instead think of it as a request. What are you saying, Dad? 
Why request, you can order me. No, no, it's just a request, but... First tell me, are you
 and Nosheen friends with each other? I mean how is your
relation with each other? I didn't get you. No, I mean, I think you both
don't go along well together. Yes you are right. We aren't friends. And what's the reason? I don't know the reason, 
but I feel that she doesn't like me. And maybe she doesn't approve 
of me living in this house either. You both have been raised in the
same house, under the same roof. You both had the same facilities, but... The way you both have been brought
up is a lot different, you know why? The reason is the way your mother 
has taught you her values and etiquettes. Which my Nosheen doesn't have,
 and that's why I'm really worried. I'm not home all day long, But being a father, I keep an eye
on every activity of my children. Father just order me,
what can I do for you? I just want that you try 
to be friends with Nosheen, get a little close to her. Teach her the etiquettes and ways 
that her mother hasn't taught her. And if you have a problem with that, 
you can always refuse to do it. I won't mind it at all. Dad, I have no issues
 in being friends with Nosheen. But may be she wouldn't want that, 
because she doesn't like me. -Did she say anything to you?
-No, Dad. At times without saying anything, we can make other's feel 
that we don't like them. You are right. That's the reason 
that she is a bit foolish. And ill-mannered,
and I want that you get close to her. If you befriend her I am always going 
to be indebted to you. Dad, don't worry. I'm going to try my best. Bless you. Thank God, no one saw me. Nosheen, where were you since morning,
 and when did you get back? I have been back since long, Mother. Tell me the truth, when did you get back? Why? Were you home 
that you would know when I came back? And what do you guys get in spying on me? Where are you coming from? 
And you didn't even go to college today? I went with a friend. I just don't get it, what are
these plans that are made daily,  and you guys don't
even get fed up of them. -Can't you talk slowly?
-You dad isn't home. Yes but his informers are. If they hear a scene will be created. Nosheen, just tell me 
if you are having an affair with some guy? Mother, it's very normal of a girl
and boy to be friends these days, and nobody minds it either. Stop it, Nosheen. I just know that you dad
doesn't approve of it at all, all right? Oh, just forget about dad. He doesn't approve of you much, either. Just shut up, Nosheen. 
This is your dad's house. And while living in a jungle,
 one doesn't mess with the lion. Well it doesn't take much time
 in sidelining an old lion? You should be ashamed of yourself, what
kind of words do you use for your dad? You are the one who started it.  I can't win an argument with you, Nosheen. Oh, Mother, if your interrogation is
over, please go and let me take rest. I am not interested either, it's your
dad who asks me to keep an eye on you. Really? And who will keep an eye on you? Don't you wander all day long?
What do we know where you go? What if the college has called
your dad on you being absent? I'm not that stupid, Mother. I have given them my number
 instead of dad's. And if they would have called, 
I would have asked some guy to attend it. Do you have any idea what you are doing? Please don't lecture me. I am doing 
the same that you did before you came. Just roam around, enjoy. You are such a sham less girl, do
you have the least bit of manners, what are you accusing your mother of? See? It felt bad, right? Now just imagine, when you all accuse me,
doubt me, how bad I feel? Go to hell. Carry on your
the silly things you do. The day your dad catches you, he is
going to marry you off right away. Don't come crying to me then. Zaid... Zaid I want a suggestion from you. Hmm? Dad has given me a very difficult task. Hmm. He wants me to befriend Nosheen. All right. What's right? I'm asking you how to approach Nosheen. Are you even listening, Zaid? Fine, if you are busy, I'll leave then. No, carry on, I was listening to you. Okay, then tell me what was I saying? Yeah, you are saying that... you want to be friends with Nosheen. Nice. Why do I want to be friends with Nosheen? No, no, actually dad has asked you that you stay with Nosheen, 
when she is alone. So, it's okay. No, I actually heard it,
 don't know where I'm wrong. What's so important that's
going on over the phone, huh? -Let me see.
-Aima, give me my phone back. -Or else?
-This isn't a joke, give me my phone back. There is a limit, man. There is
something called privacy. Such a nerve... What's so important in that phone? You have no regard of anybody's privacy. It can be something important. What the hell... Okay, sorry. Hey, listen. Why did I become unwanted {\an8}Nobody knows that Why did I become unwanted {\an8}Nobody knows that Brother, what if Aima
 has committed suicide? Just shut up, Nosheen. 
Say something nice for once. Just don't worry, sister.
 I'll go and ask her. Why would I worry? And if she does something silly, 
hen I'm telling you we shouldn't be blamed. -Aima!
-What is this madness? -Why are you taking the trouble on you?
-Auntie I think we will have to break the door. Are you mad? You will be trapped, 
the police is going to arrest you. What the hell are you talking about. If something happens to Aima,
 I won't spare anyone. -God knows, what this...
-Aima!
