[0.00] From flowers and from buds
[4.54] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.13] When I saw you
[14.08] I learned how to chirp from you
[18.91] I'm Nosheen, and this is my house.
[23.33] I'm really sorry, I thought
my auntie lives here.
[28.19] She lives with us.
[30.57] Didn't you see how that lady
was praising her niece?
[38.22] I mean, okay everybody has some qualities.
[43.74] But why did she need to praise her so much?
[47.08] I don't know, I'll change.
I wish I could go somewhere.
[52.28] Well, if you want you can join us.
[55.77] What happened? Where is she?
[59.83] With Faiq and Aima.
[63.56] With God's will.
[65.80] I just wish that may God keep them
really happy. May he gives them good fate.
[73.23] Amen.
[76.66] Have you guys seen Nosheen?
[79.05] Nosheen? Isn't she home?
[82.21] I didn't see her since evening.
I thought she might be in her room.
[85.31] But now I have looked for her in
the whole house but I can't find her.
[89.88] So I thought of asking you both.
[93.16] Call her and ask.
[95.88] Why don't you call her.
I can't find my phone right now.
[109.41] Hello, Nosheen, where are you?
[113.51] Dinner? With whom?
[119.56] All right, okay.
[122.98] What happened? Where is she?
[126.91] She is with Faiq and Aima.
[132.12] Auntie, did Aima tell you
that Nosheen is going with them?
[135.15] No she didn't tell me about it.
[139.18] Just Faiq and Aima were
going, that's all I know.
[144.12] I'll ask her when she returns.
[146.18] Somebody must have asked her.
How can she go like that?
[149.88] She is not a child anymore.
[165.35] Look, Zaid is saying that his
wedding reception and Aima's wedding day
[171.10] should be on the same day.
That's his wish.
[173.28] And I think there is nothing
wrong with that either.
[177.12] If both the children want that,
then we'll have to agree.
[180.00] By the way, you can discuss
it with you sister in law.
[182.68] Brother, she has no objection.
[185.27] She has left the decision
of choosing a date on me.
[188.59] Well, then there shouldn't be any issue.
[191.19] It's my son's wedding too,
my consent is important as well.
[195.30] You are here right now
[198.38] and it's being
discussed in front of you,
[200.64] so if you have any
objection you can say it.
[203.37] It's not necessary that you
fulfill all desires of children.
[206.75] If it's his desire, even then
what is wrong with that, tell me?
[211.89] If both the kids together...
[213.67] Look, I mean they will
get married the same day.
[217.26] There can be a hundred different problems,
[219.96] how are you going to
marriage two events at a time?
[224.71] There is going to be mismanagement,
in fact something unpleasant may happen.
[228.70] Why don't you do one thing? The dates may
be close but the events shall be separate.
[235.26] It would be a little easier for us.
[239.12] You are right. Shabana, what do you say?
[246.26] I think sister is right.
[249.19] Okay listen, there isn't much time left.
[253.55] When these few months
are going to end you'll never know.
[257.32] That's why please start
preparing for Aima's dowry.
[261.15] Yes, brother.
[264.72] I'm going to help, Shabana.
I'll take her with me.
[269.44] Besides, I am aware of the markets
and I can give her proper advice.
[274.51] Aima is our own daughter,
and Shabana isn't well as is.
[279.57] She won't be able to go
to the markets alone.
[281.94] Almas I think it's better that
you focus on Zaid's wedding.
[287.11] You were saying that we
should shift in the new home,
[290.90] so I have to focus on
the construction too.
[295.50] And should concentrate on the renovation you
are getting done these days and other things.
[301.53] First get it completed,
we'll take care of the rest later.
[303.59] Then you will be in a new place,
it won't be any problem then.
[308.59] Shabana will manage herself. Okay?
[311.19] Where I'm doing so many other things,
I can help Shabana too.
[316.68] Aima is going to go.
I'll send Aima with Shabana.
[319.80] She will take whatever she wants.
[323.34] -Okay, Shabana?
-All right, brother.
[326.69] -Let me make a list of the things first.
-Fine.
[330.66] Did you ask your sister in law
what she needs in dowry?
[339.67] I don't find it appropriate
asking her this. Sister,
[349.02] Look, I'm just saying that in your favor.
[351.61] This way you'll know if they want any dowry
or not. And if they do what do they want?
[359.18] Besides, she is Aima's auntie,
[361.27] and by looking at their splendor it
doesn't seem right that they ask for dowry.
[367.50] Either Nimra wants dowry or not
it doesn't make any difference to us.
[371.63] -Instead of taking useless things...
-Look, telling them,
[374.62] if they agree or not,
we shouldn't be concerned with that.
[378.82] And besides, even if they
want any dowry,
[381.12] then we would still give Aima
what we have to at her wedding.
[388.74] Yeah.
[402.55] What happened, Zaid?
Why are you sitting so worried here?
[407.70] Nothing, Dad, just like that.
[412.36] I know you're worried
because you're getting married, right?
[416.26] No, not at all. I'm not worried about
marriage at all. In fact I'm happy.
[422.91] But, yeah I'm a little anxious
[425.51] if I will be able to take care
of my relationships properly.
[428.83] I can understand.
[430.83] I've been through it.
[434.63] By the way, what do you think?
Is Zoya a good match for you?
[440.72] Of course, dad, I'm really happy with Zoya.
And I'm sure we'll do great.
[446.65] And besides the
relationship we have,
[449.31] our friendship, that is
rarely found in couples.
[453.94] Look, son, it's nice that you
are confident about your decision
[458.85] but you can look away from the truth.
[462.27] What truth, Dad?
[463.72] Zaid, this friendship,
[465.83] pre-marriage and post-marriage friendship
is very different from each other.
[470.02] I'm telling this from my experience.
[473.47] Just friendship can't make
a marriage successful,
[477.43] Because the friendship is
limited to just two people,
[481.07]  where as marriage
isn't limited just two,
[483.96] Then what is it that strengthens
the relationship of marriage, Dad?
[487.19] There are a few things,
but to me
[490.46] husband and wife should
have the sense of responsibility.
[496.24] It would be better that you both
fulfill your responsibilities properly.
[501.26] If you decide that, you won't
have any problem in future.
[505.90] Yes, Dad, we are discussing that.
[509.77] By the way, Dad, what do you think?
Am I going to become a good husband?
[514.74] Yes, I have started seeing
your sense of responsibility now.
[518.92] Then why are you worried?
[520.89] I'm not worried about you. Anyway...
[526.20] Forget it.
[527.45] Dad, why do I get a feeling
that you don't think much of Zoya?
[534.39] It's nothing like that. Look,
Zoya is one of our own,
[537.37] she is your cousin,
why would I have any objection on her?
[541.37] Still, Dad, I feel like you don't
reveal your opinion about that.
[545.42] No, no, it's not like that.
She is a good girl.
[549.42] Then what is it, Dad?
[553.21] Zaid, although I left your
decisions on you guys,
[557.84] I gave you all the authority.
[559.77] But as a father, it's my duty.
[563.34] I think about you.
[566.98] I analyze the decisions you kids take 
through my experience.
[570.92] That's why I'm worried.
[574.33] There is something, Dad. 
Don't you like my and Zoya's relationship?
[579.02] No, no, I've accepted it, but...
but still, dear...
[586.15] Look, I just want that you avoid
those mistakes in your married life
[592.39]  that I have faced.
[595.50] Dad, you're talking to me. To your son.
[598.94] Whatever is in your heart, please
say it without hesitation. I won't mind.
[603.01] I...
[605.95] Zoya seems a little irresponsible to me,
and I've observed
[609.37] that she doesn't have the ability
or the interest to take responsibility.
[616.66] And it isn't easy to run a household.
[621.90] Housekeeping, husband, in-laws, 
one has to take care of everyone.
[627.35] Every relation 
has it's own set of responsibilities.
[629.82] It's really important 
to take every thing along.
[634.17] I'm just trying to teach you that I have
learned from my unsuccessful married life.
[640.26] Why are you saying that, Dad?
[642.18] Because my marriage 
is an unsuccessful marriage.
[646.64] One of us hasn't fulfilled 
their responsibility
[648.95] and you can see yourself
what are the consequences of it.
[655.81] Where is your brother today? You sister..
[660.29] Anyway, forget it.
[662.83] You should teach Zoya 
how to take responsibility.
[670.38] Look at Aima, she is the same age as hers.
[672.85] But still she has 
the qualities to run a household.
[677.46] But, Dad, not everyone is the same.
[679.80] I mean, sure Zoya's values
and habits are different from Aima
[684.06] but don't worry, we'll make it work.
[688.72] I'm hopeful
[690.99] that you can fulfill your
responsibilities too,
[693.25]  and you'll convince her to do so as well.
[695.21] -Anyways, you don't need to worry.
-Not at all.
[698.71] Come let's have a nice coffee, come on.
[732.80] What have you done, Aima?
Who told you to act so intelligent?
[738.51] What do you mean?
[740.99] Why did you take Nosheen along? This
was supposed to be your special moment.
[746.15] And you involved Nosheen in it?
[749.56] You're so stupid.
[752.03] Zaid, at least don't blame me.
[755.00] Really? Who else should I blame?
[758.77] I didn't even know 
that she is coming with us.
[767.86] When I went to the car 
she was already sitting inside.
[776.00] This girl is getting clever 
more than required.
[782.17] She thinks that if no one is
going to pay attention to her
[785.09] then she is going to do whatever she likes.
[786.83] I'll take care of her.
[787.97] Zaid, please, please
don't say anything to her.
[791.63] A mountain of a mole hill
will be maid for no reason.
[793.95] For no reason? 
Is this something small for you?
[797.15] You should have got her out of the car, 
or called me or dad.
[802.66] Zaid, we aren't kids anymore that
we take small complaints to our elders.
[809.32] And besides Faiq was there,
may be Nosheen went with his consent.
[822.00] I really feel ashamed 
calling her my sister.
[827.46] I know that she is used to create a scene,
[832.07] she is used to seek attention.
[834.99] But don't say anything to her.
[836.77] Just let it go and end this discussion.
[843.92] Anyway, how was you day?How was Faiq?
[850.08] Faiq? Faiq was nice.
[853.38] We talked about a lot of things.
[858.28] Yeah right, you talked 
about a lot of things.
[860.68] What would have you guys talked
about in presence of that witch, Nosheen.
[865.67] We talked as much as we could.
[870.60] Anyway for get it, I'm glad, 
I'm really happy for you.
[877.77] Phew, Nosheen.
[882.17] So, when are you meeting him again?
[887.01] Yeah, you're right. It's just that 
brother has made my life hell.
[892.33] He has been a headache to me all the time.
[896.11] Nosheen,
[899.24] -I have to talk to you.
-I'm busy right now.
[902.96] -What do you think?
-What the hell?
[904.07] That if we don't remind you that
doesn't mean that we all have forgotten.
[907.88] Are you going to do whatever you want?
[910.42] Have you forgotten what you have done?
[912.53] -Who the hell are you to forgive me?
-Behave yourself, both of you.
[916.85] You guys keep fighting wildly all the time.
[919.53] Mama, does she even deserve 
that one should behave well with her?
[923.03] Oh, hello, mister. You are the one 
who came here to talk to me.
[925.75] So behave yourself 
and give me my phone back.
[928.36] Just wait a minute, Zaid. What's wrong? 
Why are you getting angry on her?
[930.67] Mama, actually you should be 
the one getting angry on her.
[933.49] But why, Zaid? Tell me.
[935.13] The thing she has done...
[936.58] I don't have time to
listen to this nonsense.
[938.22] Mama, tell him to return my phone.
[940.14] Mind your language. 
Would you like to get slapped at your age?
[944.08] Give her phone. Zaid, 
give her phone. Give it to me.
[947.40] -Give it. 
-You're not doing right.
[949.46] Take it.
[950.07] You have spoiled her. It's your
support only that she is doing all this.
[953.85] Will somebody tell me what she has done?
[956.87] She tagged along on Aima's date.
[958.82] Aren't you ashamed 
of interfering anybody else's date?
[961.50] -What? I interfered?
-Yeah who else?
[964.57] You both keep your voices low.
[966.71] I won't keep my voice
low. I'm not afraid of anyone.
[969.24] And who told you 
that I went as an uninvited guest?
[972.86] She is lying, Mama. 
Aima hadn't invited her.
[975.55] Who is talking about your Aima?
It was Faiq who invited me.
[979.35] -Faiq?
-You liar, why would he ask you?
[982.17] He doesn't even know you.
I don't believe her, she is lying.
[984.97] Am I lying? Let me call Faiq, 
everything will be cleared then.
[988.66] -What are you doing?
-I'm making you guys hear the truth as I am a liar.
[993.82] Mama, stop her, look what is she doing?
[1000.05] Faiq, tell me, who asked me 
to come with you and Aima?
[1005.79] Just answer me please, Faiq.
[1010.48] Okay, thanks, bye.
[1012.28] I hope everything is clear to you guys now.
[1014.59] And you, stay away from my life.
[1019.55] Did you see her, Mama?
[1022.00] Didn't she clear everything? 
Faiq invited her and she accepted.
[1026.14] What's the big deal in it, Zaid?
[1054.72] Hello, yeah, what's up?
[1058.18] I thought all is well at your end.
[1060.59] No, man, nothing's well.
[1063.54] Why? What happened?
[1065.91] There was a huge scene created at home.
[1069.33] Your family is really conservative.
[1072.13] They didn't like me going 
with you and Aima.
[1077.21] What's there to mind in it?
[1080.02] -There isn't but...
-But what?
[1083.21] -I don't understand how to tell you this.
-Tell me whatever it is.
[1087.81] Aima created a big scene when she got back.
[1090.57] She told everyone 
that I forced you guys to take me.
[1093.96] And then what, everyone was after me.
[1096.64] I went just like that, 
and that too because you asked me to.
[1100.78] Yeah, but I think this isn't 
that big an issue.
[1103.86] If you say, should I talk to Aima?
[1106.60] No, no. Don't say anything or there are
going to be more problems created for me.
[1113.00] You just cleared it 
over the phone, that's enough.
[1117.33] Okay fine. So, what are you up to?
[1119.94] I just got done 
dealing with all this issue.
[1122.95] Your fiance is just...
[1126.51] You are stuck at the wrong place.
[1128.62] Sorry, I hope you didn't mind.
[1132.16] No, it's not like that.
[1135.24] Okay listen, should I tell you 
something interesting?
[1149.67] No, no, I told you to keep it ready.
[1153.02] The driver is coming
to you in half an hour. Okay.
[1161.93] -Greetings, Mom.
-Greetings, where was my son all day?
[1167.35] I'm sorry, Mom. I had
to go to a meeting,
[1170.48] when I got back I got a call,
so got a little busy.
[1173.87] -Was it Aima?
-No.
[1177.29] Then who?
[1179.71] It was a friend's call, that's why.
[1182.08] You didn't tell me 
how your date with Aima go?
[1186.04] What did you guys talk about? And
most importantly, how did you like Aima?
[1191.29] She's fine, she's nice.
[1194.98] What is it, Faiq? It doesn't seem so 
by the way you said it.
[1198.06] Whatever it is in your
heart tell that to me honestly.
[1201.07] Mom, you know 
that I'm an open-minded person.
[1206.18] I think that Aima is 
of a little orthodox mentality.
[1209.96] Means, if tomorrow I talk 
to my friends she might mind it.
[1215.00] Besides, Mom, 
I don't like such girls anyways.
[1220.13] But if you have selected her, 
then she must be something.
[1225.42] Dear, noble girls are usually 
shy like that. They don't talk much.
[1231.54] Yes, but one can tell their likes and dislikes
by being within the limits of nobility.
[1240.35] I know it very well 
that she doesn't talk much.
[1246.71] It's in her nature to stay quiet.
[1248.60] But if you are going to give her some time,
she'll get completely normal with you.
[1252.74] -It takes time for some girls to get frank.
-How much more time, Mom?
[1256.83] You know since the day our marriage
is fixed, she hasn't contacted me once.
[1262.08] She could have contacted me herself.
[1264.36] But I feel like she isn't giving me 
a chance to understand her.
[1269.56] Okay, let's do one thing, Faiq. I've
invited Aima's family over lunch tomorrow.
[1274.92] You can talk to her privately.
[1277.57] And I'm sure there must be  
a misunderstanding between you two.
[1283.16] You can tell her that
you would really like
[1285.96] if she calls you herself and
asks about your well being.
[1289.99] Okay, Mom.
[1291.94] Faiq, I have sincerely 
got you both together.
[1297.27] I have considered a lot of
other girls for you,
[1300.38] but as a daughter-in-law only
Aima seemed suitable for you.
[1304.36] And I'm sure, Mom, 
 your choice can never be wrong.
[1309.29] With God's will.
[1310.16] -Now please, order some tea, I'll have tea and leave.
-All right. Akbar!
[1320.74] Sister Nimra where is 
our dear Faiq? Didn't see him.
[1325.76] He just got back from a meeting. 
He'll be here after freshening up.
[1331.89] Oh, all right.
[1333.26] And how is my daughter doing?
[1335.16] -I'm doing good, and you?
-I'm good too.
[1338.51] I just got a little tired 
as I was in the kitchen since morning.
[1341.28] You should have called me, 
I would have helped you out.
[1343.46] You have to take care 
of all this when you're here.
[1346.12] I can do it until I can.
[1350.85] Auntie, where is the washroom?
[1353.32] -Let me take you.
-No, just let me know, I'll go by myself.
[1358.25] Okay, go yourself then.
[1360.11] Faiq's room is on the right, 
and guest room is on the left.
[1362.99] You can use the washroom there.
[1364.79] Okay, fine. Thanks.
[1385.61] Nosheen, you here?
[1386.82] Actually I wanted to use the bathroom
and I came to your room by mistake.
[1393.78] I hope you didn't mind.
[1396.07] No, it's okay. 
Sorry, I intruded your privacy.
[1402.79] By the way, there is a washroom 
in the other room too, you could have gone there.
[1406.45] Yeah, I'll go.
[1410.02] Wow, guitar?
[1415.75] Do you know how to play a guitar?
[1419.53] No I used to play when in college, 
so I bought one.
[1422.68] Okay. I'm sure you must have broken 
a lot of girls' hearts.
[1427.93] No, it's not like that.
[1429.75] Will you teach me how to play a guitar?
[1434.44] I never learned it myself. 
I just bought it because I liked to play.
[1438.60] Means you don't 
want to teach me how to play.
[1445.44] -Okay, no problem, I'll teach you.
-Sure.
[1450.26] Can you please take my picture?
I'll have my today's DP.
[1455.51] Nosheen, I'll take your picture later. 
Everyone is waiting outside.
[1459.05] Okay, fine.
[1463.29] Had Hussein been alive today, 
he would have been the happiest.
[1468.54] You are absolutely right, brother.
[1471.07] I miss brother Hussein every moment.
[1474.61] And he would have been 
the happiest on this union. It's just...
[1478.35] He would be happy right
now too, sister, Nimra.
[1483.25] He really thought 
of you as someone very close.
[1488.04] To tell you the truth, Shabana,
when I meet you and Aima
[1491.14]  I feel like I'm meeting my brother.
[1496.94] Hussein was very dear to me.
[1500.39] May he rest in peace.
[1504.66] Let's change the topic, I've made everyone
emotional by talking about Hussein.
[1512.71] Brother, even if our dear ones leave,
their memories don't leave our hearts.
[1517.87] It seems as if they are with us.
[1520.75] You're right, that's how it is.
[1524.49] Now where is this boy?
[1528.46] Oh!
[1530.42] See, Shabana, Faiq had asked me to iron his
shirt and I kept sitting here and forgot.
[1534.97]  He must be waiting I'll be right back.
[1536.34] Sister, why are you going?
[1538.36] Aima's here, she'll iron the shirt.
[1541.50] Auntie, just tell me, I'll iron it.
[1545.00] -No, no, you keep sitting.
-No, Aima will do it. She irons really well.
[1549.32] Go ahead, dear.
[1550.71] Okay, fine. Go Aima, 
you'll have to do it in future too.
[1554.66] You go and iron his shirt.
[1558.23] -Where's the shirt?
- In Faiq's room. Go.
[1572.96] Oh, no, mama didn't even iron it.
[1575.42] Hey let me iron it.
[1577.48] No, Nosheen it's okay. I'll do it myself.
[1580.50] Faiq it's just a shirt, let me do it.
[1583.15] It'll take just two minutes, 
I'll do it, no problem.
[1585.53] -Faiq, I'll do it...
-I told you...
[1599.90] Aima!
[1604.93] I had to iron my shirt, so, Nosheen...
[1608.99] Yeah, I told him that I'm going to iron it.
[1614.14] Actually, auntie, sent me to do that.
[1617.24] Yeah, so Nosheen will iron it, 
till then come in we can talk.
[1623.92] No, what is she going to do here?
[1626.99] Why don't you go to the kitchen and
help auntie? She must be working alone.
[1630.96] No, that's not an issue. 
Mom is used to work alone.
[1635.32] Aima, come in.
[1637.39] No, I've got something 
to do in the kitchen.
[1641.45] I told you she won't sit here.
[1645.59] I know my cousin better than you.
[1647.84] Okay, let me iron the shirt now.
[1655.82] Sister, even after so many years 
food made by you is still amazing.
[1660.45] The same taste. It was so delicious.
[1663.14] Shabana is right, the food 
was so good that  I overate, believe me.
[1669.01] Having green tea was necessary right now.
[1671.12] Thank you so much.
[1672.69] It's enough for me that you
liked the food. My hard work paid off.
[1682.54] Auntie, specially
the kebabs were really good.
[1688.20] Will you teach me how 
to make such kebabs? Please?
[1697.02] Sure, why not, dear? 
Are you fond of cooking?
[1700.30] Oh yes, other than traditional dishes 
like Qorma and biryani
[1705.52] she makes really good pizza and lasagne.
[1711.04] That's really good that she 
has learned all that in this age.
[1715.36] Yeah, I have this rule that girls should
learn how to cook by the age of 18.
[1721.76] Without compromising on their education.
[1730.88] Nosheen is Aima's age right?
[1733.05] No, she is two years younger than Aima.
[1736.65] Really? What are you studying?
[1741.78] You should as what she doesn't study.
[1749.70] She has books around her
all the time.
[1751.99] So much so that she even makes
dishes from recipes from magazines.
[1756.20] No, I meant to ask that which institute
does she go to? What's her qualification?
[1762.78] Actually, I'm giving exams 
on private basis, for A-levels.
[1770.11] But why private? Why didn't you
take admission in some good college?
[1773.86] Actually, auntie, my time
was getting wasted in college.
[1777.07] Colleges these days focus
more on parties and events
[1781.10] and I'm not involved 
in all this, that's why.
[1784.61] Actually me and Azmat let
kids decide in such matters.
[1790.96] No matter if it's about studies, 
career or marriage.
[1794.92] That's really great.
[1797.38] -Is your younger son coming for the wedding?
-Just don't ask about him.
[1801.92] He is settled there. And says that I
don't want to come to Pakistan at all.
[1805.75] Well, I think he's right. 
What is left here.
[1809.84] No, whatever it is. Our country is our own.
[1814.50] Yes, sister, ask Asim, 
he must come for the wedding.
[1821.04] Yes, Shabana is
absolutely right about that.
[1825.76] By the way, why don't you choose
a girl for your younger son too?
[1829.05] They both will get married at the expense
of one and their homes will be settled too.
[1833.26] Let the ones who are getting
married, get married first.
[1839.04] No, actually my younger son 
doesn't intend to get married right now.
[1843.09] So when he wants to
get married, we'll see then.
[1845.67] Yes, you are right.
[1847.73] Besides, there is no issue with boys.
[1851.02] Mothers are usually
worried about their girls.
[1857.74] Because, you see, you never know what kind
of husband she gets, how the in laws are?
[1861.43] By the way, Shabana 
is really lucky in this regard.
[1867.76] I just wish that I get my daughter's
mother in law just like you are.
[1877.77] That's your greatness.
[1888.71] Aima, what is it? You're really quite.
[1892.78] No, it's nothing, I'm fine.
[1895.66] Yeah, when her fiance is outside,
why would she like it between the elders?
[1923.85] Zaid, I think, auntie is forcing Zaid 
to marry me, he doesn't like me.
[1931.32] Nosheen, everything all right? 
You called so early in the morning?
[1933.65] Yeah, actually I was getting bored, 
so I thought of calling you.
[1937.67] Mom, I'm going to Dubai for a shoot.
[1942.15] Dubai?
[1944.11] Your dad has given permission
for you to join college again.
[1949.81] Really?
[1950.82] I have booked an apartment for Aima.
[1957.21] And I've opened a bank
account for her personal use.
[1961.07] So, these are all the documents for those.
