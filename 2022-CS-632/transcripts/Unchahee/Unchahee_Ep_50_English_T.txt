[0.00] From flowers and from buds
[4.57] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.16] When I saw you
[14.30] I learned to chirp from you
[18.81] But you always stay so
chilled out, what's wrong today?
[22.75] Did your wife throw you out of the house?
[26.35] -You guessed it right.
-Oh, no problem.
[30.84] If she threw you out then go back to her.
[33.72] Dad, I wanted to talk
to you about something.
[38.25] Sure, go ahead. I have to talk to you too.
[42.11] But you go first.
[45.32] I was just thinking Dad that
[49.16] for everyone's benefit, I take
Zoya and move out from here.
[54.66] Auntie, tell your son to stop.
[57.63] -Is everything all right? What happened?
-Your son is fooling around with girls.
[62.05] How can you say that?
[63.95] Whatever I'm saying is the truth.
[65.62] He keeps talking to girls all day long,
meet them privately and what not.
[70.52] Nosheen, how can you talk
like that about your husband?
[73.90] I'm not just accusing him. I
have proof of all his cheap deeds.
[78.74] Anyway, listen, have you
told anyone about me at home?
[83.30] No, brother, I have
buried this secret in me.
[88.89] Thank you.
[90.14] By the way, brother, why do you
hide that you are in touch with me?
[95.68] I just don't want that anybody
gets to know anything about me.
[100.51] So won't you ever return home?
[105.60] I think , brother, dad
is going to forgive you.
[108.77] I know his stubbornness quite well.
[113.87] He won't forgive me so easily.
[117.86] At least try, what if things work out?
[124.32] But why are you hiding it from mom?
[126.90] She would be really happy to
know that you are in touch with me.
[130.25] Nosheen you know how simple mama is.
[134.52] She can never keep anything from
dad. That's why I have stopped you.
[139.34] Okay fine, I won't tell her as well.
[142.92] Anyway, I think you're getting late.
[146.83] Your husband must be
getting worried. I'll drop you.
[151.12] Sure, let's go, it's getting too late.
[178.80] -Greetings, mother.
-Greetings.
[183.20] Mother, can I get a cup of tea. 
I'm really tired today.
[186.97] Okay, I'll make you one. But before
that I'd like to say something to you.
[190.90] Sure, go ahead.
[192.47] No, nothing important,
but it's been so many days
[195.82] you didn't tell me about
your engagements.
[198.26] What engagements, mother?
[202.63] I stay busy at the restaurant all
day between managers and employs.
[207.39] And I'm getting a really
good response, you know.
[209.83] And I am thinking of
opening a second branch.
[213.69] That's really great.
One must keep struggling.
[219.09] Mother, do you want to say something?
[222.88] Nothing. You didn't tell me,
 you went to meet your friend.
[229.76] How did it go?
[231.65] I twas nice, I had fun.
[237.64] Mother if you wasn’t to say
something, you can say it directly.
[241.12] Faiq, Nosheen was telling me
[244.37] that these days you are
talking to some girl all the time.
[249.64] She told it to you too?
[254.66] God!
[255.87] Mother, this girl has lost
her mind, it's nothing else.
[258.51] Faiq, if she is saying it
with so much confidence,
[260.62] there must be something that she felt.
[262.87] Mother, it's nothing like that.
And you know Sania very well.
[268.03] You remember she was in school with me?
With whom I used to do combined studies?
[275.32] Yes there was that girl...
[276.93] Yes, the same. Who invited us
over for dinner at her place too
[279.56] and her father used to be in the army too.
[281.89] Oh, that girl!
[283.53] I just found her on social
media after such a long time
[286.19] and I went to meet her, that's it.
[288.04] And don't know what
this crazy girl is assuming.
[290.33] Very bad, Faiq. Don't use such words
for Nosheen, after all she is your wife.
[298.15] It's your duty to give respect to her.
[301.10] Okay, fine. Sorry.
[302.48] Faiq, if Nosheen has a doubt on
anything then sit with her and talk.
[307.38] Try to make her understand.
[309.57] And tell her about Sania
that she is just your friend.
[312.30] Mother, I can't give her
justifications of everything,
[315.17] let her think whatever she wants.
[316.85] Every person thinks differently.
[319.97] Well then let her think whatever
she wants, that's not my responsibility.
[323.75] Faiq, she is your wife, you responsibility.
[329.26] After all you have married her.
[331.59] Oh, God. Mother, I'm fed up.
[334.78] Faiq try to understand.
[337.60] Don't try to incite the issue. If
Nosheen has a doubt let her meet Sania.
[342.58] And what's going to happen then?
[344.48] When she will meet her,
her misconception will be cleared.
[349.00] Do one thing, invite Sania over for dinner.
[352.13] They both can meet each other,
[353.73] this way Sania won't have
any misunderstanding either.
[356.65] Mother, Sania is really broad
minded, and she can't even think of that.
[363.05] And I think inviting her over
to our home is not a good idea.
[368.13] All right, Faiq, do
whatever you think is right.
[371.33] I just feel that by doing this,
[373.86] the distance between you
two might be decreased.
[377.09] And if she will meet your friend's circle
the her habit to doubt you might stop.
[390.57] -Okay, I'll make tea for you.
-Sure.
[403.93] Very good, auntie has
given a very good suggestion
[406.86] Yes, but I think that calling Sania
over to home won't be appropriate.
[410.66] Why so? You've said yourself
that Sania is a very nice girl.
[414.01] And you don't get any
bad vibes from her either,
[415.71] then what is wrong in
inviting her to your home?
[417.19] -You are not getting my concern.
-Then tell me.
[421.56] Actually I don't have an issue with
Sania, but I am afraid about Nosheen.
[428.80] Earlier when she saw Sania's
messages in my cell phone she went crazy,
[431.29] and now if she will see me with her, I
don't know how she is going to react.
[434.95] She won't do anything. 
Just call Sania home.
[438.32] How can you say that?
[439.76] You can inform her that
SAnia is coming before hand.
[447.11] And no one misbehaves with a guest.
[451.14] You think that there is
going to be no problem?
[454.05] Yes. In fact I think that the misunderstanding
between you two will be cleared as well.
[459.98] I just don't get why you are so confused?
[463.40] Actually, Salman, Sania is
a very good friend of mine.
[466.88] And I don't want to spoil my
friendship with her because of Nosheen,
[469.88] Nothing will happen. You are over-thinking.
[474.24] Anyway, forget it. Tell me I have to
get the interior changed of the restaurant.
[478.72]  I didn't really like the previous one.
[480.56] I have talked to a guy. 
No, don't talk to anyone right now.
[485.00] Why so? We don't have much time.
[487.34] We have to get the interior
changed as soon as possible.
[489.58] Actually I have already talked to Sania.
[493.02] Yes, she has done a course too and
her aesthetic sense is very nice as well.
[498.71] Okay.
[500.02] Yes. That's why I thought
that I'll get it done by her.
[503.75] Okay then I'll focus on other things.
[507.36] Yeah, that's fine. You start
hiring as soon as possible.
[511.32] No matter if people ask you for higher
salary, just hire them, money is no issue.
[515.62] Don’t worry, you will get a good staff.
[518.28] But I can ask Sania also, she
can help you with that as well.
[522.96] Really? How?
[524.51] Actually, Sania has a cousin 
who runs a group.
[527.59] And different jobs are posted there.
[531.21] I think we can find some
good people from there.
[534.03] Hmm, good idea.
[538.33] What's wrong? What are you thinking?
[540.29] I was thinking that you could ask Sania,
[542.90] she might have some information
about restaurant management too.
[545.97] Oh, come on, Salman. If anyone can be
of some use for us what's wrong with that?
[550.65] Nothing. I was saying just like that.
[553.56] Then why are reacting like girls?
[556.52] No, I'm not giving any
reaction of this sort.
[560.23] Anyways, be easy. She is just helping us.
[563.39] Yeah, okay.
[568.90] -Won't you offer me some tea?
-Yeah I'll get some tea for you.
[582.81] It's great that you came, Almas.
[584.75] The food is being served,
then we'll have lunch together.
[586.70] I had to come.
[588.72] You should keep visiting,
it's your daughter's own house.
[592.36] Don't know how long it's going to be?
[594.68] Why are you saying that? With God's
will it's going to be always like that.
[598.26] If your son wants only then
this home can remain hers.
[601.62] And if this relationship sustains
only then this home can remain hers.
[604.87] What are you trying to
say, Almas, I don't get you.
[608.97] Anyway, you aren't that naive.
[612.14] Look, whatever you want to say, if
you'll say it clearly it would be better.
[617.56] Your son is having an affair with 
a girl and you aren't even aware of that?
[623.14] Nosheen must have told you that.
[625.71] Obviously, she is my daughter
and she is going to tell that to me.
[628.43] Almas, it can be her whim too.
[632.02] A woman's sixth sense is
very correct in this regard.
[635.33] She can never be wrong.
[638.43] But I have talked to Faiq about it already.
[641.48] And according to him,
whatever Nosheen is thinking
[644.06] is just a misunderstanding, nothing else.
[646.96] People usually lie in such matters,
and I'm sure, Faiq is lying to you.
[653.48] Look, Almas. We have got just two options.
[657.27] One is that we believe
what Faiq said and
[660.28] take this relationship
forward in a good way.
[665.22] And the other is that we
consider what Faiq told a lie
[668.29] and ruin their relationship
with our own hand.
[672.31] Now it depends on you. 
Tell me what do you want to do?
[676.54] I am here just to tell you
that make Faiq understand
[680.19] that my daughter isn't alone.
[684.65] He knows it very well.
[688.20] If her father and brother
didn't join the wedding
[691.54] that doesn't mean that
they are going to watch
[694.17] any injustice being
done to her and tolerate.
[696.94] Just make it clear to Faiq.
[700.03] I just don't understand why are you
thinking so wrong and so far ahead?
[705.01] If you had a daughter you
would have understood this pain.
[709.59] I have always considered
Nosheen as my daughter.
[713.75] All these things are just verbal.
[718.41] When it's time everyone
takes their son's side.
[721.45] You are right, Almas, 
maybe that is how it happens.
[726.79] Because when Faiq left Aima and
said that he wants to marry Nosheen
[730.95] then I didn't force him at all.
[735.61] Look, I didn't mention it to embarrass you.
[738.73] I just want to tell you that children
get emotional and they make mistakes.
[746.02] But it's the job of us elders to use
our sense. and advise them.
[750.74] I am here just to tell you to tell Faiq
[753.87] that if he does anything
stupid to my daughter
[757.31] then I am going to take her away from here.
[764.70] I won't leave her to anyone's mercy. 
Just keep that in mind.
[770.42] Almas, always remember one thing.
[773.89] The responsibility to save
the marriages of children
[776.14] is more on their elders
than on themselves.
[781.19] Because they are taking wrong
decisions while being emotional.
[784.54] And it's the duty of us elders to
use our sense and have patience.
[788.54] And tell them the difference
between right and wrong.
[793.26] And I expect the same from you too
[796.98] that you will be patient
and use your sense.
[801.20] You are right. Nimra but I'm
a daughter’s mother, how can I be patient?
[805.75] Just don't worry.
[809.13] This time I will try that nothing
wrong happens to anyone.
[824.04] Whoever it is come in, will I
get up now to open the door?
[831.11] Mama, you, here at this hour?
[834.90] Yes, it's my daughter's
home can't I visit her?
[838.41] I thought of coming and surprising you.
[841.22] You can visit, but you know
[843.46] that you have already made a
blunder because of this surprise.
[847.24] Oh, Nosheen, forget old things.
[851.73] Why do you have
something new to tell?
[854.89] Yes, I have such a news that
your hear will get crazy with joy.
[859.76] Why? Has Zaid decided
to divorce Zoya and Aima?
[864.18] Oh, what are you saying?
[865.98] God forbid that he divorces Zoya.
[867.81] Zoya is expecting his child.
[874.11] -Really?
-You are going to be an aunt.
[878.89] I will become an aunt. But the cleverness
that your sister and niece have done...
[884.29] What do you mean by cleverness?
[886.59] Well the elders say that when
there comes a child in the house,
[890.86] the woman gets stronger in the house.
[896.69] Your niece has tried the same trick.
[900.65] And now you'll see
what she is going to do.
[906.37] What nonsense do you keep talking.
[912.29] I am telling you mama, she is
going to throw so much tantrums,
[913.56] and your whole house is going to bear them.
[917.18] Now Zoya isn't going
anywhere after leaving brother.
[920.51] God forbid that she leaves Zaid.
[925.35] It's Aima who is going to be removed now.
[927.51] And then we will have
some peace in our lives.
[930.70] Where else would she go? 
She will remain there.
[933.58] I think she will only leave
this house when she dies.
[936.08] Forget that and just
celebrate this thing right now.
[939.97] -You just wait now.
-What for?
[943.32] Well, this, that how Zoya is
going to control brother now.
[948.36] And she is going to make the
whole house dance on her tunes.
[950.76] Nosheen, why are you
thinking so negatively?
[954.03] Okay fine. You'll see,
me and you are here to watch.
[957.93] Forget it, eat this cake.
[960.20] Come on, mama, since you are
here you are talking about yourself only.
[963.74] At least ask something about me.
[965.77] What's wrong with you? You seem fine.
[968.74] I always seem fine apparently. 
But I'm not feeling well.
[973.07] -Nosheen, what's wrong with you?
-I think it's food poisoning.
[977.40] -Come, let me take you to the doctor.
-Mama, come on, relax.
[981.18] I have been to the doctor with
auntie, I had my test done as well.
[985.54] Nobody takes care of
my daughter in this house.
[988.53] What's all right? Faiq as
called that girl over dinner today.
[993.66] What? Nosheen, what are you saying?
[996.36] Your mother in law made so many
claims in front of me the other day.
[999.58] -When did you talk to her?
-Leave that.
[1002.26] -At least tell me.
-I came here the other day,
[1005.51] I told her that she shouldn't think
that my daughter has no backing.
[1010.02] Okay.
[1011.67] Yeah, if someone cause
trouble for my daughter
[1014.03] and thinks that I am
not going to do anything,
[1016.89] I am going to skin him alive.
[1018.93] Anyways, don't get so worried.
You daughter isn't so simple
[1023.40] that she is going to
tolerate every cruelty.
[1025.04] I know how to correct people.
[1027.38] For God's sake Nosheen, will
you say something nice for once?
[1032.75] Okay fine.
[1035.80] You go home and celebrate
your son's happiness.
[1039.55] I just want to rest.
[1041.63] Okay, take rest. I'll leave.
[1072.60] You did very right. Now you will be
get off all the burden off your chest.
[1076.81] Yeah, you are right.
[1078.75] When there is burden on a person’s
chest, he doesn't like anything.
[1083.60] And it was the same with me.
[1086.02] I was tired of telling lies.
[1089.07] And when you are guilty from
inside, then you start blaming others.
[1096.73] You are right.
[1098.27] You know, by taking away others' happiness,
[1101.06] by hurting them you can
never stay happy as well.
[1104.38] Why are you being so sad?
[1106.72] You have understood
everything now, so make it right.
[1109.41] Yes, you are right, I am
feeling much better now.
[1114.19] I hope I will be able to
keep Nosheen happy now.
[1116.26] That's more like it.
[1117.40] By the way, Salman, there's one thing,
[1119.53] people are right, life isn't easy.
[1122.30] Stop it, man. You have been
talking philosophy since so long.
[1127.51] Life isn't that difficult.
[1129.54] We are much better than many
others. You should be thankful.
[1134.20] -You are right.
-Then just chill out.
[1137.22] Besides it's the inauguration
of your restaurant today.
[1139.92] Yes, I wanted to talk to you about it.
[1143.61] What is it?
[1145.25] I was thinking of bringing
mother and Nosheen along tonight.
[1150.40] That's a very good idea.
[1152.35] Yeah, I just have to
plan everything with you.
[1155.19] Sure, everything will be planned.
[1157.98] Tell me, have you invited Sania?
[1160.70] No, I haven't invited Sania.
[1163.86] If you say I can send an
official invitation to her.
[1169.39] After all she has done the
interior of the whole restaurant.
[1173.11] Yes, you are right.
[1175.16] but may be Nosheen won't like it.
[1179.65] And, Salman, I don't want
anything of he sort
[1182.62] because of which distances are
created between me and Nosheen.
[1185.98] Yeah, that's right too.
[1188.51] And you know, I'm very
satisfied with one thing.
[1192.61] Which is that mother and
Nosheen are getting along well.
[1198.04] And this thing has completely
cleared my heart from Nosheen's side.
[1202.80] That's really nice. By the
way Sania is actually a nice girl.
[1207.37] That's true.
[1209.16] As much interaction I had with her, I have
found her as a girl of very strong character.
[1213.98] You know, Sania is getting married.
[1216.84] -Really? With whom?
-With a guy, who else?
[1220.13] I was asking just like that.
[1223.11] -That's nice, she is getting married too.
-Were you planning to propose her?
[1227.54] Not a bad idea. Had you told me a little
earlier I could have thought about it.
[1231.52] Fine, maybe she wasn't in your fate.
[1234.20] Of course. But who can go against
fate? May be someone else then.
[1238.52] -Thank you, Salman?
-What for?
[1241.32] For always being there.
[1243.30] Why do you get emotional like girls?
[1246.50] Anyway, tell me, what
are your plans for tonight?
[1249.56] You'll tell me, it's our
company's inauguration today.
[1266.80] You must have heard. 
Me and Zoya are moving out.
[1271.20] Yeah, dd told me.
[1277.97] It's a very huge step for me, Aima.
[1283.55] I have reached this conclusion
after giving it a lot of thought.
[1287.53] The only reason I wanted to
do it was that I wanted peace.
[1292.64] I am fed up.
[1296.97] But please, don't you ever
think that I am leaving you.
[1302.16] Why would I think that? Besides, 
it's your right.
[1308.29] No Aima, neither I am leaving
you nor I'm leaving mom and dad.
[1315.00] I'm just leaving this house.
[1321.25] That too because I need some peace.
[1325.84] I'm sick of these everyday fights.
[1328.38] I'll pray for you that may this
decision be beneficial for you.
[1333.83] Thank you. May be this way we
all might get closer to each other.
[1338.93] There are no more complains and grudges.
[1341.11] Yes, it is possible.
[1345.30] Listen,
[1347.72] did dad say anything to you?
[1350.26] Regarding what?
[1351.91] Means, is he sad because of my decision?
[1356.18] May be he is. But he
has no objection on you.
[1361.26] He isn't unhappy with you.
[1368.99] Aima, tell me honestly,
[1375.36] do you think I'm taking the right decision
by taking Zoya and moving out like this.
[1382.13] How can I tell you that?
[1385.37] This is your life, Zaid.
[1387.44] And nobody else would know any
better if your decision is right nor not.
[1393.18] and if your heart is satisfied then
you don't need anybody else's advise.
[1400.02] Besides, Zaid, you have
followed other's advise a lot.
[1406.71] And I have just one suggestion for you now.
[1409.80] That do whatever you feel happy about.
[1414.83] -Are you happy?
-Me?
[1419.20] Where did my happiness come in this?
[1423.00] What do you mean, Aima?
You are very important in my life.
[1431.43] Your happiness and your
decision means a lot to me.
[1435.03] -Is it so?
-Yes.
[1437.62] If that's the case then my
happiness lies within your happiness.
[1443.79] I'm sure whatever you must have
thought, it must be beneficial for us all.
[1449.79] I trust you completely.
[1452.33] You can never go wrong.
[1454.98] Even I don't trust myself this
much as much you trust me.
[1460.54] I really like it, I feel so much peace
when you say all these things.
[1466.72] It feels like there is someone who
understands my sorrow, my pain.
[1474.23] Thank you for always
being there for me, Aima.
[1506.11] Zaid, come dear.
[1513.86] What's wrong dad, is everything okay?
[1517.28] Noting I was just
feeling a little tightness.
[1518.86] Did you lift something heavy?
[1521.50] No, I don't remember that
I had lifted any thing heavy.
[1526.06] -Dad, please take care.
-Yeah, I will, from now on.
[1532.56] Anyway, I called you to ask
you what you have decided?
[1536.34] Did you look for a house?
[1537.86] Yes, we have visited a couple of
houses and Zoya and me like it.
[1542.47] For how much are you getting it?
[1544.94] For now I am thinking of renting a place.
[1546.92] And if I feel like buying one in
the future I'll get a loan from office.
[1550.46] What are you talking about?
[1553.96] Loan's option is for employs, 
it's your own company.
[1557.56] I'd say, why are you going on rent?
[1559.55] If you like he house
then buy it straight away.
[1561.92] -Dad, are you sure?
-Of course I am?
[1565.53] Whatever I could do to
support you I'd do for sure.
[1568.58] thank you, Dad, it really means a lot.
[1571.15] Tell me, you will be
coming to office, right?
[1574.38] What are you talking about? I
am not going away from you.
[1576.65] It's just temporary
because I need a break.
[1581.35] Besides, how much do we meet in
this house. You are so busy, me also...
[1586.93] Anyway, I hope that we will
going to spend quality time together.
[1593.31] And you know it, dad. If I didn't had
to, I would have never left this house.
[1597.52] I can understand. You just be easy.
[1605.74] Oops!
[1607.08] Dad, are you sure you're
okay, should I call the doctor...
[1609.84] No, no, everything is fine. 
I was just feeling a little restless.
[1613.78] It will be all right.
[1635.66] What do you think, Zoya?
[1638.26] Is there actually a problem
or is this all a pretense?
[1642.23] Mom, why would he pretend?
[1646.60] You don't know Azmat Hussain.
[1649.12] He is a very cunning and stubborn person.
[1651.77] He can do anything to get what he wants.
[1655.26] To get his son's sympathies he can
even pretend to have a heart attack
[1660.90] -so that his son melts down.
-Really?
[1664.80] I feel that he has done all this
to stop Zaid from moving out.
[1671.71] In fact, he gave him permission
to move out from here.
[1677.84] So, mom, won't I and Zaid shift from here?
[1681.79] Of course you will.
[1683.79] No one can stop you from moving
out, no matter they if they do any effort.
[1690.28] -But for that you'll have to do one thing.
-What mom?
[1694.27] Just take Zaid in confidence.
[1697.56] -Increase your importance for him.
-Mom, I'm already very important for him.
[1704.81] Zoya, make your behaviour so nice that
Zaid never even thinks about hurting you.
[1714.46] This is your chance to prove yourself.
[1721.09] Help him in his problems.
[1723.45] Consider his tension as your
own, but  with that
[1727.54] convince him to move out from here too.
[1733.90] -Not by using force, politely.
-Yes, you're right.
[1738.21] Remember one thing.
Zaid listens to his dad a lot.
[1743.24] That's why take care
of him, like Aima does.
[1748.04] I will try, I don't know but I'll try.
[1776.85] Aima,
[1779.72] Aima!
[1781.42] Hope for the best.
[1784.10] Zaid, I'm really scared.
[1788.23] Look, when auntie had a heart attack,
you didn't lose courage even then.
[1792.46] You have to be brave
right now, God is merciful.
[1797.02] Nothing is going to happen to dad.
[1800.47] Tell me, do you want something?
[1825.79] Come on, don't cry like that.
[1828.86] Just pray, brother Azmat
will get better and come home.
[1832.80] That's true Amber, but for the past
few months, our lives have been cursed.
[1839.05] and now I'm losing hope now.
[1843.76] -When did this happen?
-Around the time of morning prayers.
[1847.08] I woke up when I heard something fell down
[1850.09] so he wasn't on the bed.
[1855.81] When I went in the lounge 
and looked for him
[1858.26] then he was holding his
chest and had fallen down.
[1869.16] Thank God that I woke
up on time, otherwise
[1873.38] I don't know what would have happened?
[1876.95] Then you should have
been with him at the hospital.
[1880.99] Amber, there are not much
people allowed in the hospital
[1883.43] and besides Zaid and Aima
are there, I am not needed there.
[1887.51] What are you talking about? 
You are his wife.
[1892.32] Had you been near him, he would
have felt content by seeing you.
[1897.42] And, by the way, where is
your sister in law, Shabana?
[1902.10] She is praying for her brother.
[1904.59] By the way, Zaid being there is
understandable because he is his son,
[1910.13] but what is Aima doing there?
[1912.62] Amber, right now I only
care about my husband.
[1914.81] Just pray that he
gets back home safely.
[1918.73] I'm sure, you'll see he will be back.
[1933.03] Yes, what is it?
[1934.93] Faiq, how is Mr. Azmat doing?
[1938.40] I don't know, mother.
[1939.64] Faiq, why don't you know?
[1944.73] Didn't you call Nosheen or Zaid?
[1947.60] We are facing calamities only.
[1950.37] That's nothing new.
[1951.97] When you will hear, you will be
surprised too, your head will spin.
[1956.55] I feel that our home is
getting scattered gradually.
[1959.95] Enough, mama, I have nothing
to do with this home of yours.
[1963.31] Here my life is getting scattered and
you want me to listen to your cries?
[1967.19] Hello.
[1971.09] Hello, who is this?
[1973.51] Hello, who are you?
[1975.94] You called, who do you want to talk to?
