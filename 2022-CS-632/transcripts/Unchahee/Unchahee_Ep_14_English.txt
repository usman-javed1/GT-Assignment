From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you -What is wrong with mother?
-She has had a major heart attack. We will have to do her angiography, so that
we can know how many arteries are blocked. Major heart attack? -He likes a girl called Kinza.
-Really? My would-be sister-in-law's name is Kinza? Doctor has told Shabana not to talk much. May be that's why Aima said this to you. I didn't go to chat either,
it was all the usual. What happened, when it happened
and how it happened, that's it. Kids want to do everything
according to their own wish. They want to make the decisions about
their own lives with full right as well. That's how it is, Dad. Around 100,000/- A hundred thousand? Are you insane, Faisal?
I gave you a fifty thousand few days a go. If it was about 10,000-15,000,
I could have thought of something. I have to clear someone's dues. Who is it and what dues? I  don't know what do you
keep yourself involved into, Faisal. Just tell me if you can arrange
a hundred thousand or not? No. I can't believe this. Are you going to do this with me too? Faisal because of your payments,
my account is already empty. And even last time I had transferred
money to you from Mama's account. Come, on. 100,000/- isn't
a big amount. Besides, look at your dad's business. It might not be a big thing to arrange
a 100,000/- for my dad, for me it is. And why don't you ask you papa? -He has got a lot of money too.
-I haven't asked for options from you. You know it well that me and
my dad don't get along well, and still you say
the same thing every time. Anyway, I think I'll have
to take a loan from the bank. Okay, wait. I'll think of something. I'm going to get caught because of you. Until I'm here, I won't let you
happen anything. Trust me. Tell me one thing, Faisal,
did you pay that guy? -Which guy?
-Faisal, your memory is effected too much. The guy who trapped Aima. Yes, yes. I cleared his payment. And Aima has shown you her real face. She has shown you that we both
are such girls that you don't like. -What do you want?
-Justice. Equality, Dad. You are a man of your words. Then you can't get
a better chance than this, Dad. Dad, Dad I have to talk to you
about something very important. Regarding you marriage? No, Dad, I... I just want to tell you the whole truth. I can't see you angry. I'm not angry with you anymore, Aima. I'm just angry at myself to expect
more than required from you. Dad... Dad, I've... I've always tried
to meet your expectations. I used to think that way too,
a few days ago. But I guess it was a misunderstanding. It's not like that, Dad. I have left your decisions on you. Do whatever you think is better for you. Dad, your experience and principles are respectable for me. I'm satisfied with your decisions too. It sounds really good to listen to it. But this creates a difference
between your word and deed. What deed? The deed which I haven't done? What are you trying to say? That I... I don't love any guy. I didn't even know that guy. Then what was all that, Aima,
that I saw with my own eyes. I don't know, Dad. I have been deceived. Whatever I have done, I did it
because I was compelled to do it. What was the compulsion? That you had to visit
that guy's house to meet him? Tell me? A guy was calling
and messaging me since many days. He was blackmailing me. He sent me some
inappropriate pictures of mine. Looking at which, I got worried. I just went to his flat to get that... You went to that guy's house alone,
to get your pictures? And you didn't even think
that you are doing such a huge mistake? Dad, I got really scared, that's why... Did you talk to Zaid about it? No, Dad. Zaid was unaware of all this. You both have such a strong friendship,
you guys are such good friends, why did you hide it from him then? Go, Aima, just go. I am not going to change
the decision that I have made. Please, Dad. I didn't even know that guy. You can ask Zoya. She is the witness of all this,
she knows everything. I have listened to your witness.
That is enough for me. But unfortunately it's no use
talking about all this. Had you shared it with Zaid,
if you had told him that, then my reaction wouldn't
have been so intense. I should have told Zaid, Dad. At times, you have to bear
the consequences of your mistakes, Aima. Now go from here. Dad... I have made a huge mistake. Please forgive me. Lies, truth, mistakes, what difference does it make? Whatever happened,
we can change that, Aima. I have made some decisions
out of compulsion too. Now go. I can't believe, dad is still not ready
to believe what Aima is saying. Moreover, he refused
to listen to your witness even. Zaid, you did the right thing to stop me. Had uncle said all that in front of me,
I would have felt really bad. I just don't get it why is Dad
considering Aima as a liar? Specially when you are ready
to witness in her favor. The reason is very simple.
Uncle doesn't like me. So... I have always noticed that. Why wouldn't dad like you? I have always felt that way.
And everyone has their own choice. Look, you might be mistaken. I'm not mistaken. I mean,
I have seen him avoiding me. But, anyway,
it's about Aima right now not me, so... I'm just worried, till when
is she going to stay at home, and what is going to happen to her studies? Not for much long.
We'll find a solution soon if God wills. I hope so. Kinza, can't you understand that if a
person isn't replying then he must be busy. Just listen, stop calling
and messaging me right now, I am really worried,
I can't talk right now. All good? Any tension? I don't know,
I just can't see Aima like that. I mean, Zaid, I am worried about her too,
but taking stress is no solution, is it? You're right Zoya, but this is a serious matter for God's sake.
This is about her honor. I just want this issue
to be resolved as soon as possible, and the truth to be revealed. I want that too, but for that we need to keep our
minds cool, so that we can find a solution. So, calm down. Your brother, he is such a weird guy. Why, what happened? I don't know, when I asked him,
he got a call and then he was saying send me the location, tell me the address. And then he barged outside. Why did I become unwanted No one knows that Why did I become unwanted No one knows that Mother. Dear, what have you made? I have made chicken broth for you. What are you doing? Seems like you are
going to get me fat by feeding me so much. That's what I intend to do. Okay, tell me, did you eat anything? No, I'll have dinner when it's served
on the dining table, with everyone else. Why have you made a long face?
Did anything happen? No, Mother, nothing happened. Dear, there comes
a point in a person's life that the person gets helpless. He gets trapped at a dead end. Then he realizes that he has
nothing in his hands. When such a situation comes,
losing hope is not the way out. What shall one do in such a situation? The human is mistaken
to think that he is in control. But it's not like that at all. The only one in control
and the complete one is God only. And whatever God does, He does what's the best for us. Dear, until God makes a decision a person should remain patient
and stand firm. Expect the best from God. He is the real truth. He never lets anyone face injustice. That's the only hope left for me, Mother. Just pray for me. You fool, do you have to ask for that? Dear, if I won't pray for you
who else am I going to pray for then? And a mother's prayer reaches the sky. Okay, Mother, have your broth now
or it will get cold. Okay, sure. But first, I am going to make
my daughter have it first. All right? You don't eat anything yourself,
and you keep asking me, huh? -Come on, now you have it.
-Okay, okay. Okay, I'll have it. Who is it? Who are you? What do you want? Patience. I'll tell you everything
and find out everything too. Look, go away from here or else... You are so tiny,
I am going to bury you alive. Brother, what do you want? Look, the one you are looking for,
I am not that. Answer my questions right away
or else it can fire too. What questions? -How do you know Aima?
-Aima, who? ??????? -Stop lying!
-I don't know any such girl. Why are you blackmailing her? Don't kill me, don't kill me. Seems like you aren't
going to listen the easy way. I'll tell you, I'll tell you,
don't kill me. I didn't do it myself. -Somebody asked me to do it.
-Stop lying! I'm telling you seriously, -someone paid me to do this task.
-Who, who paid you? There is this guy, Faisal.
He is a very cheap man. -Faisal who?
-There is this guy. And his girlfriend asked him
to do all this. -Tell me the name of his girlfriend!
-Name... name. Narmeen, Natasha, it was something
like that which I heard from Faisal. Tell me properly or I'll shoot you. Don't kill me, I'm telling.
Let me remember. Narmeen, Natasha... what was it? Noreen...
No, no, Nosheen. Yes, her name was Nosheen. I remember, her name is Nosheen. -Are you lying?
-No, her name was 100% Nosheen. If you have got what you want,
then leave. Move it or it might fire. -Just half of my work is done. Get up.
-Half of the work? -Get up.
-What else is left? Mama, didn't you go? You were
going to the boutique, didn't you? -Yes I was.
-Then? Your brother, he is such a weird boy. Why? What happened? I don't know, when I asked him
he got a call and he was saying Send me the location, tell me the address. And then he barged out. I don't know what is this guy up to. So, didn't he tell you anything? That's what I'm angry about. If the driver was home,
I wouldn't have cared. Anyway, tell me, is Faisal's family coming? Yes, he'll send them in a few days. Listen, Nosheen, does he even intend
to do so, or is he just passing time? He should have sent his family right away. Mama, why do you keep talking
against Faisal all the time? I trust him. Dear, trusting someone isn't enough,
specially when it's about a girl like you. What do you mean? Look, think over it, because whatever you'll say,
your dad is going to agree to it. Then this is a good thing, Mama. Nosheen, I just feel that you are
taking your marriage very lightly. Look, there are a hundred things,
financial position, family. One has to keep all these things in mind. Don't worry, the family is nice. Have you met his family, Nosheen? No, but I have an idea
after knowing Faisal. -His father is quite rich, but...
-But? He doesn't get along too well with his dad. So what if they don't get along well,
after all he is his son. He will eventually inherit the property. Nosheen, not everyone can provide you
a luxurious life like your dad. If you call living like this as luxurious,
then I don't want to live such a life. Go ahead, be as thankless as you can. You will realize the value
of all this after you'll get married. Yeah, right. Don't know when this girl
is going to be sensible. He's not answering the phone.
Why don't you do one thing, it's too late, you should go home. I am going to call uncle.
I'll tell him everything. Don't worry, I've got
a lot of time. Just call! Okay, brother, why are you shouting?
I'm calling him. Listen, the guy from whom
we got the task done, is he an okay guy? Yes, of course. Why, what happened?
Did he say anything. No, nothing. I was just asking. Did you call to ask just that? No, I called to ask
if you have talked to your family. Nosheen, I've told you, I'll do it. Faisal, you keep avoiding it, and here
mama is on my nerves asking about it. Tell me the exact date,
when are you going to bring them? Look, Nosheen, it's not just you
who is in a hurry, I am in a hurry too. What's the problem then? I have talked to my mother, but papa... What's his problem? It's not an easy task to convince him. And only mother can do it.
That's why it's taking so long. Why can't you convince him? -Don't you know why?
-When needed, one has to make the donkey... I'm sorry. I mean he is your real father. Talk to him, explain him
and bring the proposal to my home. Sir, I have to tell you a truth. I have made a huge mistake
because of greed. Please attend my call. Yes, uncle. Actually Aima is innocent. I had blackmailed her. Someone paid me to do so. Yes, I edited her pictures. So that
 I can blackmail her and call her to meet her. Why did I become unwanted No one knows that Why did I become unwanted No one knows that Listen, did you arrange the money
 that I asked you to arrange? No, it's difficult to arrange
so much money at once. Nosheen, please do something. I actually need them
or else I wouldn't have asked you. -Take it from your mother.
-Right, I should take it from my mother? -And who is going to give her the money?
-Tell her to take it from your dad. If it was that easy,
I wouldn't have asked you. Anyway, forget it. I don't get it, why do you
need them so much? Have you gotten
into some fraud or anything? -Nosheen, you are doubting me now?
-No I'm just... Listen to me, if you
can give then it's fine. Or else I'll arrange it
from somewhere else. Okay, listen. I'll try to get it
from mama's account. -Okay, fine.
-Okay, bye. Say whatever you have to say. Uncle, I wanted to talk
to you about something. About Aima. Yes uncle. Uncle, Aima is innocent. I had blackmailed her. Some one paid me to do it. Yes, I edited her pictures. So that I can blackmail her
and call her to meet me. And when she came, I got the pictures
taken secretly and then sent them to you. Yes, uncle, she is innocent. Forgive me, uncle, I won't do it again. -Who asked you to do all this?
-Who asked me? Uncle, Nosheen and her boyfriend Faisal. Yes... hello? Hello? Uncle isn't saying anything. He must have no answer. Are you happy now, brother? I have done what you asked me to. You should be happy,
because the thing you have done, I would have smashed you into mince. -I'm just being kind to you.
-Thank you, brother. Thank you. Where did your equality go
 in this matter, Dad? You humiliated me and mama so much. The whole house was echoing of your
voice when you were humiliating us. And today? Today your silence
 is saying something else, Dad. I feel like we should renovate
the drawing room. Just to change the look a little. And we'll get it done soon, before Faisal brings
the proposal for Nosheen. Are you even listening
to me since all this time, or not? You are going to listen to me now. Everything all right? Make preparations. Nosheen
is going to get married this week. What's the rush? You weren't
even ready to listen to Faisal's name. And now getting her married so soon?
Meet his family first. You have mentioned that guy's name
for the last time in this house. Got it? -Nosheen is not going to marry that guy.
-Then? -I don't know that.
-What do you mean, what are you saying? I haven't thought who your
daughter is going to get married to, but she will get married
this week that's decided. What are you saying, without
seeing the guy, how can she marry? Whoever is ready
to marry her within a week and take her away, I will
get her married to him. That's my final decision. I don't care who he is, how he is. Nosheen, pick up the phone. Come home as soon as you can. You can say that. It's like a catastrophe. Yes, come home any way you can. I'll tell you. Yes. Both father and daughter, can't let me
stay at peace even for a single moment. Mother... Here , have some. Careful. Get up and have some water. Oh, Aima, lie down. You have been taking care
of me since last night, you must be tired. No, Mother. I was just talking to God. That's why I won't get tired. Besides, I'm at peace now. My heart has found peace. I have left everything to God. That's it. You don't need to worry now. He is our Benefactor. 
He'll do what's better for you. Mother, you go to sleep now. 
I will recite the Qur’an now. Okay fine. But I've been trying hard 
to get some sleep, but I can't sleep. Shall I massage you? No, dear. Dad, you, at this hour?
Everything all right? -Please come, sit.
-Sit down, sit down. Brother, is everything all right? 
You're here at this hour? I have come to apologize from you both. To tell you the truth, my 
mind wasn't ready to accept it, that Aima could do such a thing. But I don't know I don't know how I doubted her. I will never forgive my self for that. What are you talking about, Dad. Whatever you did, you did it unknowingly. No, I have done it in being 
fully aware and alert. I have done it using all my senses. Brother, just forget it as a mistake,
and we'll forget it too. No, Shabana, not so easily. Your hearts may be so vast for me but for me it isn't so. And the real agony is that I trusted 
some random person. I believed on his false evidence, but I didn't bother to listen
to what my child had to say. How can this be just a mistake? You to have full right to complain to me. No, Dad. I have no complains from you. Brother, even if you were angry
with us, you didn't stop caring for us. You didn't taunt us. You took care of all our needs
and didn't let us short of anything. Then tell me, brother, how can
we complain you about anything? Yes, Dad, Mother is right. No that is you tolerance, because I have hurt you both a lot. I have pointed fingers 
at your upbringing, Shabana. I doubted my child, 
with such a good character. Aima had to face so much loss 
regarding her studies, and the reason of your heart attack
was this negligence of mine too. I... -Oh, my God!
-I apologize from you two. -I have hurt you both a lot.
-Dad, please... please don't embarrass us. -Please.
-No, my child, I want to repent. There is a fire inside me, I am in pain since I have
come to know that I was at fault. Dad, we, we... we don't want anything. Just give me back the place 
in your heart that I had lost. I don't want anything else. Look, brother, if you want to do
anything for us then forgive yourself. I would never want 
to see you embarrassed like this. I don't like seeing you this way at all. -Dad.
-Brother. -Mother.
-Brother. -Please forgive me.
-Please, Dad. -Forget it.
-Please, enough now, Dad. Why have I become unwanted Nobody knows that. Why have I become unwanted? Nobody knows that. At least tell me who is the guy? How is the family? Enough, Dad. Enough of your drama. What do you think? I'll marry and
that too with a boy of your choice? Stop this nonsense! I can't believe my eyes, what I've just seen. I just don't understand what had gotten
into brother, he never does like that. Mother, Nosheen must have done 
something wrong.
