[0.14] From flowers and from buds
[4.69] I have learnt to bloom and be fragrant
[9.05] When I saw you
[14.24] I learned how to chirp from you
[19.30] Well then to prove your friendship, 
give me a favor.
[23.41] What kind of favor?
[24.93] I am going to leave for the
farm house in a little while.
[27.91] Just stay for a little longer.
[29.16] Faisal, don't be silly. Dad, often wakes
up for early morning prayers, just go now.
[35.48] If you could just stay for a little longer.
[43.79] Mind you language, she is my mother.
[46.63] Really? The thief scolding the police?
[51.83] I am well aware of the plan you and
your mother had made to get me caught.
[58.60] Look, you are misunderstanding me.
[61.24] And secondly, my mother is your aunt.
You have got a blood relation with her.
[67.48] To hell with such blood 
and such a relation.
[74.13] I can trust any random person walking
on the street, but not you both.
[80.65] Thankless people.
Biting the hands that feed you.
[85.83] Enough, Nosheen. Get out from here.
[89.44] You are the one 
who is going to get out from here.
[93.56]  I won't go anywhere, this is my house.
[97.11] Until I am under the shelter of dad, 
this is my house too.
[103.09] Fine, stay here, 
until I am going to let you stay here.
[110.14] You have made a huge mistake
 by messing with me.
[113.23] You are the one who has
committed the mistake.
[115.02] Instead of accepting your mistake
 you are blaming us?
[118.94] Don't you ever judge me.
[121.27] You have humiliated me
in front of my father,
[123.99] I am going to humiliate you
in front of the whole world.
[126.81] Remember that, it's a promise.
[138.35] Whatever has happened
in this house yesterday
[140.02]  isn't worth it to get discussed
again in front of anyone.
[146.03] That's why I have made some decisions.
[148.38] And that's why I have called both of you.
[151.60] Why don't you eat something, you
haven't eaten anything since morning.
[154.55] -You don't need to worry about me.
-Azmat you...
[159.26] I went to get her admission
canceled from her college.
[161.46]  She won't be going from tomorrow.
[163.48] -Yes but...
-Don't interrupt me.
[167.43] She is not going to use any phone.
[169.94] Dad, Dad just listen to me.
[172.97] She is not allowed to go anywhere.
[176.62] Neither anyone is going to come here,
nor she is going to go anywhere.
[178.75] Meeting friends all these excuses
and pretense must end now.
[181.68] If there is something really
important
[183.77] then the person should meet her here
at home in presence of everyone.
[188.70] If you both have any questions you can ask.
[191.82]  Look I admit that she is at fault, but...
[195.40] No ifs and but.
[198.06] If she has committed a mistake
 she must be punished for it.
[201.35] Dad, Dad I'm sorry,
 please just give me a last chance...
[204.85] I have given you that chance last time.
[212.36] You have lost all your
chances to get excused
[214.45] don't expect any
relaxation from me now.
[217.84] Dad, without a phone,
without going to college,
[221.27] how am I supposed to spend
my time staying at home?
[224.36] Don't worry, you won't be spending 
much time in this house.
[229.89] Meaning?
[230.64] I mean that she should be get
married as soon as possible.
[235.05] But I don't want to get
married right now, Dad.
[237.25] I haven't asked for your opinion,
 I have told you my decision.
[244.78] You can't do it, Dad.
[247.42] Marrying someone with my own will is my
right and it's your responsibility...
[252.95] I just stopped myself before hitting you
today, don't you dare say that again.
[258.44] Or else I won't stop then, understood?
[293.38] What are you doing, Mother? 
I told you to rest.
[297.86] Brother is here, I thought
of making tea for him.
[301.17] You should have told me, Mother, 
I could have made it.
[303.60] Oh, it's all right.
[308.71] You both must be relieved 
after seeing my daughter like this.
[316.88] I don't want to talk to
you on this issue at all.
[319.28] Of course you won't want to talk about it,
because your planning has been so perfect.
[325.48] There was no planning.
[327.44] Really? How was your timing so perfect?
Could you please tell me?
[332.12] You won't believe me 
no matter what I tell you.
[336.81] Those who are guilty 
at heart always say that.
[340.68] Auntie, please stop now, 
you know mother is not well.
[344.29] Does she gets worse by listening the truth?
[349.12] What do you want, auntie, 
why are you behaving like this with us?
[353.17] Do you want to know what I want?
[355.29] I want peace in this house 
which I can't get while you both are here.
[361.58] So, tell me, can you do that?
[364.08] It just saddens me.
[366.07] Had we obliged some
stranger so much,
[368.36] he would have been thankful
to us all his life.
[370.92] And then there are you two, always
keep planning against my daughter,
[374.98] -keep conspiring against her.
-Sister...
[380.55] You are accusing us.
[383.81] I would never want 
anything bad for Nosheen.
[387.20] And whatever she does, 
she would remain my niece.
[393.23] You are a liar. You are jealous.
[395.44] You weren't able to give Aima 
what I have given to Nosheen.
[398.82] I decided the day I
showed you the diamond set
[402.35] that you are going to harm Nosheen.
[404.94] Auntie, please, stop it now,
 or else I am going to involve dad.
[408.98] Don't you dare threaten me. I am not
afraid of anyone in this house, got it?
[416.01] You've taken away 
the happiness of other's daughters.
[418.71] Despite of having a young
daughter yourself.
[421.08] Now go and show your crocodile
tears to your brother.
[426.87] Let's go from here, mother. Let's go.
[439.04] Have some water please, Mother.
[443.38] Please stop crying.
[451.56] Mother, don't take the bitter things 
that auntie says seriously.
[456.71] For that I will have to get
really, really insensitive.
[463.65] Look, you know 
how she is since the beginning.
[468.44] She is just like that.
[470.44] Whatever good we do to her, 
she is never going to get happy.
[478.44] You are right.
[481.25] She is one of those,
[483.44] who never get happy, 
no matter what you do for them.
[488.92] Mother, if you now that then...
[492.32] why do you cry?
[497.11] I listen to everything she says.
[501.61] Stay quiet.
[505.86] I tolerate it.
[509.13] I have never argued with her.
[517.41] But don't know why,
[522.70] I get really sad at times.
[525.62] I can't stop my tears even if I want.
[532.46] One should cry sometimes to feel relieved.
[543.42] But now, I think,
[549.44] whatever is happening with me,
[554.07] don't know if it's God's test or curse?
[561.76] Yes, Mother, it's a test.
[567.46] Just like father's death was a test for us.
[575.27] Yes I comfort myself just by thinking that,
[580.88] that behind everything God does,
[585.74] there is some expedience.
[590.51] -Like?
-Like, you not getting married to Hammad.
[598.16] If you had gotten married to Hammad,
[604.39] sister and Nosheen would have
given you a lot of trouble.
[610.01] They would have never let you stay happy.
[613.30] I just, I just pray only one thing to God,
[619.00] that you get a really good proposal,
[621.67] and you go away from here, far away.
[627.34] So far away, that they don't
even think about you.
[634.55] Please don't cry, Mother.
[643.27] Oh, God.
[656.74] Zaid...
[663.05] -Sorry, Dad. I didn't see you, greetings.
-Greetings.
[667.26] -Where have you been since morning?
- At the university.
[670.12] Then I had a plan with some friends, 
so got a little late.
[674.76] I don't know when are you going 
to grow up, get responsible.
[679.14] -I don't understand.
-That is your problem.
[682.37] You just don't want to understand anything.
[685.63] Dad, just tell me, has something happened?
[688.39] You mean to say that when you return
home after having fun all day
[692.75] then I should brief you about everything
[694.21] What happened what didn't happen all day?
[696.50] -No, Dad, you are taking me wrong.
-Oh, so I am the one who is wrong?
[702.96] No, Dad, I just want 
to ask what the issue is?
[706.90] It's your responsibility to take care
 of the matters at home yourself.
[711.95] The day you are going to take interest
in the issues regarding your family,
[715.70] you are going to get
aware of them yourself.
[720.89] I don't know till when are you
going to live a duke's life.
[725.94] You have got no time. You know that your
elder brother has left after deceiving us.
[733.74] Dear you have to get married eventually.
[736.94] And the sooner it happens the better it is.
[739.57] Get Zoya married then?
[741.98] Why did I become unwanted
[746.59] {\an8}Nobody knows that
[751.18] Why did I become unwanted
[755.83] {\an8}Nobody knows that
[760.57] Have you ever asked Nosheen, where she
goes, when she goes and why she goes?
[769.76] You don't have time 
for anything else than yourself.
[775.98] You are going to get married tomorrow,
[777.66] how all of this is going to run, how
are you going to manage all this?
[782.22] Think sensibly.
[787.36] Or you won't have anything
left than regret.
[791.36] Good night.
[810.21] Such a big issue happened here 
and you didn't even tell me?
[815.34] I was about to tell you, Zaid, but...
[818.86] What do you mean by, 
"about to tell", Aima?
[821.84] I asked you so may time 
to tell me if there is a problem?
[825.28] This is not a small thing.
[829.07]  Aima, there aren't any secrets between us.
[833.17] You should have told me whatever it was.
[835.23] Do you know how much dad has scolded me?
[838.58] I was digesting one taunt 
and he was ready with another.
[843.35] Spoiled all my good mood. 
All because of you.
[847.52] Zaid, you were going to
the university then,
[849.95] I didn't want to spoil
your mood at that time.
[854.01] I wouldn't have gotten mad
with anger after knowing it,
[856.44] but at least I should know
what is going on in the house.
[859.13] You know, Dad's anger is valid this way.
[861.91] My sister stays out of the house
at night and I am not even aware of it.
[865.21] I thought of telling you everything 
before dad comes back.
[872.17] Why aren't you trying 
to understand me, Zaid?
[875.34] I couldn't have told you about Nosheen.
[878.89] But why?
[880.11] Because... because she
made me her confidante.
[884.70] -What?
-I didn't tell you because of that.
[890.32] Because she had asked for a favor
 in the name of friendship.
[893.59] I have been up all night 
because of Nosheen.
[897.11] And then mother got sick.
 I have been up all night.
[901.17] I'm sorry Aima, but I think you 
are responsible for all this as well.
[906.38] What?
[907.95] Because you helped her
getting out of the house.
[911.21] Zaid, I warned her that
what she is doing is wrong.
[914.71] You are two years elder than her.
[917.25] What do you mean warned her? 
You should have stopped her.
[919.37] And if she hadn't agreed
you should have told me.
[922.82] And what about the friendship 
that dad asked me to have with her?
[926.27] Her safety is most important.
[928.24] And just imagine if anything
had happened to her
[931.41] there would have been such a big issue.
[933.28] Zaid, I got really confused. I was
really scared. Didn't know what to do.
[940.87] Aima, we are supposed to be best friends.
[944.48] Please share with me whatever it is, okay?
[952.89] You just go to sleep, 
I'll take care of aunt.
[975.11] Oh, come on sister, at the end of the
day if you have to get her married
[979.12] then why don't you talk to the family
of that guy whom Nosheen is interested in.
[983.06] I don't know, 
Azmat is just going to strangle me.
[987.99] What is wrong with it?
[990.43] I don't know about all this,
 just do one thing for me,
[994.37] I just want you to find a really
good proposal for Nosheen,
[997.27] before her dad gets her married 
to any random person, Amber.
[1001.02] Okay, fine, sister,
[1002.74] I'll look for a nice proposal, 
a  good option for Nosheen.
[1008.56] I just don't want that my daughter has to live
with restrictions even after getting married.
[1014.48] As I said,
[1016.36] I will try my best to find 
a good proposal for Nosheen.
[1020.50] After all there is nothing 
that Nosheen lacks.
[1023.09] Yes, please do this for me 
as soon as you can.
[1025.94] You don't need to,
 I don't want to get married.
[1028.99] Nosheen, what is this nonsense?
[1033.57] Dear, you will have to
get married eventually,
[1036.51] and thee sooner it is done the better.
[1039.14] Get Zoya married then.
[1044.57] And you, don't start discussing your
personal issues with every other person.
[1055.00] Stop is , Nosheen. Go from here. 
I said, just go, just go.
[1064.71] Sorry, Amber, she has lost her mind
since yesterday, please don't mind.
[1084.96] I just pray one thing to God, 
that you get a nice proposal,
[1090.13] and then you go away from here.
[1095.63] Do you like me or not?
[1104.88] It's just you...
[1108.56] that I like.
[1111.35] -Really?
-Yes.
[1114.43] -Why?
-Because...
[1121.44] You are a very...
[1128.52] stubborn, someone who gets easily angry
 and an idiot friend of mine.
[1199.96] Here are photos of some guys,
 and no excuse will work this time.
[1205.06] Mom, let me just take a look today.
[1207.99] I should know who those unfortunate
people are who want to get married to me.
[1217.04] -What is this, Mom?
-What do you mean what is this, it' a boy.
[1222.05] Just look at him, seems like he has
sent picture to audition for modeling.
[1227.33] Well, that's nice then, it's
going to be a nice pair.
[1230.44] Please, Mom.
[1232.88] Okay, look at this one.
[1236.47] What are you doing?
[1239.89] This... this, why have you set up
 this flee market of boys.
[1244.42] -You have so many issues.
-Okay, okay, I'll take a look.
[1254.04] Reject...
[1256.39] Reject...
[1260.88] Reject...
[1262.78] Zoya,you just took a
look and rejected them?
[1266.07] Mom, I have got eyes, and I can see.
[1270.71] Okay, forget it, show me
some more samples....
[1274.12] I mean show me more boys.
[1276.32] Just leave it, you don't
want to look at them,
[1280.32] you are just doing this to please me.
[1283.39] Mom, it's not like that.
[1286.17] Yes,  am marrying so that you get happy,
[1289.88] but it's okay, show me more guys, okay?
[1298.90] This one seems better.
[1300.70] Thank God, at least you liked someone.
[1303.72] Mom, they both are better.
[1307.32] Yes, but this, look at this one, 
isn't this one nice?
[1311.95] -He is from media, and I think he is a director.
-So?
[1317.02] Well so, you can follow
your passion this way.
[1320.29] Mom, Zoya doesn't want
 to use anyone's reference.
[1323.13] And please, don't get too happy, 
I am just looking at these pictures,
[1326.63] I haven't said, " I agree" thrice yet.
(haven't been married to them yet.)
[1328.56] Well, " I agree" starts 
from here, isn't it?
[1331.46] I'll do one thing, get details 
of these three boys, and let you know.
[1337.27] Mom, you don't need
 to get information from anyone.
[1341.93] Do you know what their names are?
[1343.80] I have no issues 
with someone marrying of their own choice.
[1346.73] I have an issue with that girl's choice.
[1348.50] That guy is a scumbag.
[1350.58] Why did I become unwanted
[1355.03] {\an8}Nobody knows that
[1359.75] Why did I become unwanted
[1364.36] {\an8}Nobody knows that
[1369.71] Yeah, it's written here, Azam Shah.
[1379.50] Azam Shah.
[1382.03] You just wait, let me get information 
about him in just two seconds.
[1391.00] Mom, he doesn't even know
 how to take a selfie.
[1398.50] What the hell are you doing?
[1401.14] And he is a doctor as well, hmm.
[1404.94] -So what?
-And he is an engineer too?
[1412.51] Mom, he has shared such a cheap post.
[1414.71] And the pages he has liked, 
I won't even look at them.
[1418.44] He is such a sad soul.
[1420.49] Zoya, what is this nonsense 
what are you looking at?
[1424.59] Mom, this information is accurate.
[1427.02] Because if you ask the match makers,
[1429.42] they present the guys as angels.
[1432.94] Mom, he has had a break up four months ago.
[1438.66] Poor guy.
[1440.37] Thank you so much, 
you provided entertainment in my life.
[1446.87] Where is the other picture?
[1450.19] Zoya...
[1453.03] -At least, leave one, just one.
-Forget it, just leave it. Come on.
[1522.52] Nosheen, what are you doing?
[1527.37] I feel really low.
[1529.83] If I hadn't drink it, I would have fainted.
[1533.42] I had made it for mother, 
so that her BP remains normal.
[1537.58] So what? I just told you 
my BP is really low too.
[1543.29] Nosheen, you could have made it
 for yourself too.
[1546.20] I have become sick like aunt
 by staying in this house.
[1552.75] If I hadn't drink it I would have fainted.
[1555.89] And there is no one 
who cares for me so much.
[1557.90] That if I faint, he would pick me up 
and take me to the hospital.
[1563.15] By the way, hadn't I been sick, 
I would have made it better than this.
[1569.19] What are you trying to prove with all this?
[1572.19] That the days when I used to go 
to college were better for you.
[1577.17] It was your own fault,
[1578.81] that doesn't mean at all that you
take out all your anger on me.
[1584.96] Listen, make another glass
 of juice for aunt.
[1589.68] She won't drink from what I have left.
[1592.11] And there is a lot to drink
and eat in this house,
[1595.56] for those who belong here and
for those too who are outsiders.
[1600.42] And there is a juicer as well.
[1603.69] And you can use electrical appliances too,
because the bill has been paid by dad.
[1611.62] I don't know how can you be
 at ease after doing all this?
[1621.58] You are so innocent, Aima. You started
crying on such a petty thing?
[1627.05] Nosheen has just started right now.
[1638.71] It's not that bad.
[1646.90] Listen, don't go to sleep, I have
asked them to make tea for you.
[1652.62] Wake me up when it's here.
[1655.87] -Listen.
-Hmm?
[1658.25] I know you are really angry at Nosheen.
[1661.49] but why don't you consider 
that she is so young.
[1667.94] Listen to one thing carefully, I am not
going to forgive that girl at all.
[1673.09] Tell me, do you actually want
 to get her married?
[1676.62] Why? What do you think, am I joking?
[1679.97] I thought that you said it 
just to scare her.
[1683.56] Had she one of those who get scared,
[1685.17] she would have corrected herself
after the first time I excused her.
[1687.44] Look, what I'm going to say now, 
just listen to it with a cool mind.
[1694.06] Look, it's the fast age.
[1696.83] Till when are we going 
to look away from all that.
[1699.80] Girls and boys these days
 are very independent.
[1703.49] Come to the point, Almas.
[1705.90] I was just saying that,
what if we call and meet
[1708.44] the parents of that guy
whom Nosheen meets?
[1711.19] That's out of the question!
[1712.96] Just think about it with a cool mind.
[1715.05] I am thinking, but I think
you have lost your mind.
[1719.63] Azmat if we have to fix her marriage,
why not fix it where she wants?
[1724.71] I have no issues if one
marries with one's choice.
[1727.70] I have issue with that girl's choice.
[1729.64] That guy is a scum bag.
[1731.76] Azmat, How can you say that 
without even meeting or seeing anyone?
[1736.83] I have seen the world.
[1738.68] Guys who want to marry girls,
[1741.04] They marry them in an honorable way,
they send a formal proposal for them.
[1747.31] They don't roam around with them
in the middle of the night.
[1750.72] The relationship which begins with a lie,
[1753.33] that relationship can never
be successful, understand?
[1757.17] He is a worthless guy.
[1759.27] Don't know where he took my daughter
in the middle of the night,
[1762.99] by lying to her, tempting her.
[1766.44] And you want me 
to make that guy my son-in-law?
[1769.94] I won't hire such a guy 
as a petty worker in my company.
[1774.46] Such a loafer.
[1779.32] What are you thinking now?
[1781.19] I was thinking that Nosheen
wouldn't agree that easily.
[1785.21] What kind of a mother are you?
[1786.56] Why don't you tell your daughter
what is better for her?
[1789.62] Her studies have also been interrupted.
[1792.06] Fine, put the blame of that on me too.
[1798.12] Look, it's better to get Nosheen
married as soon as possible.
[1803.18] Before she shines our name even brighter.
[1809.45] Like your eldest son.
[1836.45] -Aima, look here.
-Hmm?
[1843.12] Which one?
[1844.66] - None.
-Man...
[1850.28] Zaid, you are going to say,
"Aima, choose a shirt."
[1853.42] Then I'll tell you, " Wear this one."
[1856.29] Then you'll say,
"Aima please iron it for me."
[1860.01] Seems like I have 
to think of some other trick.
[1862.91] Please, Zaid, go, I have 
a lot of work to do, just don't bother me.
[1867.69] Aima, you know well that I only like 
to wear clothes that are ironed by you.
[1872.00] Even dry cleaners are nothing
in front of you. Please do it.
[1879.86] You know, it starts tasting
bad when you butter too much.
[1882.45] Okay, do it just today, for the last time.
[1887.46] It's a special day today.
[1893.06] I'm going on a date 
with your would be sister-in-law.
[1899.53] What? Didn't Zoya tell you?
[1904.24] By the way, tell me one thing, honestly.
[1911.05] Don't you like Kinza either?
[1914.28]  No.
[1916.71] Well I thought you won't because 
Zoya doesn't like her that much.
[1922.29] And whenever I mention her, 
why do you make a long face?
[1927.06] No... it's nothing like that.
[1931.14] Neither I like her, nor I find her bad.
[1936.25] That's a very politically correct statement.
[1938.28] Okay then at least tell me
how do we both look together?
[1944.65] Yeah, fine.
[1947.35] Aima, tell me in detail, what is this?
[1951.44] Zaid, what should I say?
[1952.69] Okay tell me, how do you find 
our chemistry, you know, as a couple?
[1959.11] I am asking you because those who are 
in love, everything seems perfect to them.
[1964.32] So, at times it's important 
to take an outsider's opinion.
[1969.78] Outsider?
[1971.19] I mean the love circle between me
and Kinza, you are out of that.
[1976.29] That's why, outsider.
[1982.85] -Okay.
-What Okay?
[1985.09] Give me you opinion
I am asking you seriously.
[1988.94] Zaid, do whatever you feel like doing.
[1993.03] Oh, it's all the matter 
of this stupid heart.
[1998.10] Zaid, go now, stop this drama.
[2000.15] This isn't drama, dear.
[2002.00] If you had fallen in love with someone 
you would know what love is.
[2009.35] It makes a person blind, completely blind.
[2014.59] Ask how?
[2021.19] -Hmm, how?
-Let me tell you, wait.
[2028.77] Like that.
[2044.00] Why did I become unwanted
[2048.59] {\an8}Nobody knows that
[2053.22] Why did I become unwanted
[2057.77] {\an8}Nobody knows that
[2062.97] I just don't understand 
what Zaid saw in Kinza.
[2067.25] Was she the only one to fall
 in love with? I detest her.
[2072.32] Don't know what she saw in her.
[2074.12] Zoya, I can't say
anything about this.
[2076.81] You are allowing the proposals
coming through dad too
[2079.06] and you have asked auntie 
for my proposals as well.
[2083.50] Zaid...
[2088.77] I like you.
[2096.05] I really like you.
