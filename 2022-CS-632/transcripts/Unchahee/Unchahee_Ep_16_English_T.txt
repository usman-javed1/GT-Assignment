[0.14] From flowers and from buds
[4.77] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.39] When I saw you
[14.51] I learned how to chirp from you
[18.92] At least tell me who is the guy?
[22.59] How is the family?
[27.03] Enough, Dad. Enough of your drama.
[32.40] What do you think? I'll marry and
that too with a boy of your choice?
[35.23] Stop this nonsense!
[38.86] I can't believe my eyes,
[43.10] what I've just seen.
[47.12] I just don't understand what had gotten
into brother, he never does like that.
[53.84] Mother, Nosheen must have done
something wrong.
[75.44] Zaid,
[77.52] I've been looking for you since forever,
and you are sitting here.
[81.37] The tasks that dad gave me
regarding the wedding,
[84.82] related to the event,
I was just looking after that.
[87.43] That all right, but you can at least reply
to my messages.
[92.19] What? Actually, I'm sorry.
[95.41] My mobile's battery died
so I was charging my phone.
[98.63] I didn't check my messages.
[99.78] Okay, tell me,
why are you sitting like this?
[103.71] Just feeling a little low.
[106.47] Zaid,
[108.94] you should've told me.
[112.55] Oh, this Zoya...
[114.39] Not everyone keeps secrets like you do.
[118.16] -It's not like that, Aima.
-Look, Zaid, I'm really sorry.
[124.61] Aima, you are saying sorry?
[129.09] Why?
[131.32] I... had I told you all this
on time then all this...
[136.75] Please, Aima it's over now.
[138.62] And it's no use of repeating one thing
over and over again, just forget about it.
[142.81] Zaid, unless I share my guilt with you,
I won't be comfortable,
[148.61] and I won't be able to forget it.
[151.15] What are you guilty about?
I should be the guilty one.
[154.83] What are you guilty about?
[160.12] My sister has done such a cheap
and disgusting thing with you, I just...
[164.59] I'm not able to even look you in the eye.
[166.73] Are you insane?
What are you talking about?
[170.39] I just couldn't imagine
that Nosheen could stoop so low.
[173.37] Zaid, it's true that I got really hurt
because of it,
[177.13] but it is possible
that she didn't intend to do it.
[181.69] And how can you say that?
[183.14] Zaid, Nosheen isn't that sensible.
She is immature.
[187.27] She takes life as a joke.
[189.82] She is doing bad to herself more than me.
[194.00] That poor girl doesn't even know
[195.72] that the decisions she is making
can ruin her life.
[200.15] Aima, she has attacked
your most valuable thing, your honor.
[204.45] And you are calling her a poor girl?
[206.40] Yes, Zaid. It's not her fault.
I feel bad for her.
[210.79] What are you trying to say then?
Whose fault is it?
[212.94] Zaid she is a kid.
[215.32] When elders don't give proper time to kids,
[219.04] don't do their proper brought up,
[220.76] then their personality becomes like this.
[224.80] Like Nosheen is.
[226.23] Look, that is not an excuse.
[228.15] She doesn't get the license to do
anything just by calling her a kid.
[232.62] I know.
[236.39] But I've forgiven Nosheen.
[240.50] At least let her apologize herself first.
[242.59] Just see first
if she is actually ashamed or not.
[244.87] Mother says that forgive others' mistakes
for your own sake.
[250.01] No matter if they are ashamed or not.
[253.13] -Meaning?
-It means that
[255.35] God really likes those who forgive others.
[260.29] And when we forgive someone,
we are the ones who are most relieved.
[266.28] The heart is less burdened.
[268.26] Look, I want you to forgive Nosheen too.
[272.88] You have a big heart, Aima.
[275.59] A person who made sure that
you get humiliated,
[278.65] you have forgiven her without
even giving it a second thought.
[281.25] At times, one is not supposed to think
too much before taking a decision.
[286.64] You are right,
upbringing makes a huge difference.
[292.72] I wish mama had taught something
to Nosheen as well, like auntie.
[297.19] It's okay, Zaid.
Everything is going to be all right.
[300.33] Just forgive Nosheen now.
[303.16] Aima, please.
I don't have such a big heart.
[306.44] I have decided, I'm not going to talk
to Nosheen ever again.
[308.95] No, Zaid. Please don't do like that.
[312.46] Or else, I'd be embarrassed
[314.52] that because of me, two siblings
aren't talking to each other.
[321.14] Look, try to understand.
[325.41] Dad is already too angry with her.
[328.23] I don't want her to lose your support too.
[332.43] Zaid, she needs you.
[336.31] Please, think over it.
[345.28] Okay, let me get you a nice coffee.
[374.41] Thank you.
[381.30] -Greetings, Dad.
-Greetings.
[384.38] Dad, all the arrangements are done,
just the invitations are left.
[390.06] Okay. Just try
that there are minimum people.
[394.34] They are bringing 20-25 people,
we should invite the same.
[398.73] Our family is very social,
and we know a lot of people.
[402.27] How can we invite just 25 people?
[405.31] Just invite a few important guests
and get over with this event.
[409.37] The event will be over, but people
are going to ask too many questions.
[412.37]  They are going to say all sorts of things.
[413.99] What are you going
to say the the relatives?
[415.95] I'm not answerable to anyone.
[419.84] A thousands of questions will raise, Dad,
[421.88] like why are you getting her married
at such a young age?
[424.02] Why is the girl
getting married so secretly?
[426.30] People are going to raise questions
on her character.
[428.03] Those people are going to say all this
for some time, and then they'll stop.
[432.43] Dad, I just don't understand
that why do you think
[434.60] getting Nosheen married
is the permanent solution?
[439.00] I mean look at her. Her habits aren't
like that of a sensible and mature girl.
[445.07] Her own family isn't able to correct her,
why do you think
[447.79] that she'll change for the better after
being a part of some other family.
[450.74] It's like you are putting your problems
on someone else's head.
[456.90] She isn't ready to maintain a relationship
like marriage, Dad, and you know that.
[461.45] What should I do then? I can't think
of a better option than this.
[466.10] I know it's a risk.
[468.24] Yes, but it's a huge risk.
[472.58] When she'll get the responsibilities
of her household,
[474.04] then she is going to distance herself from
the activities that she is involved in now.
[478.61] Our dignity is still intact,
you should consider that enough.
[481.76] That is fine, Dad.
[483.70] But still, getting her married so secretly
would make people doubtful.
[487.24] They'll doubt only.
[488.67] But if she stays home like this,
some new trouble will be created,
[491.71] which she can do, in my opinion.
[495.68] People are going
to point fingers then, they'll despise us.
[498.01] What are you going to do then?
[501.25] Keeping her home
is an apprehension of turmoil.
[504.33] She won't even think
before taking a foolish step.
[507.51] And, Dad, what is the surety
[509.61] that she won't take
such a step after getting married?
[511.98] Everything will be fine.
[513.59] She'll have a husband then, and then
children. She'll be busy with her life.
[523.64] All right, Dad, whatever you say then.
[542.08] Seems like you are feeling better now.
[544.59] You have finally come out of your room.
[548.50] Yes, sister, with God's grace,
I'm much better than earlier.
[553.23] As if she actually is.
[555.40] Did you say something, sister?
[557.63] I just came to tell that I'm going out
to get some items of Nosheen's dowry.
[561.58] -I might get a little late.
-Okay, sister.
[565.70] So, these are the keys to my room.
[570.20] Keep them safely.
[571.60] Unlock the room when the maid is here,
[574.58] and stay with her.
[576.53] There is a lot of valuable stuff
in the room, okay?
[580.65] Okay.
[582.16] Sister, if you need any sort of help
from me then please let me know.
[588.92] If my illness wouldn't
have been a hindrance,
[590.89] I would have helped you with everything.
[594.27] Just stop it. Don't hurt me
by saying all this.
[597.62] No, sister, believe me,
[601.80] I honestly want to help you
with everything.
[606.36] Of course, you both will help me
with everything very happily,
[610.28] because my Nosheen is leaving this home.
[612.65] Rather she is being kicked out
of the house.
[616.10] Whatever has happened,
[619.11] I am really sad about that, sister.
[622.80] Nosheen is very dear to me, just like Aima.
[626.45] Just leave it. There is always a difference
between what you say and what you do.
[631.23] Anyway, I don't want to create a scene
before Nosheen's wedding.
[636.16] It's better that you don't talk
to me about it.
[640.59] But, sister, I want that
[646.32] before she leaves,
she clears her heart from our side.
[653.01] Whatever misunderstandings there
are between us, they all should be solved.
[657.21] The Kashmir issue can be solved, but
the issues between us can never be solved.
[661.58] It's better that you just do
what I have asked you to do.
[665.38] I've given you the keys.
Please stay with the maid.
[670.42] Okay, sister.
[671.73] And listen, if you want to do any shopping
then let me know.
[675.37] Azmat said that he is going
to give his card for it.
[677.63] No, sister, I don't need anything.
[681.96] Whatever you need or don't need,
tell that to your brother.
[685.47] He told me and I've told it to you.
[688.14] Or else you'll complain that sister
didn't even ask us for shopping.
[693.82] Take care of the house.
[695.67] Okay.
[717.13] Auntie, has mama left
her room keys with you?
[722.58] Yes.
[723.93] My laptop is in mama's room,
I wanted that. So please give it to me.
[727.78] Yes, here it is.
[729.89] Lock the room properly
and give me the key back, okay?
[750.09] Nosheen.
[753.32] Nosheen.
[758.20] Nosheen.
[763.95] Nosheen.
[768.35] Dear, you left the door of the room open?
[773.67] Yes, actually I had to go in once again.
[776.55] Still, you know
that your mother's valuables are in there.
[781.87] What if something gets misplaced?
[783.92] Yes, you are right auntie.
Here, take the keys.
[787.42] Aren't you going in again?
[791.34] No I did what I had to do.
I don't have to go again.
[794.17] -Okay.
-Hmm.
[796.34] Okay, fine.
[804.28] That was close.
[807.57] What if she saw me?
[811.83] I just don't know, Amber, how to marry off
my Nosheen so suddenly just like that.
[818.14] I don't understand
what is the need to rush?
[822.98] It's not like Nosheen is getting overage.
[825.63] Weddings like these in
a rush and secretly take place
[828.39] only when there
is a problem with the girl.
[831.68] God forbid, why would there be
any problem with my Nosheen?
[835.43] Exactly, that's what I'm saying.
[838.68] There is nothing wrong with our Nosheen,
then what's the rush?
[842.66] You know how Azmat is.
So stubborn. He does what he has decided.
[847.84] Greetings.
[850.62] You are right about that.
[853.79] Honestly, no one can do anything
about his nature of rushing things.
[858.68] Or else, if we would have looked
for a proposal by taking time,
[861.83] we could have found a younger
and handsome guy for her.
[865.36] Wow, it's amazing that
after so much has happened,
[869.15] someone is ready to marry
Nosheen. Well, good for her.
[873.97] What are you talking about?
What has she done?
[877.19] Really? Usually, Auntie, you give
the news of whole world to mom.
[882.52] Haven't you told her
what your daughter Nosheen has done?
[885.41] Amber, don't believe
on rumors spread by anyone.
[890.72] All of it is because of
 these mother and daughter.
[894.84] I don't know anything about it,
at least tell me what has happened?
[898.96] What's it all about?
[901.82] Let me tell you, Mom.
[903.84] I'm not just accusing her.
[905.76] Or maybe auntie isn't able
to digest the truth.
[908.13] Amber you said your daughter isn't
ill-mannered. See, how is she misbehaving.
[914.17] Mom, I'm not misbehaving,
I'm just telling you the truth.
[918.18] And besides, Nosheen isn't that naive
nor uncle is a hasty person.
[922.47] Besides, no one gets their daughter
married at the age of 18.
[929.65] But if the girl gets out of control,
what other option do the parents have?
[935.48] Oh, God, look how sharp-tongued she is.
[938.79] I'm being insulted here.
[940.26] Oh, at least tell me what has happened?
[944.59] You should be thankful
that someone is ready to marry Nosheen,
[948.63] What she has done, there should
be a complaint filed against her.
[954.16] I think she should go to jail.
[956.48] Aren't you a bit ashamed, Amber?
[958.92] You daughter is like
hitting me with her shoes
[960.95] and you are just sitting and watching.
[963.55] Zoya, go upstairs.
[967.35] And, sister, at least tell me what is it?
[969.77] Is there anything left to say or tell?
[971.49] I thought I am being respected
in this house, but I was wrong.
[976.07] Sister, listen, please.
[979.39] Zoya, are you mad?
Is that the way to talk to your aunt?
[983.77] Mom, she hasn't told you
the whole truth about her daughter.
[987.77] Do you know what Nosheen has done?
[989.88] She tried to blackmail Aima.
[991.89] It's Aima's greatness
that she has forgiven her,
[994.20] or else a case should
have been filed on it.
[996.34] -What?
-Yes.
[1000.10] Sister didn't even tell me...
[1005.25] Oh, this Nosheen.
[1017.11] Thank God Nosheen
didn't create a scene today.
[1021.06] What do you mean?
When does my daughter create  a scene?
[1024.99] You know what I mean, Mom.
[1026.36] I'm just trying to say that she has
behaved very well in front of them today.
[1029.66] Which is quite surprising.
[1031.87] My daughter is very well-mannered.
[1033.85] If people just don't get
stubborn with her she is a gem.
[1037.97] Yes you are absolutely right.
[1041.34] You have taunted me all my life,
[1043.91] did you see how well my daughter
represented you today?
[1049.02] Appreciation is due.
[1051.11] I am going to appreciate her
when she proves herself in her in-laws.
[1055.68] Don't worry, she'll do that too,
God willing.
[1060.32] With God's will.
[1062.38] I told you to give
the credit card to Shabana,
[1065.18] she has to get some stuff.
Did you give it to her?
[1067.96] There is still some
shopping left that I need to do,
[1069.80]  I'll give her in a couple of days.
[1071.39] Are you going to give her on the day
of wedding? I told you to give her earlier.
[1074.49] All you are worried about is her.
[1078.78] Don't worry, Dad, I'll take her shopping.
[1082.77] Dad, I checked the guest list again,
there are around 80 people in total.
[1088.53] Eighty people? I said that the ceremony
should take place in a simple manner,
[1092.35]  who increased the guests then?
[1098.07] Azmat, do we have something to hide,
[1102.62] that our guest list needs to be so concise?
[1105.11] There was a reason why I asked to do so.
[1110.34] It has come to this figure even after
I am not inviting so many.
[1113.96] I have a very big social circle.
[1115.59] Yeah right,
[1116.91] what else have you done all your
life than increasing your social circle.
[1120.30] So, shall I get the arrangements done
accordingly then?
[1129.37] I wanted to ask you something.
[1132.80] My answer even before you start is no!
[1139.13] At least listen to me first.
[1141.57] Hammad is not going to attend the wedding.
[1150.19] What kind of a father is he?
[1152.45] His heart doesn't melt
even when it comes to his children.
[1156.49] What are you saying, Mama?
[1158.89] If I die tomorrow, he won't let Hammad come
to even carry my corpse to the graveyard.
[1164.00] Mama.
[1167.54] I can understand, Mama.
[1171.59] After all I am related
to brother Hammad too.
[1175.47] And when someone close to you
goes away from you then it hurts.
[1180.35] Only your auntie
and her daughter are close to you.
[1192.94] Okay then,  get ready tomorrow.
We'll go for shopping together.
[1195.81] Zaid, there is no need for that. I've got
so many clothes, I can wear anything.
[1199.94] Zaid, there is no need.... What do you
mean, are you going to wear old clothes?
[1202.59] Old clothes don't mean
[1204.60] that I am going to wear some
rags picked up from the streets.
[1208.41] Don't you worry,
I'll look good in whatever I wear.
[1213.10] Oh, please. Just stop it and keep quiet.
You are coming with me tomorrow morning.
[1217.83] Zaid, I told you, I don't need it.
[1220.91] Okay, at least come with me
to get auntie's dress.
[1226.83] -Zaid, did you talk to Nosheen?
-I will.
[1230.03] -When, Zaid.
-After a while.
[1232.62] Nosheen doesn't have
so much time left here.
[1237.31] Zaid she is here just for a few days now.
[1239.99] -At least talk to her, please.
-Okay, Aima, I'll do it.
[1244.77] She needs you. You are
her elder brother, so prove it.
[1249.67] -There are so many issues.
-What's wrong?
[1252.59] Kinza is upset with me again.
[1259.07] Why?
[1260.60] Actually, I couldn't give
her much time past few days.
[1262.39] And when she asked
what I was busy with,
[1264.26] then I told her that I had
few issues in my family.
[1266.34] In return she said, 
no you aren't serious about me at all.
[1268.95]  Had you been serious,
you would have told me the details.
[1271.91] I mean, what should I do?
[1275.31] So, why don't you invite her
at the wedding?
[1280.32] In fact that would be even better.
She could meet dad and auntie.
[1285.71] Oh, wow, why didn't I think of that?
[1287.85] You're a genius.
[1289.36] That's right, killing
two birds with a stone.
[1291.90] Kinza gets happy too,
and mama and dad will get an idea too.
[1295.30] In fact, let me text her right now.
[1327.34] Hello, Faisal, I'm ready, are you here yet?
[1330.73] Okay, I'm coming.
[1333.21] Oh, I'm such a fool.
[1343.13] Let alone humans, even the animals don't
want me to get married with my own choice.
[1359.42] Shall I get you some breakfast?
[1361.22] I'm sorry, I disturbed you both this early.
[1366.79] No, Dad, it's nothing like that.
[1369.69] Actually nobody else is awake
in this house so early other than you two.
[1372.58] Brother, we really like it
when you come and sit with us.
[1378.80] Tell me something, why aren't you both
doing any preparations for the wedding?
[1383.81] Why aren't you buying
any dresses or anything?
[1385.89] Dad, I have told Zaid,
[1388.72] I have got two dresses at home,
already, that I wore at a wedding.
[1392.91] They are very expensive.
[1394.34] So, I thought I'm going to wear them.
[1396.73] Aima is right, brother.
[1398.66] And you know well about me.
I don't have to go anywhere usually,
[1402.08]  so what am I going to do with clothes?
[1404.80] So, who has stopped you?
Who has stopped you from going anywhere?
[1408.72] I want you to go out.
[1410.62] You have confined yourself in the house.
[1414.90] Where shall I go, brother?
[1418.13] I don't feel like meeting anyone.
[1421.74] Shabana, the problem is,
that maybe you have no idea,
[1426.90] that happiness is in one's own hands.
[1431.33] If you don't want to get happy
then sadness will become your fate.
[1437.44] You get my point?
[1439.17] I like it. A wedding is taking
place in the house,
[1442.30]  I'll be really glad seeing you
both go out and get ready.
[1446.51] -Yes, Dad.
-Okay, brother.
[1450.38] Look, there is a wedding,
then there will be dinners.
[1453.70] This series of gatherings will carry on
for long and we'll have to be a part of it.
[1458.70] So, it's better that you both go
to the market and do some shopping.
[1463.53] I'll ask Zaid, he will take you both out.
[1467.79] Brother...
[1470.23] What is it?
[1472.26] I wanted to talk to you
about something important.
[1476.84] Yes, I'm listening, what is it?
[1479.87]  Brother,
[1483.66] consider this as a request
from me, brother.
[1488.40] Shabana, you don't need to make
grounds to start a conversation.
[1493.54] Say it, I'm listening.
[1495.50] Brother, I want that
[1500.86] before Nosheen gets married
and goes away, you forgive Nosheen.
[1507.82] Yes, Dad. Mother is right.
[1513.60] I have forgiven Nosheen as well.
[1517.51] Look, brother,
[1520.89] It's a very difficult
time for girls when they
[1523.54] have to leave their home
after getting married.
[1525.99] Leaving their home,
[1528.93] and going away
from her parents and siblings,
[1532.81] keeps bothering them for so long.
[1536.29] Look, right now,
[1539.22] Nosheen needs support from all of us.
[1543.57] And specially she needs
your love and affection a lot.
[1552.90] Look, brother,
[1555.42] please listen to me. Forgive her.
[1564.21] Fine.
[1586.19] Durrani!
[1588.35] What happened?
Did you find her?
[1589.38] No, madam, I have looked for her in
the whole house, I haven't found her.
[1592.51] -Did you look at the roof top?
-Yes, madam.
[1596.97] -Okay, let me know when she comes.
-Yes, madam.
[1607.36] Where has she gone this early,
and her phone is switched off too.
[1611.62] She must have gone to meet that Faisal.
[1616.61] No matter how much
I explain her, it's no use.
[1631.40] Wow, no one was listening to me,
and when dad said you agreed instantly.
[1636.93] Zaid you know well that I never say no
to dad, he is my elder.
[1640.82] This way I am you elder too,
I'm two months elder than you.
[1644.55] You should listen to me too.
[1646.32] Mother, only you can enjoy his silly jokes.
[1650.89] There is a thing called sense of humor.
Something that has even crossed you.
[1655.84] Besides, only a jeweler knows
the worth of a gem, am I right , auntie?
[1659.89] Okay, so if your stand-up comedy
is over, can we leave?
[1665.37] -Why? Isn't auntie coming?
-No, son, I'm not coming.
[1669.90] I get agitated in crowd.
[1674.18] What about your dress then?
[1676.46] I have told Aima, she’ll get my dress.
[1682.81] And what if there is an issue of your size?
[1685.02] Mother is not going to get 
a ready made dress, idiot.
[1688.08] Aima. you're not supposed to say like that.
[1695.81] Dear, she will get the cloth for my dress.
[1698.67] We'll give it to the tailor 
and he will stitch it right away.
[1703.82] -Okay, fine.
-Anything else you would like to ask?
[1708.13] Yes. Tell me auntie, 
why is she so mad all the time?
[1713.60] Okay, enough. Now you guys should go, 
it''s already too late.
[1718.76] -Let's go.
-Okay, Mother. Take care of yourself.
[1737.04] Yes, that's all right.
[1739.11] Me and Zaid are going to take care 
of the rest of the arrangements of dinner and all.
[1742.63] But please don't leave 
anything else out.
[1744.94] They’ll be done. Don't worry about money.
[1747.71] Look, the things is, 
our guests shouldn't have any complains.
[1753.43] Okay then let me know.
[1755.75] No, no, how will they go there?
Yes, exactly. Okay, good bye.
[1762.39] I was talking to the decoration guy.
[1766.99] He is a very old vendor of ours.
[1769.80] He's been working for us since 
so many years. See how times change.
[1773.15] I got Nosheen's Aqeeqa's
event decoration from him
[1776.83] And now he is doing the arrangements 
for her wedding too.
[1782.13] Anyway, everything is mine 
and Zaid's responsibility.
[1785.85] Except for Nosheen. 
She is your responsibility.
[1789.07] What do you mean?
[1790.17] I mean the wedding dress, make over, 
shoes, take care of all these things.
[1794.57] Besides, try to do what she wants.
[1799.03] After all she agreed to what I asked her.
She accepted my decision happily.
[1802.67] So, I want that the rest 
is according to her choice.
[1806.56] She shouldn't have any complains.
[1811.52] It''s a huge responsibility 
to get kids married.
[1814.71] And you know about me,
whatever I do I do it with all my heart.
[1819.93] Yes that's true about you.
[1822.82] Well, it''s good that I'm not
the only one who thinks that way.
[1828.38] Okay me and Zaid are going to take care,
[1830.54] but you should also 
entertain the guests well.
[1832.87] Nothing should lack in our arrangements.
Specially for the groom's family.
[1836.53] Of course, that's understood.
[1841.57] What's wrong? You seem worried.
[1846.00] No, no. It's nothing.
[1849.14] I know, dear wife. 
I have burdened you a lot
[1853.07] by taking such 
a huge decision so suddenly.
[1855.43] It's very difficult for you to
marry off your daughter like this.
[1858.76] But what could have I done? I had to do so.
[1862.45] I hope you can understand my position.
[1867.19] Don’t worry, I have made arrangements
for her comfort after marriage too.
[1872.27] Just these few days
are going to be difficult,
[1873.91] everything is going
to be fine then.
[1879.20] If you need anything let me know.
[1882.92] No, no. Everything is fine.
[1886.13] Do you have any complains, dear wife?
[1888.96] No, I'm content with your decisions.
[1893.99] Thank God. How did you like 
the groom and his family?
[1897.41] The groom is nice, so is his family.
But his age is more and his hair...
[1903.56] All these things are secondary.
[1905.92] The difference in age is not a big deal.
[1909.99] But it's good that you liked the proposal.
[1914.19] I wish Nosheen likes it too.
[1917.08] Okay, I’ll be right back.
[1920.93] Do one thing, send her 
to me while you leave.
[1923.89] -Who?
-Nosheen, who else?
[1927.66] Do you want something from her?
[1930.69] Before she leaves, I want her 
to clear her heart from my side.
[1935.94] I don't want her to think of me 
as a cruel person forever.
[1940.04] She needs to see my softer side now.
[1943.10] That's why I’m calling her.
