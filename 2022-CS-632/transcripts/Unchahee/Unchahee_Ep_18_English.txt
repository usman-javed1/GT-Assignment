From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you This is such an old house. Doesn't seem like someone
has been living here. When one goes out for shopping,
it takes a while at times. What kind of shopping is this?
She has been gone before I woke up. She hasn't returned yet. You don't even know
when she gets out of the house. Is there a thing called shame in you? Who makes such a girl their honor
who has run off from her house. Is that how she thinks about me, Faisal?
You said your mother knew about us. Zaid, I'm not defending anyone here. I'm just saying
that it's not just Nosheen's fault. Right, right. So according to you
she should be given a medal on this, right? What is wrong with you? Zoya, why don't you understand that
me and dad look at the world differently. We just wanted to protect
a girl of our house. We know the difference between
a noble man and a scoundrel. Which you guys don't know. And hand Nosheen chosen a noble guy,
what issue would dad have with it? Just think about it. but the truth is that
this is Nosheen's character. And she is proven it too, now. I was thinking to look
for Faisal on social media. And what would this do? He might have uploaded some picture,
he might have checked in somewhere. We might get to know where he is. But how are we going to get his ID? I'll just stalk Nosheen's profile,
I might find something from there. All right, give it a try,
I'll try to find out myself too. Dad. Can I sit here with you? I completely understand your agony, Dad. I know you are in too much pain. First I created problems for you
and now Nosheen. Why are you apologetic
about that incident, Aima, which was not even your fault? I made a mistake after all, Dad. I know, you have never bothered me
intentionally, Aima. You have been very upset
in the past few days First because of me, then
mother's health, and now such a huge shock. Well difficulties are a part of life, dear. Yes, Dad, and their solutions too. Just don't worry.
God will make everything all right.. And you'll see that Nosheen
will be back. She is our blood. I'm sure she won't repeat any mistake now. She will return to us eventually. I don't care about her anymore. No matter if she lives or dies,
her liveliness is useless for me. No matter how she lives, I am not bothered about it. I can understand your emotions, Dad. A father who works so hard to fulfill
even the smallest desires of his children, he can't give up this easily. He can't lose hope on them like this. Children are parents' hope. And they diminish that hope themselves. This sorrow is no less
than the sorrow of death. Where having a child is a blessing,
it's a test along with it too. You are right, Dad. God tests people by
giving some people and by not giving some. And at times, He gives someone
and then takes it back to test them. Yes. He is definitely testing me
and I have failed this test. Please, Dad, I know you very well.
You are not someone who fails. Please, please just don't lose courage. A lot of people have
many expectations from you. You're with me, aren't you? Then I can never give up. Would you do one thing then? -What is it?
-You haven't eaten anything since morning, -Please have something.
-Okay. Get the food ready, I'm coming. Okay. Listen. I love you, dear. -I love you too, Dad.
-Bless you. Faisal, where were you for so long? I've been waiting for you. You? Who are you
and what are you doing here? Don't be scared.
I live here, this is my house. Are you Faisal's friend? -Where is Faisal?
-I don't know. -Call him then.
-I don't have any credit in my phone. You are lying, right? I said call Faisal right now. Listen girl, he will come when he has to. I don't know, call Faisal right now
or let me talk to him over the phone. What did I say? Lower your tone.
Don't you get it? I won't, what are you going to do? To hell with you guys,
do you think I'm mad? Look, if you misbehave again,
you will have to face consequences. You should be thankful that even after
this behavior your dignity is still intact. Just let me talk to Faisal once. -No.
-Okay then tell me when Faisal will be back. I don't think he will return now. If he had to come he would have by now. It's better that you look
for a new place for yourself. Just listen to me, please. Don't bother me anymore. I'm not your servant
that I keep answering you. Go and sleep. Mom, what's will happen next? I don't understand myself. Sister has cried her eyes out there, and brother Azmat hasn't come once
to check up on her. Zaid was really disturbed too. Obviously, it's such a disturbing thing but everyone there is sitting
in their rooms by themselves. Problems aren't solved this way until you sit together
and discuss about it. You're right, Mom.
They are such a strange family. They just don't connect together. And then that madam, she did such a thing
that what was left is over now. -You're right.
-Just stay away from all this issue, okay? What do you mean? Means, don't try to advise too much. Our job is to console them only, the rest is their private matter. Mom, I keep my distance with them and what if they blame us
for something tomorrow. Besides, it's their personal matter. And because of uncle
I maintain my distance with them. That's a very good thing
that you keep your distance. Oh, I forgot in all this,
I wanted to tell you something. Mrs. Rashid has invited us friends
 tomorrow evening at her place. -Who?
-She is a lady who live nearby. Her house is in front of the park. I think you must have seen it. That house
is the most beautiful one in that area. Did you find about Faisal? -Yes, he has left for Dubai.
-Dubai? What's this nonsense? This can't be true. Look, one thing is clear
that he won't return now It's better that you pack
your bags and leave. Me? Where should I go? I don't know that. But it's not right for you to live with me. Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that She has invited all of us club members. And you must have found
some guy there, huh? Come on, Zoya, you are saying in a way
as if I am looking for a guy for myself. By the way, not a bad idea. Mom, I'm going to get
married eventually, so why don't you find
someone for yourself too. Not at all. When I didn't remarry after your dad
passed away, why would I do it now. Mom, that's all right, but You will be alone when I will get married. So you should get married after me too. Okay. for now you tell me,
when are you getting married? In about 4-5 years. Four to five years? Really? Mom, I'm kidding. I'll get married, just wanted
to see how you'd react. By the way, on a serious note, if I leave tomorrow,
then you will be alone here. What are you going to do then? The same. I'll take care of my house
and my business, what else. But still, I won't be with you. You must feel so lonely. I am lonely right now too. Come on, Mom, you are saying
as if I don't spend time with you at all. Oh, I'm not complaining. I know you've got your studies,
friends' get togethers, parties. When you get time after all this
then we get a chance to talk. But still, Mom, at least I'm near you.
even if we don't talk that much. Yeah, that's true. But you changed the direction
of the conversation. I was telling you that Mrs. Rashid's son
is really handsome. Mom, please don't say anything.
Every guy is just perfect for you. No, this one is actually one in a million. Every other guy is
one in a million for you. Will you let me finish first, please?
Just, listen, Zoya. -Mom, Iâ€™m listening carry on.
-No, first put your phone away. Keep talking, I'm listening. Faisal, what trouble have you put me into. You couldn't stand her for
a little while, imagine how have I been dealing
with her for the past two years. Well, you have minted money from her too. Now tell me how shall I get rid of her? Do one think, just scare her off. She isn't leaving, she is such a pain. She is after me that,
"Please let me talk to my Faisal." No way, that girl is just too clingy. She has been sucking my blood
like a lice don't know since when. Then tell me what should I tell her then? Tell her anything.
Tell her that I have left for Dubai. Wow, you have found
such an international excuse. Yes, she will be buy it
if we tell her about Dubai. Or else if she finds
out that I'm here, then she'll find me
and won't give up until I marry her. Well, why don't you marry her then?
We'll get to eat some biryani too. That's all what you can think of. Didn't I give you a 100,000/- rupees? And
another 25,000/- rupees for Aima's task. No have as much biryani
with it as you like. Well, haven't you embezzled 5 million
from her in just one stroke? I have taken such a big risk as well,
I deserve this much at least. And on thing is very clear, girls who can't be loyal to their parents
 how can be loyal to anyone else. You are right here. The girl has just
shattered her father's honor to spend her life with someone else. Now listen, start some proper business
with this money. Getting money from girls
like this is very risky. Well, this is a business too. Until there are such girls available who
are ready to sacrifice their parents' honor our business will keep running. That's true as well. Well, then send her away
as soon as possible. Where should I send her? She has nowhere to go now. She can go anywhere,
that's not our problem. And she ran off herself, we
didn't kidnap her. I have evidence. And get rid of her as
soon as possible or else she is going to
create trouble for you. Okay, fine. Let me tell her the news
about Dubai then. Okay, okay then, bye. Yes, Mr. Ishtiaque, I'm sorry. I really fell bad saying that to you,
but please, don't come tomorrow for the wedding. Not postponed, canceled. I regret to tell you that we have
to call off this wedding. No, no, we have no doubts
or complains from you. Just think of it as
this marriage wasn't meant to happen. Your concern
is absolutely valid, Mr. Ishtiaque. But please understand
that whatever is happening is in the best interest of you and me. The reason isn't worth
mentioning, but still I'm telling you so that
you don't stay in doubt. Actually, my daughter
is interested in someone else and I wasn't aware of this fact. Now, it would be wrong to get your son
married to her in such a situation. I just request you that to please keep my daughters secret,
I'll be obliged. thank you, thanks a lot. God bless your son. Did you find about Faisal? -Yes, he has left for Dubai.
-Dubai? What nonsense? This can't be true. Look, one thing is clear
that he won't return. It's better that you pack your
bags and leave from here as well. Me? Where should I go? I don't know that. But it's not right for your to stay here. -What do you mean?
-You know very well what I mean. Don't test my patience.
Pack your bags and leave. Where shall I go, where shall I stay? Go back to your home. Say sorry
to you father and stay at your house. No, dad won't forgive me. You should have thought about that earlier when you risked your father's honor for
a stranger and ran off from your home. I had no idea that Fai...
that scoundrel would do this to me. Oh, God, what am I going to do,
where am I going to go? With whatever you have done,
I see just one place suitable for you -and that is a shelter home.
-A shelter home? Yes, pack your bags and leave. At least let me stay here tonight. I'll leave in the morning. Fine, pack your stuff. When I get back in the morning
you should be gone by then. I don't want to see here. I have reached to the conclusion that I am going to limit my
principles to myself only. Kid these days want to do
everything with their own will. They want to make their life
decisions with full authority as well. This is how it is. Tell me when are you
sending your family? -Where?
-To my house with the proposal, you idiot. Yes I'm going to send them soon, very soon. In how many days? Tell me exact days. When I have told you once
that I'll send them, then I will. Don't persist on everything. Why are you getting angry, Faisal? You have returned my daughter to me. Is Zaid bringing her home? No need to celebrate.
She is not coming to this house. What do you mean she is not coming here?
Azmat, it's her home. No, no. This was her home. But all doors are closed for her now. Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that Dad, try to understand. If I shouldn't
bring her home, where should I take her? Dad, I have got no choice, try to understand. Dad... Dad! What happened, brother? What do you think? 
What would have happened? He refused, didn't he? I knew it. It's not like you've won a battle
that they shall welcome you at home. What happened? Why aren't
you saying anything? What is it? Was it Zaid's call? Did he find anything about Nosheen? Congratulations, he has found your daughter . Than, God. You have me my child back. Zaid is bringing him home, right? No need to celebrate. 
She is not coming back to this home. What do you mean she isn't
coming home, it's her house, Azmat. No, No, this was her house. But all doors all closed for her now. If you don't care about her, 
at least care about me. How am I going to live without her, Azmat? Please, whatever you do just
don't throw her out of the house. I can't live without her, Azmat. If you can't live then you can go 
with her too, nobody is going to stop you. What are you saying, Azmat? I promise you, she won't do such a thing again. You and your promises. If you were trust worthy, we
wouldn't have to face such a situation. But why am I telling you this?
It would make no difference to you. Azmat, what pleasure
do you get by hurting me? By distancing my children from me. Whatever is happening to you
guys is because of your own deeds. I have told once that she won't
come back to this house, and I mean it. Brother, tell me where
are you going to take me? Shut up and get in the car. Please come in. I just
came back a while ago. Please, sit down. She seemed really tired 
so I sent her to get some sleep. I guess she is asleep. She was crying a lot. Oh, God, I wish nothing bad 
has happened to her. She has been away for so many days. Sister, just think positive. Nosheen isn't that silly that she... Amber, I got no clue
what am I going to do with this girl. Sister, you should be thankful 
that at least we have found her. But what is going to happen next? Her father isn't ready to take her back,
till when is she going to stay here, Amber? The wound is fresh right now. 
It will heal with time. Brother Azmat is going 
to let him back too, you'll see. His wounds never heal. Did the wound given 
by Hammad heal till date? Or you can say that people 
around him don't let it heal. I am really worried about it, Amber. Don't worry, everything
is going to be fine. I wish that happens. Amber, I can't thank you enough. Thank you so much. -Oh, come on.
-No, really, In such situations people 
don't support you usually. You have obliged me by keeping her. What are you talking about. No matter
how she is, after all she is my niece. If she hadn't come to me 
where would have she gone? Besides, she can live here
as long as she wants. I will take care of her, don't worry. Amber, you have rendered 
my full right of being my sister. You'll see. Everything
is going to be fine. Brother Azmat is going
to call her back home too. God willing. Just don't worry. In fact you
can stay here as well, if you like. You will be at ease. Azmat is going to mind that. He doesn't
even know that Nosheen is with you. And you know about Azmat's temper. Okay, whatever suits you. But occasionally keep asking
brother Azmat to forgive Nosheen, okay? She is his child after all.
He can't forget about Nosheen. Every thing is going to be fine. 
Don't worry. Thank God, Nosheen is back home safe and sound. God has saved her from any kind of mishap. That is enough for me. I don't care about anything else. Did you talk to auntie? -Why?
-I didn't feel like it. She kept calling me but I didn't pick up. Zaid why are you doing so? 
Auntie needs you. She was calling you 
because she was worried. I don't think so. Mama 
and Nosheen don't need anyone. They have followed their will always. I can understand about Nosheen,
but why are you mad at auntie? Nobody takes such a huge step 
without anyone's support. And mama has always supported Nosheen. She never tried to discipline her,
neither she let anyone else do it. And she kept doing 
one bad thing after another. She was so proud on her daughter. And today, her own daughter deceived
her and she couldn't do anything about it. Look, whatever had to happen 
did happen. That's was the past. We have to rectify our present. No , Aima, if someone's past is tainted
then his future doesn't let go of it. And looking at our past, 
I don't think anything would change. Zaid please don't think so negatively. Everything is going 
to be fine with God's will. At times I think how selfish one gets, that he is unable to think
properly due to his selfishness. He doesn't even know what effect his wrong
decisions will have on people close to him. That's because a human is bound to err. No, Aima, there is a thin line 
between error and crime. And the difference is 
that after one commits a mistake he has a chance to return home. What can I say? I still think that God 
has been really kind to us that she is back home safe and sound. Tell me, how did you find her? I thought a lot about where Faisal 
could have taken her. And finally I thought of a place. -Which one?
-The same place where he called you. And that place isn't even his, 
it's his friends. The guy Nosheen was going
to marry is such a scoundrel. Zaid, didn't Faisal stop you
from taking Nosheen away? And didn't Nosheen insist 
that she doesn't want to come? No. In fact when I reached there Nosheen
was already about to leave from there. And by seeing me, she hugged me
as if she is really happy to see me. What happened then? Where did that guy go? And why was Nosheen leaving from there? I don't know. If Nosheen got happy after seeing you it means that that guy has defrauded her. Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that I need to go somewhere for
some work, so I'll need your car. Can you please ask the driver? This isn't possible 
because I'm going with the driver. And mama is going to work in her car. Will you talk to Azmat? About what? That he takes Nosheen back in. He never refuses what you and Aima say. Nosheen. That girl has cheated us again, Amber.
