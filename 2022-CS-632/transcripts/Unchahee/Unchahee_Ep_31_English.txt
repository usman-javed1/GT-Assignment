From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you You are getting married. And you know well that after getting
married the responsibilities increase. I'll be happy if you keep your focus on your
responsibilities more than your hobbies. Faiq, why don't you talk to me?
I've been missing you for so long. Do you know that I was with Aima? What if she got to know? I don't care whatever she thinks. -Did you see? Nosheen was here.
-Nosheen? With whom? No idea, she just left. The one I was talking to right here. -Oh , yes, yes.
-Who was he with? He came with a lady. So, he had to leave due to an emergency. Where did Nosheen go today? When? Today. Where else would she go. She might
have gone to college before I got up. She should have been in college
but I saw her somewhere else. Tell me, what is it that's bothering you? Do you think that Faiq is interested in me? What kind of a question is this? Just listen to me carefully once. On the stole with the red dress
you have to do golden peco, and on the stole with blue
dress you have to do red peco. Now please don't spoil my dress. Yeah, okay. So, tell me
when should I pick them up? Okay, fine, bye. Oh, God! The most difficult
thing during wedding days is to give instructions to the tailor. And after that? After that, understanding. Why are you asking me? I don't
know myself that's why I'm asking you. What's wrong? Why such a long face? No, not at all, I'm fine. Something has happened. Let me
guess, did you get scolded by dad? No, no, what's wrong? Then there must be just one reason 
behind it, you're missing Zoya. By the way, I too miss
Faiq a lot these days. Really? The real question is, 
does Faiq misses you too? Why did you ask this question? Just like that. Yeah, he must be missing me too. He must have told you, 
we met at the restaurant. Really? Which restaurant? What do you mean? Didn't he tell you? No, actually we didn't talk 
for the past two days. Is everything all right? Yeah, all is well,
he must be busy with his business. I'm sure he will call me once he is free. Didn't he even get time to call at night? May be he gets tired at night
and he doesn't feel like talking, so... Zaid, should I tell you something? I think that I have started liking Faiq too. Okay, fine, but don't you change 
after marriage, okay? -You don't change.
-I'm not changing, why would I change? If not you, Zoya might change. -No, we are going to stay the same.
-That's out of question. No, no, I have observed there is too
much discussion about Faiq going on. Don't you have any manners? 
Why are you checking my phone? -Why is Faiq messaging you?
-Mind your own business. Nosheen, I'm your elder brother,
I have a right to know. You are my elder brother, that doesn't mean
you are going to invade into my privacy. Just tell me the reason
why he is messaging you. What's wrong, why are you
creating such a big scene? Besides, anybody can talk to anyone. Anybody can talk to anyone, but there
is no reason that you two should talk. You don't need to bother, 
this is my private matter. This is not a private matter, Nosheen.
God dammit, Faiq is committed to Aima. Are you crazy? Back off. You went to the restaurant with
him the other day, didn't you? -Which day?
-Nosheen, don't act innocent, I know everything. Don't put these stupid allegations on me. -So, didn't you go to lunch with him?
-What proof do you have? Proof? The proof is in this phone,
show it to me. Give me the phone. Back off, have you gone mad? And I'm telling you, if you take
the phone forcefully from me then I... Forceful? What will you do? What? I'm, I'm telling you... Zaid, what are you doing, Zaid? 
Why did you snatch her phone? He has gone crazy. You should be thankful
that you didn't get married to him. What's wrong, Zaid? Nothing. What is it Aima? Everything all right? Yeah, I was just... Nobody cries without any reason. It's your best friend's wedding. And Zoya is coming to this house 
after getting married to Zaid. What's in it to cry? Faiq, I'm crying because 
I'm going to get married soon too. I'm going to move to your home. Zoya's departure from her house to
this house made me think of my departure. That's why I got emotional. Are you sure that's the reason? Why would I hide anything from you? No, I'm not bothered. I just came to say that  if there is
anything you can share it with me. Anything that you would
like to discuss, I'm here. Faiq, I don't get what
you are trying to say. Aima, I have a feeling 
that you are hiding something from me. Why would I hide anything from you? I have noticed that you have been
very disturbed during the whole wedding, and I didn't find it normal. I have told you that by
looking at Zoya's departure I was thinking of the time
when I am going to leave. I just got tearful by thinking that I am
going to miss all of these people so much. All the people in this house, 
the time I've spent here, my family. Your family or someone
specific in that family? Don't know how much longer 
do I have to sit like this. And this dress, it's so heavy. And these bangles, 
they are hurting my hands. No, mama said I should
stay like this until Zaid arrives. I'm getting suffocated in this dress. Where is he? Why are you sitting here? Actually my dress is too heavy, 
so I wasn't able to sit on the bed. So I sat here. I had an idea that I'm not
getting married to an ordinary girl. -So, can I sit here?
-Yeah, why not? In fact which book states that the bride
and groom can't sit on the sofa and talk? Thank God! You should have told me earlier, I would
have decorated the sofa instead of the bed. Are you making fun of me? Zoya! Zoya, what's wrong
with your make up? You lipstick isn't right too,
your eye liner, your stole... And your hair, I mean, I don't know but even after all that, 
you look very pretty. Honestly? Will I every praise you falsely? Thank you. Zoya, what is this nonsense? What's wrong? I mean, aren't you going to praise me? By looking at you, it
seems as if you are attending a poetic gathering
to recite your poetry. -Should I tell you something?
-Sure, go ahead. Please, I'm your husband. Okay, sorry, continue. The thing you said about poetic
gathering reminded me of something, I brought something for you. -What?
-No, forget it, you're going to make fun of me. Tell me, what did you get me? Should I tell? -You sure?
-Zaid... -Hey, Zoya!
-Don't tell me, Zaid, you've written poetry for me? -Just give it back, I...
-Wait a second, let me read. Is this the night 
Or have you let your hair down Hair let down. Is this moon light 
or is the night been -washed with my eyes.
-Washed? Is this the moon or your bangle? Means, you're going to write anything? Yeah, so,  just forget it then. Wait a second, I'm going to read it all. What's wrong with you? Nothing. Zaid, look at her eyes. I have an idea, Zoya, 
I know why her eyes are like that. Remember, when I used
to stay up all night missing you then my eyes
used to turn like that too. Stop being so dramatic. Okay, listen, should I tell Aima? What? She already knows it. Don't tell me that this was Aima's idea. No, it wasn't my idea, in fact I told
him that this idea with poetry won't work. Thank God. Is it okay? Hey, wait a second. I forgot to show you. Look at that. Zaid gave this to me last night. Isn't it beautiful? For your kind information, 
this was chosen by Aima too. Seriously, Zaid? For once, 
choose something yourself too. I have chosen you, what else do you want? Yeah, that's true. I said yes because of Aima. If it weren't for her I wouldn't
have said yes for marrying you. That's true, I agree. Zoya, tickets confirmed. We will have
to leave two days after Aima's wedding. Where to? For our honeymoon. 
You should come with us too. It's your honeymoon. What would I do there? You won't go alone. 
We'll take Faiq along too. Yeah, Aima, please come with us. It would be so much fun, 
both of us couples. -I don't think that it's possible.
-Everything is possible, you just agree. -But Faiq?
-I'll talk to Faiq. I have noticed, Aima, 
you're being very formal with us. It's nothing like that. I just want
to get personal space to you two. Hey, we don't want your personal space. Yeah, we all are going 
to stay together, okay? And you are coming to lunch with us. Done, it's done. No, that's not the right thing 
to do, everyone's going to object. It won't look nice. It doesn't matter if anyone has
any objection, we don't have any. -Isn't it so, Zaid?
-Yes, absolutely. So, it's decided, you are
coming to lunch with us. okay? It's so nice of you to visit today. Shabana, I was asking Faiq
for so long, he just didn't get time. How is your work going on? -Going good, uncle.
-That's great. Shabana, where is Aima? It's been
a full week that I haven't met her. Actually, sister Nimra, you know well that Zaid and Zoya
don't go anywhere without Aima. They insisted for dinner so she went along. Had you told me earlier that you are
coming then I would have stopped her. No, it's all right, let the kids enjoy. Besides, it's a matter of few days, Aima is going to depart
from this house too. -Are you done with your preparations?
-Than God, all preparations are completed,
now we need just Aima in that house. With God's will, Aima is going to go
to your house too in a couple of days. With God's will, for sure. -Excuse me.
-Yeah, sure. There are a lot of preparations to do in
a house where wedding is taking place.  It's really difficult to handle all of it. But all the hustle bustle 
is because of that. We wait for it all our lives. That's true. That's exactly how it is. What a pleasant surprise,
auntie, how are you doing? Very well, dear. Your dress is so pretty. Thank you so much, 
I got it as a gift from someone. Oh, you're here as well. 
Sorry, I took your place. -No, it's okay, please sit.
-No, please you sit down. Thank you. Hey, you're fond of
playing the guitar, right?  One of my friends is really fond too. I have a video of hers in my laptop. Come lets go to my room, I'll show you. Just send me her video,
I'll take a look at it in my phone. It's in my laptop, I've
been saving it for so long.  Just come, I'm going to show it to you. All right, let's go. -Have you made the guest list?
-Yeah, sure. All these things are going on. 
Besides I gave this task to Faiq. No matter if it's the bride's
house or the groom's house,  the things to do are similar at a wedding. Yeah, but the groom's family is happy
that they are going to take the bride away. Nosheen, you brought me here
in front of everyone. What must everyone be thinking? Faiq, relax, nobody is
going to think anything. And just don't stay afraid all the time. Okay, tell me, why did you bring me here? Just like that, because I wanted to. -Okay, I'll get something for you.
-No, I don't want anything. Just sit down, 
 and please don't be shy in front of me. You didn't have to. You never feel the need of anything. Nosheen, why are you so complacent? If you mind my complains, 
I'll stop it then. Nosheen, what are you doing? Faiq? Can't I do it? Look, this isn't right. What's wrong with it, Faiq?
Can't two people fall in love? -Try to understand, Nosheen.
-I don't want to understand, Faiq. Don't stop me please. Besides you are going
to be taken away from me in a few days. Nosheen, I can't do this. 
I'm getting married in a few days. Faiq, I'm just asking 
for a little time from you. A time where it's just you and me 
and our love. Can't you even spare a few moments for me? Fine, then. You should've told me 
when I came to your place. You should have thrown me out of your
house. Why did you get so close to me? Why do you talk to me 
over the phone all night long? Faiq why don't you
admit that you want it too? And you just don't have 
the courage to accept it. Don't lie to me, Faiq. Please come, Dad. -You look so pretty.
-Thank you, Dad. Aima, I'm sad too but happy for you too. Please don't be sad, Dad. I'll come to you whenever you'll call me. I want you to take care of all my business. And I don't think Faiq would
have any objection to it too. Sure, just don't worry, I'm
definitely going to fulfill your wish. This is for you. What is this, Dad? It's a small gift from my side for you. -What gift?
-I got a flat booked for you. These are the ownership documents of that. May this house be lucky for you. No, are you crying? You are not supposed to be sad my child It's the time to be joyous. These are tears of joy, Dad. You have never let me miss my Dad. Had father been alive today, he would
have taken care of me as much as you have. God took away my father from me. But he made you as
my guardian in his place. I'm happy for you, Aima. Just don't forget your dad 
after going to your in laws. I will never forget you. I love you, stay blessed. Greetings. Congratulations, Shabana
that we get to see this day too. -Greetings.
-Greetings. You both are looking so good together. See, you are getting praised
as well because of me. Zaid, you should value
your newly wedded bride. She has gotten old, 
the new bride is inside. Everyone seems better
than the other tonight. -I'll just go meet Faiq.
-Yeah, sure. Greetings, how are you? Nosheen, you look really good too. 
Just like a bride. She how expensive the setup is? Your father has chosen
several kinds of dishes to serve. He has gone insane 
after his sister and daughter. Had this been your wedding, he would have
kept reciting the lesson of simplicity. Why aren't you saying anything? Faiq, we won't let you go like
this. Aima is our very special cousin, and to reach her you
will have to pay a price. Faiq, don't give
them a single paisa. You know what they’re going
to do? They'll hide your shoe. It's better that you get a new shoe
after you go home, it will cost you less. Zaid, Faiq is not a miser like you, right? -Let's see.
-There you go, you got your answer. Faiq, the cleric is on his way. 
Are you ready? -Yes uncle, I'm ready.
-All right. You just take care of him. What's your problem, Nosheen? 
Why do you keep calling me? -Faiq, come to me right now.
-Are you insane? I can't come right now. You have to come. Faiq. If you won't
come right now I am going to kill myself. Hello, Nosheen? Nosheen, Nosheen,
what are you doing? I don't have any other option, Faiq. Marry me, Faiq. Marry me
or else I'm going to kill myself! Nosheen, Nosheen, please, look, it's too
late now. You have to accept this reality. What you are calling a reality is a lie. The truth is that we both
love each other, Faiq. And if you won't marry me, 
I'm going to kill myself. Nosheen, why are you insisting? I want to live with you, and if you
aren't in my life it's of no use then. Nosheen. -Man.
-Who are you looking for, Faiq? And even if someone arrives, 
what are you going to tell him? Don't do it, Faiq. There is still time.
Tell everyone that we both love each other. I'm telling you honestly, you will
never be happy by doing this marriage. Are you trying to blackmail me, Nosheen? No, I'm giving you an option. Like I did before that we should
elope, but you never took me seriously. But you will have to
take me seriously now. I wish, I wish you would have listened
to me earlier and we would have eloped. It wouldn't have
reached to this point then. But you have always
mocked my love for you. You have mocked me being so young. Mother's calling. Faiq, just listen to me.
Our future is going to be really nice. You will just have to
show a little courage. Tell everyone about us. 
I am going to support you, Faiq. -All right then...
-Nosheen! Zoya, what's going on? 
Where has everyone gone? I don't know, they have gone inside. I think auntie needs to talk to
them about something important. Okay, just don't worry. It must be
something, I don't know about it right now. Tell them Faiq how much you love me. Tell them that you used to come
and meet me by ignoring Aima. Tell them that we have met
privately at your place and at my place. I'm not going to let anybody
be unfair to Nosheen. And Nimra, you were just
talking about asking Faiq, right? I just met him and he
has admitted it himself that he wants to marry Nosheen. I don't care what you want. If you have fixed your marriage with
Aima, then you have to marry Aima.
