[0.00] From flowers and from buds
[4.57] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.16] When I saw you
[14.30] I learned to chirp from you
[18.63] Anyway, I came to know that Zaid
met an accident? How is he doing now?
[23.38] What can I say, mom?
[25.27] He is in a bad shape since few days.
[27.95] Few days? But he had
an accident just today.
[32.75] I will not use any of my rights
even after being Zaid's wife.
[39.38] I promise you that.
[42.42] Please, just let me...
[45.36] let me live in your house.
[47.68] You are serving Zaid
with a lot of devotion.
[52.19] Yeah, he wasn't able to do his
tasks so I was just taking care of him.
[57.94] You weren't here as well.
[59.39] And you thought of making
the most of the opportunity, right?
[63.36] I'm showing you these pictures so
that you think about our honeymoon.
[67.66] Otherwise why would I show you
someone else's pictures?
[71.01] Okay, we will go but
it's not the right time.
[110.26] Sorry, Mom.
[113.56] I'm so sorry that I have taken such a
huge decision without letting you know.
[118.67] I know you don't like it.
[121.89] So sorry.
[125.03] Yes, I went to Zaid's house yesterday.
[131.55] He isn't well.
[134.99] Even you would have felt pity
for him if you saw his condition.
[140.40] Mom, he isn't well at all, and I have
also felt that he isn't happy without me.
[147.57] And yes, it was really
important for me to go there.
[151.33] Had I not gone there then...
[154.53] He would have died?
[158.44] Something like that.
[161.69] Stop this nonsense, Zoya.
[165.26] And you can fall for the
drama they are creating, not me.
[172.27] And nobody dies without anyone.
[174.70] Mothers die but her
children stay alive without her.
[178.05] Mom, please calm down.
At least try to understand me.
[186.18] Only if it's about Zaid.
[188.35] I can't listen to anything
regarding him calmly.
[191.90] It's not about Zaid, it's about me, Mom.
[195.99] Besides, in this period I have realized
[199.31] that he is not the only
one suffering, I am too.
[202.61] I love him.
[207.31] And I can;t live without him.
[209.97] And I have also realized that
[215.12] just being together with
each other is enough for us.
[218.43] And I won't leave him.
[221.53] Really? Do you guys
love each other so much?
[227.72] Then what is Aima doing in his life?
[232.19] If there is no place in his heart
for her then why is she there?
[237.96] -How is it possible?
-Why not?
[242.17] If he can remarry even after
being married, why can't he divorce?
[249.34] And this is much more practical then 
the thing you said about him dieing and all.
[256.30] Listen to me carefully, Zoya,
[259.83] I won't let you do such a huge blunder.
[265.71] You can go back on only one condition.
[268.46] IF Zaid divorces Aima, only then.
[272.45] Okay, Mom, just let me go there and see. 
If Aima...
[278.63] No ifs and buts.
[280.52] You have to promise me
[282.37] that you are going to convince
Zaid that he should divorce Aima.
[294.13] Only then can you go back.
[297.85] Fine.
[322.36] I am quite perplexed right now,
[325.49] and I don't want you to refuse me.
[330.45] What is it, Dad?
[334.87] Aima, I...
[337.85] As a father I...
[341.40] I want to ask you that
[343.95] you get married to Zaid.
[357.59] No, what are you saying, Dad? This...
this can't be.
[366.42] My dear, this is the need of the time.
[370.17] Dad, me and Zaid?
[374.21] No, this can't happen.
[377.14] -This can't happen.
-Try to understand me.
[379.86] -I am helpless.
-No, this can't be.
[386.36] I'm not the first girl in this world
whose marriage has been called off.
[394.74] This can't be, what's the worst that can
happen? My past is going to be stained.
[400.79] People are going to say things about me.
[414.00] Son, if I ask something from
you I hope you won't say no.
[422.07] Go ahead, Dad.
[426.09] I hope that you
[428.71] won't say no, Zaid.
[431.44] Dad, tell me without any hesitation what
can we do that we get rid of our tension.
[436.17] Zaid,
[438.57] I want you to marry Aima.
[451.50] Just to take revenge of your niece
[455.56] you have destroyed my son 
and my niece's marriage.
[462.65] How am I going to face my sister?
[467.63] This marriage isn't valid.
[470.18] Don't know what did you say to him, 
or threatened him that he agreed for this marriage.
[478.16] A marriage done forcefully isn't valid.
[481.00] If you don't believe me then go
ask anybody, this marriage isn't valid.
[487.70] And as far as your niece is
concerned, it was her fate.
[496.74] My Nosheen has no fault in it.
[502.53] Don't you understand such a simple thing?
[506.47] Your stubbornness has destroyed everything.
Our happiness.
[512.22] You are a murderer.
[516.70] You are responsible 
for all this destruction.
[519.61] My children, my children...
[524.28] You weren't even there when
your only daughter was leaving.
[530.57] She has left like an orphan.
[532.81] You didn't even give you her blessings
when she was leaving for her in laws.
[558.54] Zoya, I can't tell you how
happy I am that you are back.
[562.25] It seems like I have got a new life.
[568.79] When... when you had left
[574.60] my life had turned dark.
[578.38] I had lost all hope, Zoya.
[584.31] I hope
[586.70] that you won't disappoint me again.
[588.61] No, I swear, never.
[593.48] By the way, can I ask you something?
[598.89] What was it that made you come back?
[604.12] What kind of a question is this?
[605.56] No, I mean, what was 
the reason that you came back?
[611.70] That doesn't matter, Zaid.
[614.19] The important thing is that I am back.
[618.63] I was thinking if you
could say it yourself that
[623.85] you have come back for me because
you love me, then I would have liked it.
[634.45] What is it? What are you thinking?
[637.52] Nothing, I was just thinking
[641.37] if the decision to come back
to you is even right or not.
[646.77] Listen, Zaid,
[649.23] I won't be able to trust you like earlier.
[655.71] You're right.
[658.53] I have actually lost your trust.
[664.71] Don't do anything in future
which makes me regret my decision.
[670.19] Never, I swear, never again.
[673.89] I will never take any
decision that hurts you.
[677.73] Nor will I let anybody
make such a decision.
[681.71] It's a promise and I won't let it break.
[686.80] -Promise.
-I hope so.
[691.12] I wanted to thank you, dear.
[694.09] -Thank me?
-You took a step for the betterment of this house.
[699.60] I didn't get you, Dad.
[702.33] Aima, you have convinced
Zoya to come back, didn't you?
[709.92] Good, I'm proud of you.
[715.09] By doing this you have again
displayed your generosity.
[721.91] You have proven how large-hearted you are.
[724.35] Otherwise if it was some other girl in your
place she would have been happy, celebrated
[731.75] that his husband's first wife has
left but you have done a great thing.
[736.47] You are a girl full of character.
[740.77] You initiated in this matter
and brought Zoya back home.
[747.68] -Dad, I did what I felt was better.
-Certainly.
[753.45] I want that you and Zoya 
accept each other sincerely.
[759.34] When you and Zoya will stay happy with
each other then Zaid will be at peace too.
[764.13] I will try my best.
[766.88] Zaid has recovered very quickly 
after his accident.
[770.34] Yeah, thank God.
[772.59] Yeah, and your care that
you did for him day and night.
[778.76] I know that Zoya is back
[781.66] but still I would like that
even after he gets better
[784.21] you shouldn't stop taking care of Zaid.
[789.74] And keep doing his tasks like you do.
[793.17] Don't take me wrong,
[795.76] I'm saying this because a
man only loves that woman,
[801.05] likes that woman who takes care of him.
[805.38] Girls these days don't even make
a cup of tea for their husbands
[808.40] and expect that they give their lives
for them. It doesn't happen this way.
[815.19] You are wise, do you get what I'm saying?
[820.17] Just keep taking care of him as a friend.
[828.88] What's wrong?
[832.70] Dad, at least he considered
me something earlier.
[838.05] He doesn't even consider me 
as his friend now.
[842.09] No, no, it's not like that.
[846.16] He got very upset when Zoya left.
[849.46] He was like that with everyone.
[853.70] Now that she is back, 
he will accept you too.
[857.10] Not only as a friend, 
but as a wife as well.
[863.98] Just give him some time, dear.
[867.76] I want nothing else from Zaid, Dad.
[872.42] It's enough for me if he
just accepts me as his friend.
[876.51] What are you saying? Is it wise 
to let go of you rights?
[883.36] Zaid is a responsible person.
He will definitely fulfill your rights.
[889.67] Yes, Dad.
[892.95] Everything is going to be fine,
dear. This is life, it keeps changing.
[902.50] Please get ma a cup of tea, 
I'm having a headache.
[1032.10] Forgive me please.
[1034.63] What are you doing, auntie?
[1039.48] You are embarrassing me.
[1041.73] And look, I have no complains with anyone.
[1048.39] I have accepted it as my fate.
[1054.33] But, honestly I tried my best 
but I couldn't fight for you.
[1062.18] It's all right, auntie. 
It was just bad timing.
[1069.07] We can't do anything about that.
[1073.76] It's your greatness
that you are saying that,
[1078.02] otherwise had it been
someone else in your place,
[1080.78]  she wouldn't even want to look at me.
[1084.62] But you guys honored me, called
me to your home, sat with me.
[1094.83] Please, auntie, it's nothing like that. 
You are still my auntie.
[1102.28] Shabana,
[1104.79] to tell you the truth 
I envy your upbringing.
[1109.49] I always said, and I say it even today,
[1114.25] she is one in a million.
[1118.31] Sister, it's not my
credit, it's God's gift.
[1124.22] No doubt, you are right.
[1177.15] Come in.
[1181.23] Where is Zaid?
[1186.39] Anything you want?
[1188.19] Yeah, I got this for him.
[1192.10] Keep it here. He is in the washroom, 
will be just back.
[1196.18] He is supposed to take his
afternoon medicine with milk.
[1201.88] evening medicine at 6:00 pm 
and then before going to bed.
[1209.68] All his medicine course is complete
[1213.11] just a few more days left for his
medicines which are very important.
[1216.79] And you can ask me anything if you want.
[1221.34] Were you giving Zaid his
medicines all these days?
[1224.30] Yeah, he is supposed to
take his medicines on time.
[1227.35] So dad gave me this responsibility,
that is why I was giving him his medicines.
[1233.67] It's okay, Aima. I am just asking. 
Why are you getting scared?
[1238.42] Okay, tell him to take his medicines. I'm
going in the kitchen, I've got some work to do.
[1250.66] How are you feeling now?
[1253.16] I'm better.
[1266.34] Aima, please tell everyone that me
and Zaid are going out for dinner tonight.
[1276.16] Okay.
[1284.14] How are you feeling now?
[1289.12] Much better.
[1301.48] Oh, where has 
the moon risen from today?
[1305.91] -Amber, I know you are
angry with me, that's why I...
[1308.64] First tell me why have you come here?
[1311.97] It's my sister's house, 
why won't I come?
[1316.11] Sister? What sister?
[1318.75] -Amber, what are you saying?
-I am telling the truth.
[1324.40] You have destroyed this relation.
[1328.70] You should consider your sister as dead.
[1332.35] For God's sake, Amber. Are you going to end
this relationship over such a small thing?
[1337.82] Small thing?
[1341.07] You have destroyed my daughter's
marriage and it is a small thing for you?
[1344.97] What's wrong, Amber, get hold of
yourself. I didn't mean it that way.
[1349.38] What did you mean then? Tell me?
[1354.86] Had it happened with
your daughter,
[1356.59] would you consider it a small
thing for you even then?
[1359.10] Amber, I didn't mean to say that. I know
that it has been really unfair with Zoya.
[1364.16] Come here, please. Sit with me.
[1368.11] I have come here to clarify all 
the misunderstanding that are between us.
[1371.61] Misunderstanding? You think getting your
son married again is a misunderstanding?
[1378.26] I mean whatever happened with Zoya is very
wrong. I have come to apologize to you.
[1385.63] Wow, you thought of it so soon.
[1389.29] You should have rested,
waited for a while and then come.
[1392.35] Amber, it has been really unfair with Zoya,
and your anger is valid.
[1397.87] But it's not right to
end relations like this.
[1400.81] And what about you? What you did was right?
[1404.21] What did I do, Amber? All this was
because of Azmat and Zaid agreed for it.
[1410.97] I got to know when they
both had gotten married.
[1415.10] What would have I done then, Amber?
[1416.75] You tell me, being my sister
did you talk to me for once even,
[1423.91] or contacted me?
[1425.68] Your daughter in law left home
and came here, but what did you do?
[1429.94] Just maneuvered things in your favor.
[1432.61] Amber, you know how Azmat is.
[1436.19] Don't you dare, don't you dare
talk about your husband to me.
[1442.38] I know very well how your husband is.
And now I know your son too how he is.
[1451.11] Right now I am just asking you
that what did you do being my sister?
[1459.46] Let me tell you what you did.
[1464.39] You supported your husband 
and your son only.
[1467.91] You didn't even care to check up 
on your sister and niece.
[1472.18] So that's why we don't have any relation,
any connection whatsoever.
[1538.24] -Greetings, Mom.
-Greetings.
[1541.81] Just great, people used to wait for us before
having tea, and now they don't even care.
[1548.81] It's nothing like that. I just had no idea
that you are getting back home directly.
[1553.57] Mom, where am I going to go if not my home?
[1556.61] You should have visited you in laws.
[1560.27] -In laws? Why?
-Because your wife has gone there.
[1568.63] Faiq, is everything all right?
[1572.86] -Didn't she tell you before leaving?
-No, Mom, I think she had called me.
[1578.66] I was so busy with the restaurant
work and then I couldn't call her back.
[1586.95] By the way, when did she leave?
[1588.97] She woke up at noon.
[1591.75] And after that she left.
[1595.90] Anyways, what's for dinner?
[1598.54] I'm really sorry, dear. I thought
you would have dinner there.
[1604.03] That's why I cooked bitter gourd for myself.
[1606.76] If you want something I can make it.
[1609.73] No, it's okay.
[1614.85] Mom, I want to talk to you about something.
[1619.49] Actually, Nosheen wants to take
over the responsibility of kitchen,
[1623.66] so I want you to give her a chance.
[1625.59] It's great if she wants to cook for you.
[1630.17] Not just for me. I mean, I want
her to take responsibility of chores.
[1635.00] I can cook my own food.
[1637.88] But if she wants to cook
anything for you then she must.
[1641.65] Mom, I want you to take a
break from kitchen chores.
[1647.21] I know how much you care about me.
[1656.21] But first ask your wife if she is willing
to take responsibility of the house or not.
[1662.33] And as far as my tasks are concerned, you
know it well that I do all my tasks myself.
[1669.81] Faiq, if you want to give her
any responsibility of the house
[1673.15] then you can do it happily.
[1676.29] -Okay I'll just go and freshen up.
-All right.
[1689.98] Amber I didn't come in front
of you out of embarrassment.
[1693.45] Really? How is your
embarrassment decreased now?
[1696.92] Has everything turned back 
like it was before?
[1698.42] Amber, what can I say?
[1702.40] Look, Amber, our kids
have reconciled as well.
[1706.17] Not our. It's just my daughter 
who has forgiven your son.
[1712.89] But I don't have such a
big heart, understand?
[1717.67] I am going to remember it all my
life how you people have treated me.
[1722.73] Don't you remember how
your daughter threatened me?
[1727.34] I know that my daughter
is very rude, Amber.
[1731.06] Rude? That is a very small word for her.
[1734.85] Your daughter is of low character.
[1738.10] Please Amber, don't say that. 
She is your niece.
[1741.68] She will be my niece if you are my sister.
[1746.47] But you aren't my sister.
[1748.89] You are just my daughter's
mother in law now.
[1753.63] And it would be better that we meet
as that relation whenever we meet.
[1759.38] Punish me as much as you want, but please,
[1764.39] don't say anything about
ending our relationship, please.
[1768.12] Look, what's done is done, and
everything is normal again now.
[1772.77] -Nothing is normal.
-What do you want then?
[1775.07] Even Zoya has accepted Aima.
[1779.04] She has gone back to your
home just because of Zaid
[1782.06] otherwise she doesn't accept this relationship at all.
[1786.44] Do you actually want that
we become sisters again?
[1790.25] -Yeah, Amber, of course.
-It's possible on one condition only
[1796.15] that you remove Aima from Zoya's way.
[1814.91] From now on, you won't go
anywhere without asking me.
[1818.60] You will go only if you have my
or mom's permission otherwise not.
[1822.68] I went to my Mama's
not to meet any boyfriend.
[1826.74] -Aima is joining office from tomorrow.
-Okay.
[1831.09] She is starting work, this means
that everything is normal at home.
[1835.63] I think you shouldn't delay
joining office anymore.
[1839.19] -You tell me how can I keep everyone happy?
-Zaid, you don't need to keep everyone happy.
[1845.95] Just keep Zoya happy.
[1849.62] Even I wanted that.
[1851.95] But it isn't possible in this situation.
