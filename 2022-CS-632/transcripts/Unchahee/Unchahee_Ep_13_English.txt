From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you Aima, were you crying? No, I wasn't. Did anybody say something to you?
Sister or Nosheen? Zaid, I am not Aima,
so behave yourself, okay? Then don't listen, go from here. I am a savage person,
I start beating up people walking by. It's not like that, Zaid. Yes, I knew about your character. But I can't support you here
because I was not aware of anything. You called him yourself.
You went to meet him at his flat as well. For all I know, you might be having
an affair with him too. Are you guys with patient Shabana Hassan? -Yes.
-How is my mother, doctor? Is everything all right? Yes, the patient is out of danger now. Thank God. What is wrong with mother, doctor? She had a major heart attack. we will have to do her angiography, so that we can find out
how many arteries are blocked? Major heart attack? How longer are you going to keep her here? We have to keep her under observation
for 2-4 days. It all depends on her condition. But how did it happen so suddenly? Your patient already had heart issues. And such patients are advised
not to take any sort of stress. We have done the tests and on its basis whatever diagnosis
we make, we will share it with you. She has taken a lot of stress about
something which has burdened her heart. Anyway, you will have to
take care of her. And she should avoid any sort
of physical activity. And take care of her diet too. And don't give her any news
which is too shocking for her. Yes we will be careful about that. When can we meet her? You can meet her. But please try not to talk much
with the patient. Meet her one by one. Okay, Aima you go. Dad, please sit down. -Thank God.
-Thank God. Thank God, you are all right now, Mother. We'll take you home very soon. You have no idea how scared I was. Tell me, Aima, is everything all right? Zaid, do one thing, take Aima home.
Freshen up and get back in the morning. I am here to take care of Shabana. -Dad, I...
-I have told you to go home. Shabana is better now,
I will take care of her. Zaid... Shabana... No, keep lying down. Brother... I am really ashamed. Don't talk too much, we will talk later.
Just relax now. You had to face so much because of us. I am worried, but not because of you
but because of your health. And I am really sorry too, Shabana, that I was not able to fulfill
the promise properly that I did to father. I wasn't able to take care of you properly. Don't say like that, brother. Only the fortunate ones
get brothers like you. I am one of those fortunate ones. You know, father said to me
in his last days that take care of your sister properly, or else I am going to hit you
with my stick on the day of judgment. I will save you that day the same way
I used to save you in childhood. Okay now don't talk too much,
the doctor has told you not to. I am going outside
or else you will keep talking. -Brother.
-Hmm? Brother, you seem really tired
to me, you should go home. Don't worry about me, I'm fine.
Just take rest. Mama, have you noticed? The mother has kept busy
dad in taking care of her there, and here my brother is busy
 in taking care of the daughter. I don't understand till when are both of
them going to exploit the men in our house. Until you are going to let them. Didn't you notice
how he went straight after Aima? It's not what you are thinking. -What is it then?
-He is doing it because of friendship only. Really? Actually Zaid likes a girl called Kinza. Really? My would-be
sister-in-law's name is Kinza? Don't be in a fool's paradise. Don't know if he actually likes her
or is it something casual. You know brother so well. And how casually you said
that it might be casual. Faisal is better than brother,
at least he is loyal with me. Oh come on, he must have had
a few other affairs. Boys these days are just like that. For your kind information,
it's nothing like that with Faisal. That loafer might not
have found anyone else. Zaid is so smart. He has so many options
when it comes to girls. Mama, don't humiliate Faisal like that.
He is your would-be son-in-law. Oh, please. As if
you are Faisal's relative. By they way, if brother has so many
options, why is he after this hideous Aima? I am telling you, if there is something
serious going on with Kinza,  Aima is going to get it stopped. I am worried about that too. Careful, take her carefully. Noorani, get all the stuff from the car. Aima, careful. Dad, I was thinking
we should talk about that... Nothing is more important for me
than Shabana's health right now. We can discuss other things later on. -Yes, Dad.
-She is not well. Stay with her all the time. Don't leave
her alone even for a single moment. Okay. I don't want her to wait for
anything even for a single moment. Thank God that she didn't need angioplasty. Yes, you are absolutely right. If you get tired
while taking care of her then tell Zaid. But don't leave her alone. Yes, Dad, don't you worry... I went to ask how your sister was doing. Yes, you should have gone. I know but your niece can't tolerate us. What do you mean? I went and sat with Shabana just for a few
minutes, and your niece asked me to leave. Why did I get unwanted  Nobody knows that Why did I get unwanted  Nobody knows that I didn't sleep at all last night. Whenever I closed my eyes
your face came in front of me. Sister, please forgive me, you all have been through
a lot of trouble because of me. Even after having a
hundred differences among us but still I wasn't able
to see you in pain. That's your greatness. You suddenly had a heart attack? You know it well, sister. Since Aima's father has passed away I am facing this problem. That's true. But I mean, did you hear such news because of which your heart
got so effected? Auntie, it's time for mother's medicine,
after which she is going to rest. So please can you come later. I just came to see how Shabana is doing. I think you didn't like my coming here. No, no, it's nothing like that, auntie. Let mother rest for a while
and then you can come back later. Okay, then, take rest, have your medicine.
I'll come back later. No, sister, please sit, it's all right. Aren't you even going to look at me now? Mother, you have full right
to be angry with me. But at least confirm it first, that the fault I am being punished for,
whether I have done it or not. I admit, I did a mistake. You should question me that Aima
have you committed a mistake or not? Aima... I wasn't even expecting a mistake from you. Why, Mother? Am I not a human? Can't I make mistakes? And you are one of those
 who forgive mistakes. Aren't you going to forgive
your daughter then? What you have done is not a mistake, at least to me it's not called a mistake. What have I done, mother? You know it very well. Mother, I didn't know
that your trust on me was so fragile that you would even believe
a whisper in the air against me. Either you don't trust
your upbringing, or my character. But you must believe me, I haven't degraded any of these things. -What was all this then, Aima?
-Mother, I just made a mistake. I have unknowingly made a mistake because
of which I am bearing the punishment. Unknowingly. How can all this happen unknowingly? Even if you don't have it, Mother, but I have completely trust
on your upbringing and my character. Whatever has happened,
someone has trapped me. There has been
a huge conspiracy against me. And as far as the mistake is concerned,
yes I have made a mistake that I didn't recognize this conspiracy. and kept getting stuck into the mire Fine. I have a feeling too
that this is a conspiracy. But the thing which I regret is that why didn't you share it with me? You know it well that I take you
more like a friend than a daughter. That's one of my mistakes too, Mother, that I became so cautious
in front of my enemies that I couldn't say anything
in front of my friends even. This allegation is raising fingers
towards you more than towards me. On your upbringing. And I can't tolerate that. I am sure, whoever has conspired against me God will unveil him one day. Mother... I know that I'm your pride. You have made a lot of
efforts while raising me. I will destroy myself but can never
destroy your pride for me. Just trust your daughter. I went to see how your sister was doing. Yes, you should have. -I know but your niece can't tolerate us.
-What do you mean? I sat with Shabana for a few minutes
only and your niece asked me to leave. Almas, for God's sake. Can you be a little considerate? You are not supposed
to complain all the time. Well, there is never a right time to
listen to our complains for you. Doctor has asked Shabana
not to talk too much. May be that's why Aima said it to you. I didn't go there to have a long discussion
with her. It was the usual small talk. What happened, when did
it happen and why, that's it. Now, please, let them rest and me as well. We are quite tired after staying up
at the hospital. Tell me, what was the bill at the hospital? It's quite an expensive hospital. Why? Why do you want to know? You must have spent a lot,
I wanted to know just like that. Must be in hundred thousands.
It's quite a huge hospital. Do you want to pay the bill? No I was just worried
because I'm your wife. That's why I was asking. Almas, just worry about the matters
that you are concerned with. Got it? It's just useless to talk to you. How could I think wrong about my daughter. Why did I listen to others? I should have trusted you my daughter. You both must be thinking that
why have I called you here right now. -Yes, Dad.
-Yes. I'm a man of principles
since the beginning. I never have compromised on my principles. NO matter if someone likes it or not. If I found anything against
my principles, I never approved of it. But now, I have started to think. Think what, Dad? I have started to think
that the world has changed a lot. Times have changed. The ways to deal with things have changed,
but my principles are as they were. Because I stand firm
over my principles, that's why I make my
decisions that way too, maybe that's why
my decision aren't liked by others. Especially your generation. It's not like that, Dad. It is like that. May be while bringing you guys up, I have made unnecessary restrictions,
I've been tough on you. Yes. But my intention always was to raise you
well and make you a good human being. I... Dad, I am satisfied with you upbringing. And I respect your principles too. I don't even have an issue
with your strictness. If this was the case,
things wouldn't have come to this point. Anyway, I have reached to a conclusion that I  am
going to keep my principles to myself only. In this age, kids want  to do
everything according to their own will, they want to make even the decisions
of their lives with full control. That's the truth, Dad. To me, this isn't right, but... if this is what is happening
in the world then be it this way. Now that I can't take decisions for you
 based on my principles, that's why I want
to give this right to you both. I... I didn't get it, Dad. The boys that you both want to get married
to, ask them to bring their proposals. I want to get you both married to them. -Where is my money?
-What money? Oh! now that your work is done
you are asking what money? -Where is the money for Aima's job?
-Lower your tone. I've told you, I will pay you
when Nosheen will give me. Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that Aima, why didn't you tell
dad everything clearly? You should have told uncle. I couldn't think of it,
I got really confused. What is this, Aima? Until you won't tell the truth how
is anyone going to know about it? I didn't expect Nosheen to be there. I thought that dad has called me
to hear the truth from me. I didn't know that dad
would say this to me. I just didn't know
how to react at that time. She is right, Zaid. Okay. Why don't you go right now and talk to him? By doing this, I would get
more suspicious in his eyes. But why? Obviously, he would think that if I was not interested in that guy,
why did I go to meet him at his flat? Now what is this? You raise
questions yourself and answer them too. Unless you tell dad, how are you
going to know what his response is? And I am going to testify for you. I know the whole truth. By the way... Zoya, I think Aima
should talk to him herself. I's wish that it doesn't come to a point
that your witness is needed. Do you see her condition? How scared she is. It is important for me to go with her. Yeah, but try to understand, Whatever she is going to say herself
would weigh more. Because dad knows
that you are her best friend and obviously you are
going to be on her side. Okay. Yes... yes, Zoya, he is right. Now, don't waste anymore time
and go talk to him. No, I can't do it right now. -Why?
-Because dad isn't home. He will be back by evening. Okay, it's final then, as soon as dad gets
back home, you are going to talk to him. And remember one thing, we are with you, okay? Really? I didn’t believe this.
What are you saying? Yes, Mama, I have listened this
from my sinful ears myself. Wow, your dad is going to melt so much, I don't believe it. He has no other option. Nosheen, I think this
is the right time, I'll talk about Hammad too,
may be He forgives him too. Mama, Please! Dad, has agreed after such difficulties
and you want to bring up a new issue. Just start preparations for my wedding. These things aren't done so quickly.
Tell that guy to send his parents first. Mom, please, stop referring him
as "that guy". His name is Faisal. What's so special in his name? God forbid, but I don't have a good
experience with boys named Faisal. Really? Did you have an affair 
with someone named Faisal? Stop it! Do you think 
your mother is like that? Oh, Mom, I was talking 
about before marriage. I mean, before you got married. There was this guy, who sent me 
an artificial ring saying it's a gold ring. His name was Faisal too. Come on! If one Faisal conned you, that doesn't mean
all the Faisals in the world are con men. I tell you, I have 
a really good experience with Faisal. Okay, okay. I was saying just like that. But this Faisal, after listening his name, my sixth sense 
is warning me this guy Faisal... Enough. You aren't a saint 
that you are getting intuitions. And please start respecting him,
he is your would-be son-in-law. Okay, okay, just hold on. 
No need to weave so many dreams, We'll do his background check first. After that your dad is
going to take a decision, okay? I am telling you nothing 
of this sort is going to happen. Dad has told me that whatever I want 
that's going to happen. As soon as Faisal
brings the proposal, we'll get engaged right
away and then married. Oh, Nosheen, I just can't believe that it has come to the point where you are expressing your
choice so openly in front of your dad  and getting married. My name is Nosheen. I do the undo-able. Anyway, tell me 
what's going to happen to Aima? She doesn't even know that guy. What will happen, Mama, 
she'll just keep crying. If she says no, then she'll be in trouble and if she says yes, where is
she going to get the guy from? Means, between the devil and the deep sea. Exactly, Mama. Besides, as far as I care, 
she should go to hell. Okay, okay, talk slowly. Or else all the plan might get spoiled. Okay, don't try to lecture me. I am your mother, and I am experienced. I know the world. If you knew the world so well, you
would have taken care of your husband. It's me who has tamed him. Nosheen, it's useless 
to argue with you. My God! -Hello, who is this?
-Oh, so that's how it's going to be now? Neither my phone is going to be answered,
nor my voice is going to be recognized? Oh, Amir, it's you. I have been calling you for so
long, why weren't you answering? I'm sorry, I was just busy with something. These excuses have gotten old, 
think of something new. Anyway, I answered your call, 
tell me what it is? -Where is my money?
-What money? Oh, now that your work is done
you are asking me what money? Where is the money for Aima's job. Lower your tone. I have told you, I'll pay you as soon
as Nosheen send me the money. It has been so many days
since I have done it, how can it be that you haven't
received the payment yet? Tell me clearly what you want to say. That you have embezzled my money. Is that what you think? 
Try to get it from me, now. Faisal, I'm telling you, 
give me my payment. Or else, what are you going to do?
Are you going to tell the police? And what are you going 
to tell the police? That I have blackmailed a girl 
and my partner has embezzled my share? Stay in your limits, got it? Means, you are not going to pay me? Yes I won't pay you, 
do whatever you can, okay? Okay. What? None of the numbers is registered? That's strange, man. Okay, listen, please keep trying. If, you know, you can track any location
or number then let me know please. Thank you. What did he get by defaming Aima? He doesn't even know Aima. Neither did he ask for any money. Then why? Why did he do 
this enmity with Aima? -Faisal, aren't you happy?
-For our marriage? No Aima's marriage. Yes, I am, I am really happy. Isn't visible through your face though. What do you mean? Are you going 
to taunt me on everything? Anyway, tell me 
when are you going to send your family? -Where?
-To my home with the proposal, you idiot. Yes, I am going to send
them soon. Very soon. How many days. Tell me the exact days. When I have told you that I am
going to send them, then I'll send them. Don't be so persistent on everything. Why are you getting angry, Faisal? Actually, I'm extremely very sorry. I am going through a bit of problems, 
that's why I get angry easily. What's wrong? Actually, I need some money. How much money? Around 1,00,000/-. A hundred thousand? Are you insane, Faisal?
I gave you a fifty thousand few days a go. If it was about 10,000-15,000,
I could have thought of something. I have to clear someone's dues. Who is it and what dues? I  don't know what do you 
keep yourself involved into, Faisal. Just tell me if you can arrange 
a hundred thousand or not? No. Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that I just want to tell you
everything honestly. I can't see you being angry. I’m not angry with you, Aima. I'm just angry with me that I was
expecting more than required from you. Don't hit me, don't hit me. -You won't do it the easy way, will you?
-I'll tell you, don't hit me. Look, I didn't do it myself. 
Someone had asked me to do it. -Stop lying!
-I am telling you seriously, -I was paid by someone to do it.
-Who paid you? There is this guy, Faisal. 
He is a very cheap man. -Faisal who?
-There is this guy. And his girlfriend asked him 
to do all this.
