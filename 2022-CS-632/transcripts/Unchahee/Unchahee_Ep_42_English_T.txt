[0.00] From flowers and from buds
[4.57] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.16] When I saw you
[14.30] I learned to chirp from you
[18.70] You were right.
[21.49] I was always wrong.
[24.61] They are never going to let me be happy.
[26.70] And Zaid is just like a puppet.
[28.00] I am not scared of your threats, nor
am I scared of your threats to hit me.
[33.70] These aren't just threats, Nosheen.
The way you are misbehaving,
[40.25] I'm afraid these threats
might turn into reality.
[43.43] Mama, I can't tell you, his mother is
nothing in compared to Faiq's cleverness.
[48.05] My fate is ruined.
Oh, God where did I get married.
[52.72] Listen madam, why are you blaming God now?
[57.23] His nature tried it's best that
you don't jump into this hell.
[60.54] But you were your own enemy.
[63.28] You always thing I am the one who is wrong.
[166.52] Greetings, Dad.
[169.51] Yeah, we have reached safely.
[172.34] No, there wasn't any issue.
[175.52] Yes, he is with me, shall
I give him the phone?
[181.53] Okay, good bye.
[189.56] It was Dad. He just wanted
to know if we are okay.
[194.27] Okay.
[204.61] Shall I get your clothes
ready for tomorrow's meeting?
[208.79] No leave it I will get them ready myself.
[247.38] -What's your problem?
-What is wrong?
[251.56] I have called you twice for lunch,
[253.68] and now I have left my lunch
and came here to call you.
[256.43] Who told you to do that? I had
told Liaqat that I don't want to eat.
[261.20] What is this? I am worrying
about you and your behaviour?
[265.48] So who told you
to worry about me?
[267.76] Right, so that you get a
chance to complain Zaid.
[273.35] That when he was away
nobody cared about you.
[276.86] I know how clever you are.
[283.31] I am taking care of you that doesn't
mean that you take it to your head.
[285.62] What is the way you are talking with me?
[289.31] Just bring peace to your life and rest.
[292.91] I have no expectations from you.
[295.05] I just don't get it.
[296.48] If we take care of you then you have
a problem, and if not even then it is a problem.
[299.70] You guys have made my life so difficult.
[303.42] I don't know who has complained to you.
[306.60] But you should stop worrying about me.
[309.63] Oh, God, Zoya. Don't you have any
regard of your and my relationship?
[313.86] You are talking so rudely.
[315.74] Excuse me auntie,
I haven't been rude to you yet.
[321.42] If you had taught your daughter so
much manners, it would have been great.
[327.71] Today, everyone would have been at peace.
[331.77] Don't you dare bring my
daughter, Nosheen, between all this.
[338.02] I won't tolerate.
[339.81] You mother and daughter
always bring Nosheen in between.
[343.06] Oh, God!
[345.41] Auntie, please leave
before I lose my temper.
[349.30] Oh, so you are going to
kick me out of my own house?
[353.42] This is my house and you
should keep that in your mind.
[358.89] Okay, fine. Stay in your house.
I am leaving.
[390.45] Zoya, you don't need to go back to
that house at all until Zaid gets back.
[394.84] Mom, my blood is boiling.
[397.10] Auntie has misbehaved with me
so much that you can't even imagine.
[401.96] I am going to bring her
back to her senses, you'll see.
[404.86] Leave it, it's no use.
[407.40] If she had any consideration, she
wouldn't have done it in the first place.
[412.52] Let her come tomorrow, I will tell her.
[415.45] She will just come and start her drama.
[417.34] We are sisters, who else do
we have other than ourselves.
[423.09] Let her come, then I am going to tell
her which blood and what relationship.
[429.98] Don't you worry about her.
[431.61] Who else should I not worry about, Mom?
[435.45] At times I feel like leaving
everything and return to my home.
[441.88] At least there was peace here.
[444.09] I had my freedom, my friends.
[449.40] After this new relationship, I am left
with nothing. Everything has changed.
[453.10] Take it easy my dear.
[455.47] No relationship is so simple.
[461.88] You'll see. You are going
through a tough time right now.
[466.98] You and Zaid are going to lead a
very good, happy life in a few days.
[470.96] Away from all these nonsensical people.
[475.73] I'm trying, Mom. But to tel you
the truth I really find all this too difficult.
[480.36] I just feel like that
this torture should end.
[484.00] My dear. Everything is going
to be fine, just have courage.
[497.63] -Here's your file.
-Thank you.
[503.07] Okay listen, it's too late.
Why don't you rest.
[508.38] What about you?
[510.54] I have some work to do. I'll manage.
[517.41] Aima.
[522.91] I'm sorry.
[526.44] I have an idea how much
I have hurt you since past few days.
[532.15] It's okay. doesn't matter.
[545.41] I really need you in my life.
[550.52] I know.
[556.11] Please, just rest.
[570.89] Please, just stop fighting, you two.
[573.63] -We are not fighting.
-So, are you expressing love like this?
[580.44] Aima got it.
[582.65] Actually, the love between
Zoya and me is just like that.
[587.82] I knew it. Truth has come
out of your mouth eventually.
[593.62] What can I do, I couldn't wait any longer.
[597.73] Anyway, if you have fallen in
love with me then I don't mind.
[604.27] Please. Zoya, it's time that you
confess too how much you love me.
[645.46] Zaid, Zaid!
[649.78] Zaid, Zoya's calling.
[656.08] Hello.
[658.38] Zoya, what happened? Are you all right?
[661.02] -Yeah, I'm fine.
-Why are you crying?
[665.54] I was just feeling worried.
[667.67] -Listen, is everything okay?
-I have seen a really bad dream, Zaid.
[672.00] Are you all right?
[674.92] No, relax I'm perfectly fine.
Calm down relax. Everything is fine here.
[712.31] I'm relieved, finally!
[714.76] Me too. Let's tell dad about it.
[717.55] No, no, don't tell dad right now.
The final decision still has to be taken.
[723.89] You will raise his
expectations for no reason.
[726.98] Just wait, you never know
what happens at last moment.
[729.88] You are right.
[732.18] But it's night that our first
step has been very successful.
[738.88] -What's wrong?
-Nothing.
[742.47] Okay then I am going to order tea.
[746.91] By the way, listen, where
shall we have dinner tonight.
[751.27] In fact, there is a very nice restaurant
nearby, Shavez has praised their food a lot.
[756.80] -What's wrong? Aren't you hungry?
-No.
[760.44] But you had so little
even there too, I saw you.
[763.03] Yeah, actually I didn't feel like it.
[766.58] Okay then we are going out in an hour.
We'll have good food and have a good time.
[770.97] -You should change.
-Why? aren't these clothes all right?
[774.93] No, they are fine too.
I meant if you wanted to get fresh.
[778.52] -Okay.
-Okay?
[790.31] Okay then, be ready.
We'll go together for shopping tomorrow.
[793.84] Zaid there is no need. I have so
many clothes, I can wear any of them.
[798.29] "Zaid there is no need", what do you
mean are you going to wear old clothes?
[801.04] By old clothes, I don't mean
that I am going to wear rags.
[807.66] You don't worry, whatever
I am going to wear, I will look good.
[811.39] Just leave it, and keep quiet. And you are
coming with me for shopping in the morning.
[816.12] Zaid, I have told you, I don't need any.
[819.21] Okay then come with me
to get auntie's dress then.
[824.70] Zaid did you talk to Nosheen?
[841.46] Yeah, oh yes, no issues.
[846.07] Just book it,
no matter how expensive it is.
[851.27] Yeah, okay, I'll get
your payment transferred.
[864.45] Okay.
[867.12] Good morning.
[870.54] What's wrong?
Didn't you sleep well last night?
[873.97] No, I slept very late last night.
[877.22] Yeah, I can see that.
[881.32] Come on, Zoya, you don't look
nice being so dull. Stay a little fresh.
[887.89] I don't feel like it, Mom.
[893.60] -Besides, there should be a reason to get ready.
-Zoya, you are saying it of all people?
[898.96] Since when do you need an occasion
to get ready or an excuse to stay happy?
[907.38] Tell me, did that company from
Dubai gave you any offer again?
[914.52] -They contacted me twice.
-Then?
[921.88] I was so caught up then
that I didn't respond them.
[925.46] But why, Zoya?
[927.42] Isn't it your passion? 
Why aren't you following it then?
[930.81] It was my passion, 
but I don't feel like it any more.
[934.64] Zoya, getting married doesn't mean
that one just stops caring about oneself.
[942.97] And I can't see you like this.
[947.14] Please, I want my old Zoya back.
[952.54] Zoya.
[956.70] Zoya, my dear, nobody's life is easy.
[964.08] You have to make it easy.
[967.09] And I want you to
continue with your passion.
[973.21] Once you get back from your honeymoon,
then continue with your modeling again.
[980.33] Mom, you were always against my career.
[984.51] What is it with you now?
[988.09] I think that you need it right now.
[996.19] You will be so lonely 
when I'm going to get married.
[998.74] So you should get married too 
right after me.
[1003.31] Right now you tell me, 
when are you getting married?
[1008.81] In around 4-5 years.
[1011.82] 4-5 years? Really?
[1014.52] Mom, I'm kidding. I will get married,
I just wanted to see your reaction.
[1025.34] On a serious note, 
when I will leave tomorrow,
[1030.27] then you are going to be so lonely.
[1033.68] So what are you going to do then?
[1035.70] The same, I will take care of my
home and my business, what else?
[1039.93] But still, I won't be there with you.
[1043.31] You must feel so lonely.
[1059.62] Aima, how long will you take?
[1062.79] Just five more minutes, Zaid.
[1065.88] What?
[1068.06] I said, just five minutes.
[1089.71] Show me.
[1101.97] It's supposed to be closed like this, okay.
[1105.63] Nice watch, come, come on hurry up.
[1108.34] Get up.
[1110.17] Yeah.
[1127.13] Are you done talking?
[1130.32] What's your problem.
[1131.89] If we sister and brother talk to each
other, what's your issue with it?
[1135.81] Why would I have a problem.
[1137.72] Go ahead finish talking if there
is still something left to talk about.
[1141.12] Whatever you want to
talk about say it clearly.
[1143.64] Don't you always 
talk this nonsense with me.
[1146.50] Everything I do or say 
seems nonsense to you.
[1149.41] God has given all the wisdom 
to you brother and sister.
[1151.99] That's the reason I don't want to talk to
you that you are always ready to taunt me.
[1158.16] Why shouldn't I? Can't you see?
[1160.71] -What's wrong?
-Faiq and his mother are torturing Nosheen.
[1165.26] So?
[1167.63] What do you mean by so? Nosheen is our
daughter, how can be someone so bad to her?
[1173.18] He is her husband and she is her
mother in law, let her deal with them.
[1176.56] -What can I do in this regard?
-Why not?
[1182.59] This is why girls' in
laws make their lives hell
[1185.98] because they don't get any
support from their families.
[1188.75] Not at all.
[1190.47] Girls ruin their lives themselves. 
I have seen it.
[1195.88] I have seen how girls don't forgive
anything when they go to their in laws,
[1200.61] like they used to do in their own home.
[1204.49] The truth is that they never accept
their in laws as their own family.
[1209.17] That's why they dislike everything
that is said by their in laws.
[1213.62] It's just how you think it is
but doesn't necessarily be true.
[1216.39] I also think that the girls who
have complains with their in laws
[1219.51] that they don't treat them well,
[1223.23] they should re-assess
their own character first.
[1226.36] If you are done with your lecture
then I wanted to ask you something,
[1229.98] that I wanted to gift Faiq and Nosheen
a world tour honeymoon package.
[1234.81] Oh, so your daughter wants to go too
just because Zaid and Zoya are going?
[1239.70] Yeah, so what's wrong with that?
They are newly married as well.
[1244.18] Look if you keep supporting Nosheen
every time when she is being stubborn
[1248.26] then I don't think her
marriage could go on.
[1250.68] God forbid, what are you saying, Azmat?
[1253.68] All I wanted was to tell you that maybe
this way her marriage can be secured.
[1261.42] I'm sleepy.
[1264.10] Switch off the lights.
[1273.46] The food was so good.
[1275.33] -Yeah.
-I told you to try the steak, it was really nice.
[1282.56] -Yeah, so.
-Why aren't you answering your phone?
[1289.25] Is it Zoya?
[1294.44] I think you should talk to her.
[1302.12] Hello.
[1308.45] Zaid, where are you? 
I've been calling you for so long.
[1312.40] I went to have dinner at a restaurant.
[1314.77] What? With whom?
[1317.21] -What kind of a question is this, Zoya?
-What kind of answer is it?
[1320.33] Answer about what has been asked to you.
[1322.11] And don't ask question
over a question to me.
[1324.80] What is the way you are talking to me?
[1327.81] Whatever I am doing with
you right now, Zaid, is very less.
[1331.68] -Listen, Zoya, can yo please behave?
-Shut up, Zaid.
[1335.76] You shut up man, what's wrong with you?
[1347.40] I can't believe, 
Dad still doesn't believe Aima?
[1350.71] Moreover, he has refused
to listen to your witness too.
[1354.86] Zaid, you were right to stop me.
[1358.43] If uncle had said all those things in
front of me, I would have felt really bad.
[1365.64] I just don't understand why is
dad even considering Aima a liar?
[1370.24] Specially when you are ready 
to testify in her favor.
[1376.56] The reason is quite simple. 
Uncle doesn't like me.
[1380.47] I have always noticed it.
[1383.13] Zoya, why would dad dislike you?
[1387.02] I have always felt that, and every
person has his own likes and dislikes.
[1393.77] Look, this might be your
misunderstanding too.
[1396.41] It's not a misunderstanding, 
I mean I have seen him avoiding me.
[1400.61] But anyways, right now it's
Aima's matter right now, not mine.
[1404.48] So I am just concerned that till
when is she going to stay at home
[1409.66] and what will happen to her studies?
[1411.85] Stupid, this means that she isn't that
important for him as much as we thought.
[1420.47] I mean she isn't even close to our level.
[1425.00] -But why did you do so?
-Idiot, because of you.
[1430.98] Because of me?
[1432.61] Yeah, because your issues were
going on so his temper was loose.
[1438.19] And even if I had said something to him at
that time then he would have scolded me too.
[1450.27] What's wrong?
[1453.92] -Nothing.
-So what was I saying?
[1455.46] Yeah, steak. Next time you have to try
the steak, even Shavez was praising it.
[1488.76] -Aima, there is a problem.
-What happened?
[1492.17] -The meeting has been canceled.
-But why?
[1496.27] Mr. Mirza's mother has passed away.
[1500.51] So he has given his employs off 
for two days.
[1503.21] Now the meeting will be on Monday.
[1505.06] But have our flight booked 
for tomorrow night.
[1509.32] So, what are we going to do now?
[1512.76] Honestly, I have no idea. 
I don't know what to do.
[1517.91] If we cancel this meeting
and go back tonight then
[1523.89] all our efforts will be wasted 
and dad is going to get hurt too.
[1530.39] Yeah, but if we don't go back, your
and Zoya's plan will be disturbed again.
[1533.36] No, that's not an issue, 
auntie has postponed the trip.
[1539.19] If we attend Monday's
meeting and then go back in the evening
[1542.14] to stay at home can still catch
a late night flight for my trip.
[1547.10] So, what are we going to do now?
[1549.33] We will have to cancel our flight,
we don't have any other option.
[1555.02] Okay then call Zoya.
[1558.27] I'm not calling her, Aima.
[1560.16] Again you are being stubborn. Why do
you guys start fighting over petty issues?
[1564.86] This isn't a petty issue, Aima. You
know how she misbehaved with me today.
[1568.95] And then she hung up on me.
[1571.01] You know this is how she
reacts when she is angry.
[1574.28] What kind of anger is this?
[1575.97] I am not her slave that I should be alert
all then time that Zoya may call any minute.
[1579.51] Look, Zaid, what's done is done.
[1582.20] Don't prolong it.
[1586.80] She must be already very disturbed
because her plans were canceled.
[1590.26] And now she has had a fight with you too.
[1592.42] I know very well that she
must be really upset right now.
[1595.68] Whatever, Aima, I am not calling her again.
[1597.66] She should know that she is not
supposed to talk to me in this tone.
[1600.89] -Zaid, please call her.
-Please, Aima, don't force me.
[1621.78] Mom, do you have my phone?
[1625.20] Yes, I brought it here 
so that you don't wake up.
[1629.65] Did Zaid call?
[1632.45] No, I didn't get any call.
[1638.83] What's wrong? Why did you two fight?
[1643.22] No, nothing. Nothing happened.
[1646.96] If nothing has happened, why have
you hurt yourself on the hand then?
[1652.31] No, nothing, we didn't have any fight.
[1657.13] What is it, Zoya? 
What are you thinking about?
[1664.14] Mom, I can't share Zaid with anybody.
[1670.62] I don't want Aima in his life.
[1674.89] I tried to explain this to you 
a lot earlier.
[1679.21] But you didn't get that you won't be
able to tolerate this relationship at all.
[1683.55] But you insisted.
[1687.51] Mom, there is no use 
to argue over what has been done.
[1690.45] And besides I am really frustrated.
[1693.83] I just want a solution to this problem.
[1698.70] Then there is just one solution 
to this problem.
[1727.55] Hello.
[1741.82] Hello?
[1743.85] Who is this? Why don't
you talk if you are calling?
[1746.95] You must have a lot
of free time but I don't.
[1750.27] If you call again then I am going
to give your number to my husband,
[1753.86] he is going to talk to you then.
[1759.17] Don't know what kind of a looser does such things.
[1770.79] You won't give up like that. I am going to
give your number to cyber crime right now.
[1775.01] Nosheen.
[1777.12] -Who is this?
-Faisal here.
[1785.36] That's the reason we
had to postpone our flight.
[1789.73] No problem, dear. It's good 
as much as you both can enjoy together.
[1794.84] Aima, are you happy dear?
[1799.13] Yes, a lot.
[1801.03] Zoya, Zaid's flight must have landed.
[1811.41] What time was his flight?
[1814.78] It must have landed at 7 o'clock.
[1818.23] but it's 10:30 now.
[1821.27] He should have come by now to pick you up.
[1823.95] -Listen, Nosheen.
-What now?
[1828.53] Actually?
[1830.82] can you lend me some money?
