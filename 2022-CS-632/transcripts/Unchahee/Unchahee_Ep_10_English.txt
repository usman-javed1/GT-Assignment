From flowers and from buds I have learnt to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you I have an idea that Almas and Nosheen
have adopted an unfair behaviour with you. Is that true? Your dear aunt, poisons
your dad's ears against me. No, no, I haven't talked 
to brother about it at all. If you hadn't said anything, Azmat wouldn't have rebuked me
so much without any reason. The world might feel pity
on your miserable face. But don't you dare show your
cunningness in front of me. Come , come in. Relax, no issues. Come in. -Aima, I'm telling you...
-Stay where you are. Stay there. Don't you dare come near me, or else... Look, I am not going to harm you at all,
you don't need to worry, just relax. Just give me my data, I've got no time. I will give it to you, 
first come inside the room. Don't you dare...
whatever you need to say, say it here. -Dude, you...
-I ain't your dude! Look, this is my friend's place 
and it is empty most of the times. If the neighbors listen to us they
will get suspicious for no reason. That's not my problem. Get me my pictures right now. Aima, you are completely safe here. Give me my pictures
 and leave me alone then. All right, wait. What are you doing? Put it back. Put it back. -Have some water.
-I don't want to, move... What did you do? I said I
don't want to drink water! Move away. Don't you dare touch me,
scoundrel, shameless guy! I was just helping you. I don't want your help. 
Don't you dare touch me. Bring my pictures, and all the data that you have,
bring it to me, let me leave then. Look, Aima, I can't make you understand
anything standing like this.  Please, sit down. Okay, as you wish. Don't you have any manners? -Oh, sorry I forgot to ask. 
-Move it away, I am allergic to smoke. Okay, there you go, happy? You... tell me honestly,
 who has asked you to do all this? And from where did you get 
all these pictures of me? Aima, all the pictures that I have 
of yours are edited by me. All of them are fake, edited. Besides, I am not going 
to send your pictures to anyone. I don't have the contact 
of any of your family member. Delete them in front of me. Right now. I am telling you 
that I am going to delete them. You did as I said,
now I'll do as you say. I said, delete all the pictures
in front of me right now. Okay. Here, delete them yourself. Go ahead. Delete them. And yes, delete the
pictures from "deleted items" too  or else they will remain there. Take your time, no worries. All done? Happy now? It was just that. Look, Aima, I called you here just because
I can say what I wanted to say to you. I love you, Aima. Honor less man. If you'll even try to contact me again, then I am going to involve the police.
Understood? Cheapster. Hey, listen, Aima, Aima! At least you could have listened to me. One has to do all sorts of
things for money. Let's go. Oh, God! You went alone? Talk slowly, someone might listen. I didn't know what to do, Zoya,
that's why I went alone. And those pictures? Everything was fake, he told me himself
that he edited those pictures. What was the point of doing all this then? Trapping girls by telling
them he loves them. He was saying that he loves me, 
I slapped him real hard after that. I don't get it. Why would someone
do like this if he is in love? Just forget it now. 
I don't want to discuss it anymore. We won't talk about this issue again. Not yet, first Zaid is
going to investigate you, where did you go, why did you
go, with whom did you go? You know how sentimental he is. I know you guys 
are hiding something from me. I am observing everything, 
fine don't tell me anything. I just don't get what Zaid's problem is. Where ever I go I should tell this mister.
As if he is my father. But my mind is stuck on
just one thing that... He didn't do anything to you, did he? He was trying to, and he was finding
excuses to get closer to me. That's why I slapped him. But you shouldn't have
gone there all alone. -I know.
-Anyway, you know, Zaid has got gifts
for Kinza worth 20,000/- He only stopped when I asked him to. He is just in a relationship now, if they get committed, I don't know
what that girl would do to him. Thank God he didn't transfer 
the house and his car etc. in her name. I find her quite ordinary. Aima, -why don't you say anything?
-What can I say, Zoya? If Zaid likes her then she must
be extra-ordinary for him. You and your philosophies. Yes, Mama? Yes, I'll be back in a while. Fine, okay, bye. Thank you, thanks a lot. Zoya, you didn't greet your uncle. Oh, hello, I'm so sorry. -How are you, uncle?
-Fine, thank you. How are you doing, and how are studies? It's fine, but not like Aima. Why is that? Sorry, were you asking something?
I got distracted by this message. I was asking that... Hello? Yes, I'm on my way. Shall I send it when I reach home? Okay. Sorry, guys, I have to go.
 I have some work to do, okay? So, I'll see you soon. Okay, bye. There is something 
that I have noticed about Zoya. And what is that? She has the same carelessness and
thoughtlessness like Nosheen,  which is dislike so much. You have never liked any girl other than... You just start fighting without reason. Try to understand what I am saying. You should have asked the
reason why I am saying it. The reason is quite clear. You have an objection on everyone
who is associated with me. I am not saying anything to Zoya. I am just saying 
that her habits don't suit her. Girls from good families 
don't behave this way. And what are the qualities that suit 
on girls from good families? Poise, respect of elders, consideration.
Our traditional ways. And unfortunately, 
girls these days have none of it. Why don't you say it clearly that you
want every girl to be like Aima, right? And this poise, consideration, politeness, that is just for you by your dear one. Your dear one doesn't consider us at all, 
misbehaves so much with me. You are taking to to another direction,  I was just saying that I don't
like Zoya's habits. Zoya is someone else's daughter,
You don't even like Nosheen. Every person has some
qualities and some drawbacks. Some are full of pretense. They are something else from inside
and something else from outside, and some are like Nosheen
and Zoya, straight forward. Put some sugar in your tea, 
your tone might get a bit sweet. Show me the positive changes
in you through your actions, not just with words. The day you behave actually
like your sisters with Aima, and give Shabana the respect 
that she deserves, you won't have 
to tell me anything that day. Why did I get unwanted Nobody knows that Why did I get unwanted Nobody knows that -Aima.
-Yes, Mother? Aima what is this, where were you gone?
You didn't even tell me. Mother, I told you, I went
for something important. No matter how important it might be, always tell me the details before leaving. Where are you going and with
whom, and when will you return. -You know, Zaid was also worried.
-I'm really sorry. I am going to tell you
next time, happy now? Aima, you made a huge mistake
the other day as well. Complaining about sister,
and Nosheen to brother. What should have I done? Dad was asking me. Yes, he shouldn't have asked it
 if you hadn't talked to Zaid about it. Mother, Zaid and dad should also know 
how their behaviour is with us both? Complaining to brother 
about it isn't the solution to this. If the matter of this house
could be solved this way,  they would have been solved long ago. You don't know, things would get 
even worse this way. By doing that, sister and Nosheen
won't start liking us, would they? Yes, Mother, I made a mistake. I even told Zaid not to tell. Anyway... Besides, dear, we must acknowledge that by keeping us in their house
they have indebted us. No matter how much brother
and Zaid deny it, but that is the truth. And their love for us
can't hide this truth. Yes, Mother, you are absolutely right. Dear, these complains will have
 a bad effect on brother and Zaid. No matter what, sister and Nosheen have
a much closer relationship with them. I don't want that brother doesn't spend
quality time with his family because of us. And Zaid too. I just want that brother thinks good of sister and Nosheen. Yes, Mother. -May I say something?
-Yes? I just don't believe how in the world
can a person can be so positive? But I am proud that
 that positive person is my mother. May God always keeps you happy. Dear, you are my happiness only. 
If you are happy then I am happy. Yes, Mother. I won't let
you complain again. I know that very well. You are not the one
who repeats her mistakes. Dear... as many days you have in this house, spend them with patience.
Tolerate and forgive. God willing, one day God will make a very good, 
a much better arrangement for you. Mother, I always worry about what is going to happen to you
when I go away from this house. Oh... what is going to happened to me, huh? I will keep spending my life 
as I am spending it. Besides, I don't want
anything else from life now. I just want your happiness 
and your peace, dear. Dad, I have made a cake, try it please. That's great. You know I avoid sugar. Dad, it's sugar-free. 
I have made it specially for you. You have made it, it's fine.
Even if it wasn't sugar free I would have eaten it because
my daughter has made it. It's delicious. Thank God, you liked it. 
Hard work pays off. Dad, my I share a problem with you? Dad, mother gave me your message. And I try my best that I take care of Aima. But, Dad, Aima has an issue even over this
that why am I being so thoughtful for her. You both have been raised in front
of me, under the same roof. I know both of you very
well, you know your nature? I haven't spent this life just like that. I didn't get what you said, Dad. Make me realize the positive changes
in you through your actions. Not just with words. The day your behaviour with Aima
is actually like your sisters, and give Shabana the respect
 that she deserves, you won't have 
to tell me anything that day. I am actually going to be
really happy with you. Okay, Dad, I will agree to this too. Because anything I say, 
you don't find it true. Nor you trust me, and how can you
trust, I have lost it myself. But, Dad, you over estimate Aima. I don't get it, what is your point? Just that, Dad, that you
can see my faults only, not Aima's. The mistake I did, Aima could
have done it too, Dad. I know Aima, she would never
do anything like that. Dad, thats very normal these days, and I am not saying that in a wrong
way, the society is like that. Parties etc. are very normal, and Aima must be going to such parties too. She wouldn't stay in the university
 all the time with brother around. -What are you trying to say?
-Just that, Dad, that it's quite normal for a girl and a boy
to be friends with each other nowadays. And I made a mistake which you got to see. I have a better idea than you, I know, 
I have seen the world, that what is happening and what's not. If something bad becomes a norm, that doesn't mean that it is
turned to something good. If everyone is jumping into a well, 
would you also jump? No, Dad, you are right. I hope you are going to think about it. Okay, ask your mother to get my brown suit
ready, I have to goto a meeting. -Okay, Dad.
-Okay, and listen... the cake was really good. -Thank you , Dad.
-Welcome. What happened? Dad? Dad are you okay? Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that -Would you like to tell where you were?
-No. Really, so it has come to this point? I don't want to talk to you. Oh, wow, the thief scolds the police. What's up with you, Aima? Since past few days, we have noticed
that you have been behaving weirdly. Means, you don't take interest 
in anything I say. And you go to the university by yourself
too. I mean what's going on? What's wrong? Zaid I told you, I don't want to
talk to you, go away from here. May I know why? When I told you not to discuss it, 
why did you do it then? -Discuss what?
-The one with auntie and Nosheen. Oh, that. So what? -Don't you know what could have happened?
-I just told it to dad. Whatever, it was mine and mother's matter. If I shared something
with you to unburden myself, that didn't mean at all
 that you tell it to everyone. Aima, I think you are forgetting that
you and me live in the same house. All your problems are my problem. And what did you expect, that you are
going to share your problem with me and I'd keep saying 
all is well, all is well? And you know me that I can't stand
seeing anyone getting oppressed. Whatever it was, 
you shouldn't have discussed it. On one hand there is dad. He is after me that I don't take
interest in domestic issues and now if I am taking interest
and pointing out issues then you have a problem,
what should I do then? Look, do the things 
with which you are concerned. Don't interfere in my matters. Really? Means I don't have 
any concern with your issues now? Why do you get after one thing. I think you are worried
about something else, and you are taking your anger
out over this thing. Anyway, I get it. I can guess by your tone that you just
don't want to talk to me, I understand. Oh, what is wrong with me? Was everyone at home? Yes, everyone was there, 
and you know, I met uncle too, today. Was he in a good mood? Seemed okay to me, but... But what? Mom, I think auntie isn't
comfortable living with him. That's because  brother Azmat
 is quite dominating. He doesn't let anyone have a say
 in front of him. I would never spend my life 
with such a man. Sometimes you say 
that you don't want a puppet. And now you don't want someone dominating. Mom, you are talking about two extremes. I mean, there is a thing
called understanding. It's not necessary that there is a puppet
or a dominating person among partners. Can't married couples live like friends? In your age, everyone talks like that. But the reality is any one
of them has to compromise. Hey, Mom, I don't believe in this. Okay, I agree that it is really important to be friends
and have understanding with each other. but a certain environment 
for that is required. God! I knew you would say that. 
Don't you get tired? Okay, show me the guys and I'll meet them. Right so that you choose
them again to reject them. I don't have a factory of guys, that I keep you showing them one after
other and you keep rejecting them. I don't like any of them, what should I do? I just don't get you. Mama, where are you going? I was thinking of
going on shopping. -Don't go.
-Why? I am telling you don't go
or else you'll regret. Nosheen, what am I going to regret? Mother, my heart says that we are
going to get some good news. Nosheen, whenever your heart says
something, you are proven wrong. Okay, listen, I am going for shopping,
 you should come along. Don't know how long has it been 
that you haven't gone out. I'm not interested in roaming around
 like crazy people in malls. Oh, so in your point of view am I crazy? No, no, Mama, I'm just asking you not
to go today. You can go tomorrow. Nosheen why are you being
persistent like small children? Try to understand, I swear we are
going to get some good news today. What is wrong? Look at me. What's wrong? Tell me clearly what is 
the drama behind this story? Nothing. Something is fishy, 
I can guess by your style. -Dad, did you call me?
-Yes, dear, come sit. -How are you?
-I am fine. Zaid was telling me that in a few days
your university is going to be over. Yes, Dad, just a little time is left. So, what are your plans for future? You mean about work? As soon as my studies are over,
I will apply at a few places. And from wherever I get 
a call, I will join there. What if I ask you to join me
after getting done with studies, then? No pressure. It all depends upon you. Dad, that is something to be proud
of that you consider me worthy of it. That's great. I am happy to know that. I would be glad if you'd join my team. Okay tell me, did you make some juice
the other day which Nosheen drank? Yes, Dad. I made it for mother. What happened then? She came in the kitchen and without
asking me she picked it up and drank it. Look, dear, try to forgive
these petty things. You waste your time in such petty issues. If you want that peace is maintained
in this house, things stay in order then you have to make room
 in your heart, broaden it. Just don't mind it. 
Do you understand why I'm saying? Yes, Dad. Even if she did drink the juice, you could have made some more,
everything was there in the house. Just remember that when
both parties move forward only then the distances
between each other can be reduced. Yes, Dad. I won't let you complain again. Bless you. Now make me a glass of juice
so that I see how you make it. I'll get it right away. What is wrong? 
Why haven't you done it till now? So when will you do it? Is everything done? If you have received them after edit, 
what are you waiting for then? I am not going to run away 
with your payment. Okay, I'm transferring it right now, 
do it right away. Yeah, okay. Your mother didn't come? Actually she wasn't feeling well so I gave
her dinner and then asked her to sleep. Okay, nice. Yes, Dad. Almas, get my clothes ready, I have 
to go somewhere important after dinner. Okay. Why don't you check it, 
you are getting so many messages. I'm not having an affair. What happened? Dad? Dad are you okay? Dad? Aima, water, get some water. I think... are you getting a heart attack? Dad? Dad, have some water.
Dad... Wat... I'm fine. I'm okay. Nosheen, call the doctor! Dad... Listen, is everything all right? I am really worried, you left dinner too. Everything is fine. Leave me alone. You had to go meet someone, 
what about that? I will go. I will do something, 
don't worry about that. How can I not worry. 
I am not insensitive like others. You can tell me and get
it off your chest. Till when are you going
to keep it to yourself?  One can ease the burden with sharing. Dad, you forgot your phone there,
I thought I should return it. -Dad, you don't seem okay.
-I am perfectly fine. -Should I get some juice for you, Dad?
-No, no need for that. Do you need anything else then? 
Should I get that? I want to stay alone for a while. But , Dad you aren't well. I said, I'm fine. Now go from here. Almas, you go as well. Leave me alone for a while. Aima, Dad isn't angry with you. It must be something between elders
that's why he sent you away from there. Zaid, I am getting anxiety attacks. It seem
like my soul is being drained from my body. I just don't understand,
why are you so tensed? You getting worried
doesn't make sense. If Dad has gone to talk
to auntie, this means it's not business related,
it's about something at home, But, but what is it? May be, brother Hammad
tried to contact him. Or it can be something related to Nosheen. There is no way that it's related to you, 
so please calm down. Zaid... Aima? Look at yourself, 
you seem scared to death, sit here. Sit down, wait a second,
let me get some water. Zaid I'm really sorry,
I should have told you earlier. What sorry, what are you mumbling?
Have some water. Wait a second. Hello? Yes, greetings, uncle Sharafat. 
How are you doing? Yes, I think Dad was
talking about a meeting. But he is at home today. Yes, he was a little unwell, so... Yes, hold on, I'll let
him talk to you. yes. What happened so suddenly, 
that Dad got so worried? What if any picture of mine... Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that. Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that. What news did he get through messages
due to which he got so worried? You know, he doesn't talk 
to anyone when he is worried. He sent Mama and Nosheen
out of his room too. He has asked me that... whatever proposals Aima has got, consider
them and whichever seems suitable, get Aima married as soon as possible. Do you remember, Dad? When you left your phone,
 I brought it back to you. I have seen everything, Dad. 
And I know why you are worried.
