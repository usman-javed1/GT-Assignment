From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you It had no effect on his father. He is still being stubborn,
but I won't spare him either. -I'll show him.
-What? What can you do, Mom? Aima, at least someone needs to talk. Look, it's not just him who got effected you have been effected
with brother's decision too. A huge gap has been created
between us after this incident. I think that we should stay
away from each other for a while. Aima is banking on me, you
have expectations from me too. Auntie's health is dependent
on me, but what about me? Does anybody care about me? You want me to be happy
and smile and accept everything as if nothing had happened? - Zoya.
- Why are you standing? Sit down. Thank you. So, how is your and Zaid's life going on? The way that you can't even imagine. Obviously. Si, there must be no
hurdle for you both now. You both must be very
happy with your lives. By the way why are you here?
To invite me for you valima? Why are you saying all this, Zoya? Why would I hurt you? You're my friend. Enough, Aima. I'm your
friend, why would I hurt you? Don't you get tired of saying all that? Say whatever you want and then leave. Zoya, I haven't come here
to talk to you about myself. I'm here to talk to you about Zaid. What's the difference? You talk about
yourself or Zaid, it's the same thing. Zaid has met an accident., Zoya. So? He is badly injured. He needs you. He doesn't need me but the doctor. He'll get better if he gets
treatment from a good place. Then you both can live happily together. Zoya, what you are thinking isn't right. His happiness has left
since you have left him. Zoya, he is in a really bad shape. Apparently he has many injuries
but from within he is broken. He needs you to stay alive,
he needs your presence. Aima, you know what?
Just leave all this right now because it won't effect me any more. Please , Zoya, he loves you
so much, he is going to die. Nobody dies without anyone. He is punishing himself. Wow. Committing a crime himself and
then punishing himself too, just great. I just don't believe it. Okay, fine, just come with me
and see his condition. Aima, what's done is done. And it' better to live your lives happily
together, what do you have to do with me? What life, Zoya?
Which life are you talking about? A life where he makes me realise
everyday that I mean nothing to him. He doesn't let me close to him
even as a friend let alone like a wife. He doesn't talk to me, he
doesn't even want to look at me. What you have imagined is wrong. Relationships aren't made
just by signing a paper. There is no relation between me and Zaid. There is an agreement between me and him. An agreement which
we both were compelled to make. Believe me. If it weren't for my mother
I would never have done all this. I would have accepted
what was written in my fate. Aima, you are legally his wife . And knowing this fact it is
really difficult for me to accept it. You know what I mean. Zoya, it doesn't matter to
him if I am in his life or not. It's only you who is important for him. He loves you. Please don't do this to him. Save you relationship. Because if anything happens to Zaid
I will never be able to forgive myself. You know what, Aima? You are legally his wife and
knowing that you are a part of his life, I can't tolerate that,
nor can I ever will. Okay, fine. I will not use any of my
rights even after being Zaid's wife. I promise you that. Please, just let me... let me live in your house. I will remain in your life and your
house like some old thing lying around. Please. Zaid is just yours and he will
remains yours I promise you that. Please, say yes, Zoya. I'm really sorry, Zoya. For what? Look, Zaid, it's not your fault, okay? Stop blaming yourself. And besides if you are going to lose
hope, who is going to take care of Aima? She depends on us so much. I will have to support Aima, Zoya. That's what I'm saying, that
only you have to support her. I know. That's why I'll have to marry her. I'm filing a case on Zaid. He is going to come back to his senses
after spending some time in the lock up. What case? Well, he has given you
mental torture right after and married again without your consent. -Put all the vegetables away carefully.
-Greetings, Mom. -Greetings.
-Faiq was telling me that you went for groceries. I would have helped you had I been home. I would have gone with you. Nosheen, I always go for groceries alone. Anyway, I came to know that Zaid
had an accident, how is he doing now? What can I say, Mom? He is in a bad shape since few days. Few days? But he had
an accident just today. That's due to so much stress.
Otherwise my brother drives very safely. Stress? What kind of stress? Obviously, Dad has burdened him
more than he could handle. What are you saying? What kind of burden? - Actually, Mom, I was talking about Aima...
- My niece isn't a burden on anyone. In fact she is a blessing
in your brother's life. - Yeah I was just...
- Nosheen, I'm still talking. The girl whom you are calling a burden, she is going to make
your mother's house a heaven. Only if you people are going to value her. Mom, I know that Aima
has got qualities, it just slipped out of my mouth
because I am a bit worried. Yeah, sure, it's obvious how much
you are worried about your brother. Tell your family to value Aima. Those who don't regret it later. And no one knows it better than me. Old woman, Aima's flatterer. Where is Aima? She has gone to Zaid,
to give him breakfast. That's nice, she should take care of Zaid. Shabana, these relationships
are very fragile. Just like an innocent bird. If you hold them with force,
they die in your hands. If you hold them loosely, they fly away. You have to take care
of them with loving hands. Only then they work. Yes. Yeah, it's okay. You seem a lot better now. I don't feel like it though. You'll feel it with passage of time. Here, have your breakfast then
you have to take your medicine too. Zoya, you're back! Why? Don't you like it that I'm back? No, it's nothing like that.
In fact I'm really happy to see you. You are serving Zaid
with a lot of devotion. Yeah, he wasn't able to do his
tasks so I was just taking care of him. You weren't here as well. And you thought of making
the most of the opportunity, right? And you. How are you doing? I wasn't okay, but now that
you are here, I think I'll be fine. Zoya, sit down. Yeah. Why don't you feed him his breakfast? Aima, please give me some time,
I need to talk to Zoya. Yeah, sure, just remember to take your medicine
when you are done with your breakfast. Zoya, I missed you so much. So much. I heard that you had an accident. Yeah, I did. But you know, the pain due the that accident is nothing compared to the pain it
caused me to be away from you. Honestly, Zoya, I can't live
without you, please believe me. Have your breakfast, it's getting cold. I promise you that. Please, just let me... let me live in your house. I will be in your life and in your
house just like an old thing lying around. Please. Zaid is just yours and he will
stay yours, I promise you that. Did Zaid talk to you? Did he say anything? No. -Did he?
-He didn't come to my room. And even if he did, what
would have he said to me? That he is indebted that I have destroyed
his happily married life? Why are you thinking like that? What should I think then?
Haven't I committed a sin? Your disagreement is valid. Had I been at your place
I would have done the same. I have an idea how much I have hurt
you, how much pain I have caused you. But please believe me,
I'm going through the same agony. You have caused this agony to yourself. If it were in a person's hand he would
never hurt himself and his loved ones. Just because of this decision of yours, \
everyone has got hurt. Whatever there was between us love, trust, friendship, you have ended it all, Zaid. It hasn't ended, Zoya, I'm going
to make everything all right. I'll make everything like it was before. You are mistaken here,
nothing can become as it was before. This new relationship
has ruined everything. Neither previous relations
nor previous attachments, nothing can be repaired. Don't say that, Zoya, you have no idea
how much I missed you. Please. I beg you, just don't say that. I love you yesterday, today,
and I will always love you. And Aima? What about her? Will you be unfair to him? Won't you give her rights to her? She is your wife now as well. - Yeah, but there is nothing in my heart for her...
- Don't you tell me that you don't love her. Because I know that you
love her very much, Zaid. The feelings don't change
with the situations. I have never been
through so much problems in my life. I think I am going to break down. But one thing is clear, Zoya, I can't live without you. Only I know how every moment,
every hour that I have spent without you. I swear if you hadn't come back then... I would have died. I just couldn't bear it. I couldn't take it. Your sorrow, your pain. Did you ever
think what trauma I have been through? I know, I know, Zoya. I was worried about
you all the time. I tried to contact you. I tried my best to let
you know what I feel but... Your wife is here to take care of you. Your anger is valid, Zoya. Do whatever you like,
swear at me, scold me, in fact I won't have any objection
even if you are going to kill me. I'm telling the truth, Zoya. Do whatever you want but
please don't leave me again. I can't live without you. The sorrows that I have draped myself with
Are burning my body I have learned to burn
By looking at the fire. Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that. Even you don't know it
Just my God knows it Whenever I think of getting apart from you
I get scared I don't need anyone. Whatever happened, what's going to happen
in future, I'm responsible for that myself. Stop being so stubborn.
Till when is this going to go on? You have been like this since a week. You should keep in mind that you aren't
just hurting yourself but all of us as well. I haven't hurt anyone, Aima, nor
anybody needs to worry about me. How can we not worry about you? You are very important for us. Really? I was telling you all this is just
a drama, and it won't last long. Okay, fine, I'll talk to you in a while. Okay bye. - Who were you talking to?
- It was mama. Okay, how is Zaid doing? Doctor has told him to avoid movement. He has asked him for bed rest. I think he is badly hurt. Faiq, I was thinking
that I should go see Zaid. Yeah, you should. Well then let's go together. I'm calling mama to tell he
that we'll come tonight for dinner. No, I was saying just like that. What do you mean just like that?
What's the problem in that? What are you talking about, Nosheen? Don't you remember how he held my
collar at the wedding day? And nothing has changed right now. It's over Faiq, till when
are you going to hold this grudge? Look, this is not something small. And I feel really ashamed
going in front of them all. Come on, people get away
after doing what not, and you are blaming yourself by
just marrying with your own choice? If anybody misbehaves with me there,
I will be offended. Zaid is your brother in law, and who
would dare to misbehave with you? Nosheen, I think this is not the
right time so please, don't force me. - Okay just listen.
- Hurry up I'm going to take a shower. Look at this, my friend Farri. She has
gone to visit Maldives with her husband. - Yeah, so?
- Look how beautiful is that place. -Yeah it is.
-She was telling me that it is very safe for tourists. Nosheen, why are you telling me all this?
I already know that. You... just forget it. All right. Why do you get angry? I'm showing you these pictures so
that you think about our honeymoon. Otherwise why would I show you
someone else's pictures? Okay, we will go but
it's not the right time. Why? What's wrong? I mean, just look
at the situations. Mom, is angry with me, there are
problems going on in your house too. So how can we relax in
some other country like this? We can do it, Faiq because
we are not responsible for others. Nosheen, these aren't strangers.
It's our family which is unhappy with us. Faiq, it doesn't make any
difference to anyone even if we stay here. Till when are you going
to suppress yourself? That's why to hell with
everyone and just enjoy life. Look, Faiq, nobody is happy with
anyone even if we give our lives for them. I have just one principle in my life.
Live your life and to hell with others. Do you get what I'm saying? Only we should be important for each other. I'm going to my room. Zoya, where were you? I went for something important. I know very well what
important work was it. Mom, please, I am not
in the mood right now. Why are you doing all this, Zoya? Mom, I told you, I don't want
to talk about anything. You can't leave until you answer me. Don't you have any sense? Anybody would come and blackmail
you emotionally and you would follow him? You forgot everything what he did with you? Do you remember what they have done
to you, or should I remind you? I remember. And you still went to his home? I didn't know that after getting married to that , you
are going to lose your self respect too. Try to recognize your rights, dear. This is a world of wolves. People are ready to prey
on innocent people like you. You are spending your life in a delusion. Should I tell you what's
going on in your head? You still think that
Aima is your well-wisher and Zaid loves you a lot. - Mom, he really loves me a lot.
- For God's sake, Zoya, all this love and affection is useless. If someone loves you so much he
wouldn't have humiliated you like that. Mom, please stop torturing me. Please. I'm torturing you? Me? And your husband, and that Aima,
your best friend, what did they do to you? Mom, can you please leave me alone? I don't want to talk about it. Zoya, you can't do this. -I won't let you do it, do you hear me?
-No! Faiq, ain't I looking nice? Yeah, you're looking nice. Obviously, you didn't like me for nothing. By the way, where are you going? I was thinking that we
should go somewhere out today. Let's get some food from a nice
restaurant and go to the beach. Nosheen, I don't remember one day after our
marriage when we didn't go out and eat. I think we should take a break. Please, Faiq. Look, all things can't happen
according to you all the time. Besides, I have to go to
the restaurant from tomorrow, take care of all the arrangements, and in
fact I am busy with them right now as well. But it's your own business, 
tell the manager, he'll manage. What are you talking about? In a business an owner has to invest
more of his time than the employs. And you should be aware of all that,
after all you are a businessman's daughter. You'll go at work from tomorrow
and I'll get bored at home alone. Well then don't sit idle, 
you won't be bored then. What do you mean? I mean that you should take
responsibilities in the house. What responsibilities are
you talking about, Faiq? Means, responsibilities
regarding this home. Looking after the kitchen, cook,
what housewives usually do, what else? But, mama does all these things. She does, but you should help her. In fact, I think we
should let her rest now. You should take care of
the responsibilities now. - Faiq, we have just been married.
- So what? What would my family think? I just got married and got
busy with chores right away. They won't think anything, Nosheen. I'm not asking you to plough a field. I'm asking you to do house
chores which every woman does. So should I work all day long? No, manage your time. Do
your chores along with enjoyment. Besides, it won't be too difficult for you
with just three people in this house. Yeah, that's true but... But what? Actually, I'm not used to do so much work.
so can't we hire a maid? No, not a maid. Mom may not like it. Because she likes to do everything herself. And she had planned that
when her daughter in law comes she will hand over all
the responsibilities to her. And now is the time to
take over the responsibilities. Besides, it's nice, this way you'll get 
a chance to help mom and get close to her. May be she can forgive her because of that. Yeah, but you mom doesn't
even like to talk to me. Tell me, how much effort did
you put in to talk to her, to know her, to get close to her? Nosheen, marriage doesn't
mean that one has fun all the time, move around and go places. It involves taking care of 
the relatives and family members too. You have to take everything along. Be serious. Please ask them to get me a cup of tea. I swear, never again. I will never take any
decision that hurts you. Nor will I let anybody
make such a decision. It's a promise and I won't let it break. He got very upset when Zoya left. He was like that for everyone. Now that she is back, 
he will accept you too. Not only as a friend, 
but as a wife as well. You should have been to
your in laws on your way back then. - Why?
- Because your wife has gone there. Do you actually want that
we become sisters again? - Yeah, Amber, of course.
- It's possible on one condition only that you remove Aima from Zoya's way.
