From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you There has been lot of change in Zaid
in past few months. There is one more child of yours
in this house other than Zaid. If you have taken her back in
then why don't you forgive her as well? Why do you keep mentioning her? Isn't it enough
that I have allowed her back home? Actually, your dad has
chosen a boy for you. Really? Yes, I don't know his name but my heart tells me
that he has chosen Zaid for you. Look, you can understand
my concern regarding Nosheen. Yes, sister, what is it? Tell me. And since Azmat has denied to take her to
his office, I am even more concerned, Amber. Yes, I got to know about it
and felt really bad about it. Because brother Azmat should care
about her after all she is his daughter. Had he cared for her, our house
wouldn't have been like hell, Amber. -Amber, I have to say something to you.
-Yes please? You have indebted me so
much in the past few days. Sister, what are you talking about? I haven't done any favors to you. Whenever you are in
a problem you can share it with me. Yes I know, that's why
there is another request. Oh come on, please
say what you want to say. You run your office quite well, you have
a good business and you are well settled. So, I was saying that why don't you hire Nosheen? Nosheen? Sister,  actually... What is it? Any problem, Amber? Yes, I wanted to say that she hasn't
even completed her education yet. And neither did you make her
take some course or diploma. Or else I would have definitely hired her. Amber, it's going to take too much time. There is no such course these days
which is less than a year's duration. Can't you just take her
to office with you, Amber? She is going to get trained
herself. And then later on I will ask Azmat and
get her placed in his office. No, I'm sorry, this isn't possible at all. Actually, we have to train our new staff. And then, I have faced so much
loss in my business last year that instead of hiring
employs we are firing them. Amber, I am not asking you
to hire her and pay her a salary. I just want that you keep her with you so that later on I have a reason
to get her placed in Azmat's office. Sister, I would have definitely kept her
with me, but you know how busy I am. Sometimes I am at office, sometimes
at the factory or to some meeting. For some work at office... Then just keep her in the office,
give her any petty task. Sister, this isn't possible at all. Besides, there is
all male staff in my office. I have even kept Zoya
away from my office, because this work can't be done
by girls, they can't survive there. -All right.
-Ask her to take some nice course. There is so much scope these days. When girls pass out with
a certificate people hire them instantly. Okay, let me know if you
can arrange something else. -All right?
-Yeah, sure. I'll try. Good bye. Nosheen. Shabana's concern over
this relationship is valid. I shouldn't keep her in ambiguity. I had hurt her once earlier as well. I think it's time
that I talk to Zaid about it. Shabana would get a definite answer too. Aima, I'm really scared. It's beating so fast, this has
never happened to me before. Have you told that girl that you love her? No. Means you are going
to propose that girl tomorrow -and introduce us to her tomorrow too?
-Yes. Okay, so are you going to
pick her yourself tomorrow? Where has he gone at this hour? -Durrani.
-Yes, sir? Come here. -Have you seen Zaid?
-Yes, sir, he was with Shabana madam. Oh, okay. Fine. And what did you tell her
why are you calling? I think she must have had an idea by now. -Okay.
-I don't know if she agrees or not. Don't worry, whatever
happens will happen for good. Okay, let's assume that I
tell you that I love you and want to marry you. What will be your answer then? Tell me what will be your answer? Will you marry me? My answer would be that you have gone mad. You have started joking again. Zaid you just asked me to assume. There is a lot of difference
in imagination and reality. We think something else,
and something else happens. Okay, if I am thinking that
she is going to accept my proposal, then according to your philosophy
it's going to be the opposite of that? Well, I mean that God makes it happen so
well that we have never imagined it that way. Aima, I feel like someone
could forward a day of life and tell me what is
going to happen tomorrow. Me too. You know, Aima, I can't
do anything without you. You are my support. You know, I share each and everything with
you. Every thing, every feeling, emotions. If you weren't there what
would have I done? At times I feel like I know
you even better than myself. Well, I know that. Tell me that girl's name. You'll get to know. It's just a matter
of few hours, then you'll know too. Oh, what's in just the name? Oh! Everything is in the name. Listen , groom yourself properly tomorrow. I've called Zoya too,
I want to make this special. What is it brother, you're smiling? Today all the ambiguities have
been removed from my mind, Shabana. Is it regarding Zaid? I am feeling pleasure for
God knows how many days. May God prevails your happiness. I'm really happy today, Shabana.
At least one of my children have taken the right
decision about their marriage. And he has chosen a girl whom he needed, whose character is matchless. Her habits are traditional
and her mentality is modern. I am sure Aima is going to complete Zaid. Have you talked to Zaid about it? This won't be needed. Anyhow I am going to make this
matter official as soon as possible. Brother, I can understand your
happiness about this relationship. And I know that your decision
is going to be right. But I don't know why, I am a little concerned
regarding this relationship. I can understand what you're trying to say. Look, brother, please don't mind. I have no enmity with anyone. Every person has
a little good and bad in him. But I fear that sister is not going to accept Aima
as the daughter in law of this family. Don't worry. Almas has to accept
Aima as the daughter in law of this family. Because prior to me, Aima is Zaid's choice. Zaid and Aima like each other. Has Zaid told this to you? It isn't necessary, Shabana, that
everything is expressed only by saying it. Nevertheless, don't worry, it's absolutely
true that they both like each other. You don't believe it, do you? Brother, if you are saying it then
there must be some reason behind it. It's just that I am surprised. I am surprised as well.
But more than that I'm happy. But if that's how it is,
why didn't Aima say something to me? She might have wanted to say something
but she couldn't because she felt shy. Yes, this must be the reason. Tell me, where are both
of these hidden geniuses? Both of them have gone out. They had some plan with friends and
they said that they are going to eat out. All right. Did you eat anything? -No, I'll eat with you.
-All right. Us siblings are going
to eat more in happiness. Don't worry, whatever
happens will happen for good. Okay, let's assume that I
tell you that I love you and want to marry you. What will be your answer then? Tell me what will be your answer? Will you marry me? My answer would be that you have gone mad. You have started joking again. Zaid you just asked me to assume. There is a lot of difference
in imagination and reality. Hello? Yeah, Zoya, I'm ready. You can come. Sit, sit. Wow! That girl must be so special
for whom you have brought this. Yeah, she is special. You know how difficult
it was for us to get here? It better be worth it. It will be. I promise. Where is the madam? -She is here.
-Then call her. Why are you hiding her? She... No, not right now, later. Listen, if you are introducing us
to the girl at least buy us dinner, right Aima? Shall we do that first
what we are here for? Right, Aima? That's what I am saying, let us meet her. Okay, both of you shut your eyes. -Seriously, Zaid?
-Do it. Shut your eyes. Okay, the girl whom I... am going to introduce you, you both know her already. She has always been with me. Near me. We have fought with
each other, laughed too. But we never got separated. -What?
-Shut your eyes and listen to the whole thing. The petty things she did
which irritated me, I never had an idea that I am going
to fall in love with those things. She has always been my friend. But when did it happen and how it happened, I didn't realize. I haven't taken this
decision being emotional, but I have thought
over it a lot. And I hope that this decision
doesn't effect our friendship. Zoya! Zoya you can open your eyes now. I love you, Zoya. Will you marry me? I don't know what to say. Zoya, you can open your eyes now. I love you, Zoya. Will you marry me? Why did Zoya ask for some time?
I mean doesn't she trust me? Aima... She would never pick up her
phone when it's something important. Zaid, I think I need some time to think. What does she have to think about? I'm going to talk to her directly. No, no. She has asked for some time. Have patience. I should give her time,
I should give her some privacy. Some time. Time. Time. Oh, man! I haven't taken this
decision being emotional, but I have thought over it a lot. And I hope that this decision
doesn't effect our friendship. The petty things she did
which irritated me, I never had an idea that I am going
to fall in love with those things. I love you, Zoya. Will you marry me? What is this behaviour? What's wrong, Zaid? Aima, do you have any idea how
many times have I called you last night? Really? Actually I just got tired
so I fell asleep. Didn't realize. What's wrong, Aima.
You used to consider my problem as yours. If I used to stay up all night
then you didn't sleep as well. You know, I even knocked your door. Really? I didn't realize.
Maybe I was in deep sleep. You wake up so easily, why all of
a sudden you are having such a deep sleep. Are you ignoring me? No, Zaid, it's nothing like that. Oh, this means you are angry with me. No, I told you, it's
nothing like that, Zaid. Wait a second. What's wrong with your face? What's wrong? What is it? It's fine. No, it's not. I can clearly see
it's swollen. Were you crying? Zaid, you just get after one thing. I just had a little fever at night, so... maybe that's the reason of swelling. Why didn't you tell me this then? I didn't tell you so that
you might get worried. Won't I be worried now? -Come here, show me how much fever you got?
-I'm fine, I checked last night. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. I took medicine last night and
maybe that's why I fell asleep and I couldn't respond to your calls. Silly, do you know what day it is today? Yes, it's a gap day for university. Really, you know? Then why are you going then? Ma'am Maryam has conducting
a seminar so I am going to help her. Wow, just great. Go ahead, help the whole world
except for him who needs you the most. Really? You know, I haven't slept all night. I just couldn't sleep. And as soon as I
got up then I didn't feel like eating too. You are waiting for
Zoya's response so much? Yes, man. Since she has asked for some time,
my own timing has been disturbed. Zaid, why are you getting worried?
You will get your dream girl. Dream girl, really? The words you said to her,
the way you proposed her, looking at that it seems so. I mean, I mean I love her. And I had this realization all of a sudden. You know, when she got that proposal
and she agreed to get married, I just... I just felt like... I can't stay away from her and
whatever is happening is completely long. Moreover, me and her have
such good understanding. And I would have
eventually had to get married. So I thought why not? You know, take
a chance? Marry somebody you know? Okay, listen, what do you say, 
is she going to say yes? What do you think? To tell you the truth there
is a turmoil in my heart. Sometimes I think that she would say yes considering
our friendship and understanding. But then I think that she might take this
point and make it the reason of saying no. And I'm telling you if that happens
that it's going to be really bad. Our friendship would be at stake. Zaid, why are you getting worried? Everything is going to be fine, 
have some patience. Okay, I got to go now. I'm getting late. Just one more thing, please. Did I do the right thing? There is nothing more honest
than what the heart tells you. So you should listen to it, Zaid. My heart tells me 
that I have done the right thing. Then you have done the right thing. * Zoya, what have you decided? I don't know, Mom. But you have to choose one of them. I made up my mind for Daniyal with such
difficulty, and now Zaid has come forward. I'm so confused. But you have to take a decision. I need some time. And I can't take a hasty decision. But you have to, Zoya. Just give me some time. The issue is that the groom's family 
are coming tomorrow. And if you opt for Zaid, then I am not
calling them just to sit at the dining table. Two heroes have entered
my life at the same time. Naughty girl. 
Your hero is just one of them. By the way, Mom, you have met
Daniyal and obviously Zaid too. If I ask you to think over it
then whose side will you be on? It's going to be difficult. See, I just wanted to ask you
and you have given up right away. My life is in question here. Actually, the problem is that
both options are very nice. But still, there are so
many questions in my mind. Like what? Like, has Zaid taken this decision
with his family's consent? And then how long will Zaid take 
to get established? Then I also have doubts to get you
married in immediate family or not. And for now, you and Zaid are best friends. But how would be as a husband, who knows? So many concerns? So much is going on in my mind. All of this is going on in my mind too. 
I just don't understand. Mom, I'm afraid. That if I reject Zaid, he might get hurt. -And if I accept him then...
-Then? Then what if I get hurt? Do you doubt that Zaid isn't
going to keep you happy? No, Mom, it's not about Zaid. 
He's my best friend. I have no issues with him. But you know about his family. I will have to develop 
a new relationship with them. And you know uncle too. The rules and regulations of his house. And Nosheen's habits. 
How am I going to adjust? I think, I should leave
you alone for a while. So that you can figure out yourself. That would be better for you. -I have to talk to you about something.
-Regarding what? Regarding your son. Is it something about Hammad? I have always had much
expectations from my children  but they were never able to meet them. Because of which I have been 
very strict with them. And I kept taking decisions 
on their behalf. But whatever has happened in the
past few days, I have learned from it that no matter how
useless your children are, parents shouldn't take any decisions 
against their will. Then they get compelled
to take some wrong step. It's great that you 
have realized it yourself. I have realized that everyone 
has a different way of thinking. He thinks about things
with his own mind, he looks at things with his own
perspective and experiences. As their parents we can only guide them. In the end everybody should be
independent to take his decisions. Everything all right, Azmat? Are you
going to say all positive things today? The thing is that a person can
move towards betterment only then when he is able to accept his mistakes. And to tell you the truth, 
it gives me a lot of pleasure that you have started
accepting your mistakes too. And correcting yourself. -What mistakes are you talking about?
-No, nothing special. It's just that you don't have an
objection on every other thing now and I like that in you. I have a lot of objections, Azmat, 
but I just keep quiet. But don't consider my
silence as my acceptance. I am really angry about
Aima going to your office. Once again your are making
an issue of a petty thing. It's not a petty thing, Azmat, depriving your own child of her
rights and giving others their right, is not a petty thing. I don't want that whenever we sit
together we part after having a fight. You have said such a thing. We just drifted from the topic. Actually I came to tell you a good news. What good news? Don't you seriously have any idea 
what I am talking about? -No.
-Really? Means he hasn't told you anything? -Who? Who are you talking about? Zaid?
-Yes. Your son likes someone. -Who's calling?
-Amber. All right, take your call. 
I'll talk to you later. I have to go somewhere 
for some important work, okay? Really? I didn't know that. Amber, why delay this noble task? What do you mean? I mean to say that we won't keep 
a very long engagement period. I thought that when I'll propose her, her reaction is going 
to be the same as it was yours. What reaction? When we were practicing at least you
took my proposal seriously, and she started laughing, I mean seriously? Nothing is okay. The kind of things going
on in this house, how can anything be okay? -Why, Dad, what's wrong?
-You guys are going to tell me that. Tell me one thing, Zaid. Why did
you keep such a big thing from me? What are you talking about, Dad?
