From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned to chirp from you You were right. I was always wrong. They are never going to let me be happy. And Zaid is just like a puppet. I am not scared of your threats, nor
am I scared of your threats to hit me. These aren't just threats, Nosheen.
The way you are misbehaving, I'm afraid these threats
might turn into reality. Mama, I can't tell you, his mother is
nothing in compared to Faiq's cleverness. My fate is ruined.
Oh, God where did I get married. Listen madam, why are you blaming God now? His nature tried it's best that
you don't jump into this hell. But you were your own enemy. You always thing I am the one who is wrong. Greetings, Dad. Yeah, we have reached safely. No, there wasn't any issue. Yes, he is with me, shall
I give him the phone? Okay, good bye. It was Dad. He just wanted
to know if we are okay. Okay. Shall I get your clothes
ready for tomorrow's meeting? No leave it I will get them ready myself. -What's your problem?
-What is wrong? I have called you twice for lunch, and now I have left my lunch
and came here to call you. Who told you to do that? I had
told Liaqat that I don't want to eat. What is this? I am worrying
about you and your behaviour? So who told you
to worry about me? Right, so that you get a
chance to complain Zaid. That when he was away
nobody cared about you. I know how clever you are. I am taking care of you that doesn't
mean that you take it to your head. What is the way you are talking with me? Just bring peace to your life and rest. I have no expectations from you. I just don't get it. If we take care of you then you have
a problem, and if not even then it is a problem. You guys have made my life so difficult. I don't know who has complained to you. But you should stop worrying about me. Oh, God, Zoya. Don't you have any
regard of your and my relationship? You are talking so rudely. Excuse me auntie,
I haven't been rude to you yet. If you had taught your daughter so
much manners, it would have been great. Today, everyone would have been at peace. Don't you dare bring my
daughter, Nosheen, between all this. I won't tolerate. You mother and daughter
always bring Nosheen in between. Oh, God! Auntie, please leave
before I lose my temper. Oh, so you are going to
kick me out of my own house? This is my house and you
should keep that in your mind. Okay, fine. Stay in your house.
I am leaving. Zoya, you don't need to go back to
that house at all until Zaid gets back. Mom, my blood is boiling. Auntie has misbehaved with me
so much that you can't even imagine. I am going to bring her
back to her senses, you'll see. Leave it, it's no use. If she had any consideration, she
wouldn't have done it in the first place. Let her come tomorrow, I will tell her. She will just come and start her drama. We are sisters, who else do
we have other than ourselves. Let her come, then I am going to tell
her which blood and what relationship. Don't you worry about her. Who else should I not worry about, Mom? At times I feel like leaving
everything and return to my home. At least there was peace here. I had my freedom, my friends. After this new relationship, I am left
with nothing. Everything has changed. Take it easy my dear. No relationship is so simple. You'll see. You are going
through a tough time right now. You and Zaid are going to lead a
very good, happy life in a few days. Away from all these nonsensical people. I'm trying, Mom. But to tel you
the truth I really find all this too difficult. I just feel like that
this torture should end. My dear. Everything is going
to be fine, just have courage. -Here's your file.
-Thank you. Okay listen, it's too late.
Why don't you rest. What about you? I have some work to do. I'll manage. Aima. I'm sorry. I have an idea how much
I have hurt you since past few days. It's okay. doesn't matter. I really need you in my life. I know. Please, just rest. Please, just stop fighting, you two. -We are not fighting.
-So, are you expressing love like this? Aima got it. Actually, the love between
Zoya and me is just like that. I knew it. Truth has come
out of your mouth eventually. What can I do, I couldn't wait any longer. Anyway, if you have fallen in
love with me then I don't mind. Please. Zoya, it's time that you
confess too how much you love me. Zaid, Zaid! Zaid, Zoya's calling. Hello. Zoya, what happened? Are you all right? -Yeah, I'm fine.
-Why are you crying? I was just feeling worried. -Listen, is everything okay?
-I have seen a really bad dream, Zaid. Are you all right? No, relax I'm perfectly fine.
Calm down relax. Everything is fine here. I'm relieved, finally! Me too. Let's tell dad about it. No, no, don't tell dad right now.
The final decision still has to be taken. You will raise his
expectations for no reason. Just wait, you never know
what happens at last moment. You are right. But it's night that our first
step has been very successful. -What's wrong?
-Nothing. Okay then I am going to order tea. By the way, listen, where
shall we have dinner tonight. In fact, there is a very nice restaurant
nearby, Shavez has praised their food a lot. -What's wrong? Aren't you hungry?
-No. But you had so little
even there too, I saw you. Yeah, actually I didn't feel like it. Okay then we are going out in an hour.
We'll have good food and have a good time. -You should change.
-Why? aren't these clothes all right? No, they are fine too.
I meant if you wanted to get fresh. -Okay.
-Okay? Okay then, be ready.
We'll go together for shopping tomorrow. Zaid there is no need. I have so
many clothes, I can wear any of them. "Zaid there is no need", what do you
mean are you going to wear old clothes? By old clothes, I don't mean
that I am going to wear rags. You don't worry, whatever
I am going to wear, I will look good. Just leave it, and keep quiet. And you are
coming with me for shopping in the morning. Zaid, I have told you, I don't need any. Okay then come with me
to get auntie's dress then. Zaid did you talk to Nosheen? Yeah, oh yes, no issues. Just book it,
no matter how expensive it is. Yeah, okay, I'll get
your payment transferred. Okay. Good morning. What's wrong?
Didn't you sleep well last night? No, I slept very late last night. Yeah, I can see that. Come on, Zoya, you don't look
nice being so dull. Stay a little fresh. I don't feel like it, Mom. -Besides, there should be a reason to get ready.
-Zoya, you are saying it of all people? Since when do you need an occasion
to get ready or an excuse to stay happy? Tell me, did that company from
Dubai gave you any offer again? -They contacted me twice.
-Then? I was so caught up then
that I didn't respond them. But why, Zoya? Isn't it your passion? 
Why aren't you following it then? It was my passion, 
but I don't feel like it any more. Zoya, getting married doesn't mean
that one just stops caring about oneself. And I can't see you like this. Please, I want my old Zoya back. Zoya. Zoya, my dear, nobody's life is easy. You have to make it easy. And I want you to
continue with your passion. Once you get back from your honeymoon,
then continue with your modeling again. Mom, you were always against my career. What is it with you now? I think that you need it right now. You will be so lonely 
when I'm going to get married. So you should get married too 
right after me. Right now you tell me, 
when are you getting married? In around 4-5 years. 4-5 years? Really? Mom, I'm kidding. I will get married,
I just wanted to see your reaction. On a serious note, 
when I will leave tomorrow, then you are going to be so lonely. So what are you going to do then? The same, I will take care of my
home and my business, what else? But still, I won't be there with you. You must feel so lonely. Aima, how long will you take? Just five more minutes, Zaid. What? I said, just five minutes. Show me. It's supposed to be closed like this, okay. Nice watch, come, come on hurry up. Get up. Yeah. Are you done talking? What's your problem. If we sister and brother talk to each
other, what's your issue with it? Why would I have a problem. Go ahead finish talking if there
is still something left to talk about. Whatever you want to
talk about say it clearly. Don't you always 
talk this nonsense with me. Everything I do or say 
seems nonsense to you. God has given all the wisdom 
to you brother and sister. That's the reason I don't want to talk to
you that you are always ready to taunt me. Why shouldn't I? Can't you see? -What's wrong?
-Faiq and his mother are torturing Nosheen. So? What do you mean by so? Nosheen is our
daughter, how can be someone so bad to her? He is her husband and she is her
mother in law, let her deal with them. -What can I do in this regard?
-Why not? This is why girls' in
laws make their lives hell because they don't get any
support from their families. Not at all. Girls ruin their lives themselves. 
I have seen it. I have seen how girls don't forgive
anything when they go to their in laws, like they used to do in their own home. The truth is that they never accept
their in laws as their own family. That's why they dislike everything
that is said by their in laws. It's just how you think it is
but doesn't necessarily be true. I also think that the girls who
have complains with their in laws that they don't treat them well, they should re-assess
their own character first. If you are done with your lecture
then I wanted to ask you something, that I wanted to gift Faiq and Nosheen
a world tour honeymoon package. Oh, so your daughter wants to go too
just because Zaid and Zoya are going? Yeah, so what's wrong with that?
They are newly married as well. Look if you keep supporting Nosheen
every time when she is being stubborn then I don't think her
marriage could go on. God forbid, what are you saying, Azmat? All I wanted was to tell you that maybe
this way her marriage can be secured. I'm sleepy. Switch off the lights. The food was so good. -Yeah.
-I told you to try the steak, it was really nice. -Yeah, so.
-Why aren't you answering your phone? Is it Zoya? I think you should talk to her. Hello. Zaid, where are you? 
I've been calling you for so long. I went to have dinner at a restaurant. What? With whom? -What kind of a question is this, Zoya?
-What kind of answer is it? Answer about what has been asked to you. And don't ask question
over a question to me. What is the way you are talking to me? Whatever I am doing with
you right now, Zaid, is very less. -Listen, Zoya, can yo please behave?
-Shut up, Zaid. You shut up man, what's wrong with you? I can't believe, 
Dad still doesn't believe Aima? Moreover, he has refused
to listen to your witness too. Zaid, you were right to stop me. If uncle had said all those things in
front of me, I would have felt really bad. I just don't understand why is
dad even considering Aima a liar? Specially when you are ready 
to testify in her favor. The reason is quite simple. 
Uncle doesn't like me. I have always noticed it. Zoya, why would dad dislike you? I have always felt that, and every
person has his own likes and dislikes. Look, this might be your
misunderstanding too. It's not a misunderstanding, 
I mean I have seen him avoiding me. But anyways, right now it's
Aima's matter right now, not mine. So I am just concerned that till
when is she going to stay at home and what will happen to her studies? Stupid, this means that she isn't that
important for him as much as we thought. I mean she isn't even close to our level. -But why did you do so?
-Idiot, because of you. Because of me? Yeah, because your issues were
going on so his temper was loose. And even if I had said something to him at
that time then he would have scolded me too. What's wrong? -Nothing.
-So what was I saying? Yeah, steak. Next time you have to try
the steak, even Shavez was praising it. -Aima, there is a problem.
-What happened? -The meeting has been canceled.
-But why? Mr. Mirza's mother has passed away. So he has given his employs off 
for two days. Now the meeting will be on Monday. But have our flight booked 
for tomorrow night. So, what are we going to do now? Honestly, I have no idea. 
I don't know what to do. If we cancel this meeting
and go back tonight then all our efforts will be wasted 
and dad is going to get hurt too. Yeah, but if we don't go back, your
and Zoya's plan will be disturbed again. No, that's not an issue, 
auntie has postponed the trip. If we attend Monday's
meeting and then go back in the evening to stay at home can still catch
a late night flight for my trip. So, what are we going to do now? We will have to cancel our flight,
we don't have any other option. Okay then call Zoya. I'm not calling her, Aima. Again you are being stubborn. Why do
you guys start fighting over petty issues? This isn't a petty issue, Aima. You
know how she misbehaved with me today. And then she hung up on me. You know this is how she
reacts when she is angry. What kind of anger is this? I am not her slave that I should be alert
all then time that Zoya may call any minute. Look, Zaid, what's done is done. Don't prolong it. She must be already very disturbed
because her plans were canceled. And now she has had a fight with you too. I know very well that she
must be really upset right now. Whatever, Aima, I am not calling her again. She should know that she is not
supposed to talk to me in this tone. -Zaid, please call her.
-Please, Aima, don't force me. Mom, do you have my phone? Yes, I brought it here 
so that you don't wake up. Did Zaid call? No, I didn't get any call. What's wrong? Why did you two fight? No, nothing. Nothing happened. If nothing has happened, why have
you hurt yourself on the hand then? No, nothing, we didn't have any fight. What is it, Zoya? 
What are you thinking about? Mom, I can't share Zaid with anybody. I don't want Aima in his life. I tried to explain this to you 
a lot earlier. But you didn't get that you won't be
able to tolerate this relationship at all. But you insisted. Mom, there is no use 
to argue over what has been done. And besides I am really frustrated. I just want a solution to this problem. Then there is just one solution 
to this problem. Hello. Hello? Who is this? Why don't
you talk if you are calling? You must have a lot
of free time but I don't. If you call again then I am going
to give your number to my husband, he is going to talk to you then. Don't know what kind of a looser does such things. You won't give up like that. I am going to
give your number to cyber crime right now. Nosheen. -Who is this?
-Faisal here. That's the reason we
had to postpone our flight. No problem, dear. It's good 
as much as you both can enjoy together. Aima, are you happy dear? Yes, a lot. Zoya, Zaid's flight must have landed. What time was his flight? It must have landed at 7 o'clock. but it's 10:30 now. He should have come by now to pick you up. -Listen, Nosheen.
-What now? Actually? can you lend me some money?
