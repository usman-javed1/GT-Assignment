[0.09] From flowers and from buds
[4.36] I have learnt to bloom and be fragrant 
[9.28] When I saw you 
[14.18] I learnt how to chirp from you
[18.78] Brother, what if
Aima has committed suicide?
[23.62] Just shut up, Nosheen.  Can't you
say something nice for once?
[27.88] -Aima!
-What is this madness?
[29.75] -Why are you taking the trouble on yourself?
-Auntie I think we will have to break the door.
[32.91] Are you mad?  You will be trapped,
the police are going to arrest you.
[36.25] What the hell are you talking about?
[37.18] If something happens to Aima,
I won't spare anyone.
[39.04] -God knows, what this...
-Aima!
[52.94] It's a diamond set, I got it for Nosheen.
[55.22] But I haven't shown it to her yet.
[57.67] Wow, the set is amazing.
[61.02] And this would look
really pretty on Nosheen.
[66.04] Just this is of 0.45 million Rupees.
[70.94] I thought, why not prepare her dowry now.
[74.52] If a proposal comes, I wouldn't
have to roam around markets then.
[78.82] That's the right thing to do, sister.
[81.67] Listen, have you started preparing
Aima's dowry?
[87.25] Oh, no...
[91.28] Nothing for now, sister.
[94.97] But the jewelry I already have,
I'm going to give that to Aima.
[102.21] Yes you shouldn't be worried
about it that much.
[107.03] What do you mean, sister?
[108.78] You won't have to
roam around markets like I do.
[115.68] Whatever Aima puts her finger on,
[117.71] her uncle would make sure she gets it.
[124.89] But these things don't matter, sister.
[131.08] We should just pray
[134.02] that God may give them the best fate.
[137.06] I just pray that all girls
get a fate like you people.
[143.90] No worries about food,
clothing and living.
[150.45] God forbid, sister.
[153.89] May Nosheen never have a fate like mine.
[161.12] May God keep her husband's
shelter always on her.  Amen.
[170.25] I'll just go check up on chores.
[181.79] Aima, okay I'm sorry,
just open the door once.
[186.15] Aima what is this childish behavior.
[188.30] I admit it's my fault, just
listen to me once.
[193.17] Aima, open the door, man.
[196.32] -Aima.
-What's up brother?
[200.97] -Nothing.
-Why isn't Aima opening the door then?
[205.18] She is angry with me.
[207.53] Brother, what if Aima
has committed suicide?
[212.45] Just shut up, Nosheen.
Say something nice for once.
[215.94] Okay, let me say something nice.
[218.18] Oh, God, if Aima has tried to commit
suicide, please save her then.
[222.71] You're just pissing me off.  Get lost
from here before I do anything.
[226.02] What are you going to do, brother?  Are you
going to lock yourself up and cry too?
[230.06] -I'm not joking.
-I know no one is joking.
[234.47] But a drama is going on for sure.
[237.29] -Nosheen, just get lost.  Please, get lost.
-Fine.
[246.17] Aima...
[276.10] -Are you going somewhere?
-Me, just like that.
[281.87] Tell me, there was a payment made
of 0.45 million from the card,
[286.01] I just wanted to know where you spent them?
[289.31] I was just waiting for you
to ask this question.
[292.66] Obviously, you have spent such
a huge amount, I would ask.
[297.86] Don't worry, I haven't bought
anything for myself.
[303.25] I have bought a diamond set for Nosheen.
[306.49] Why?  Is it her birthday?
[309.03] No, no.  For her dowry.
[311.61] That's very good.
[313.75] Please say it again, my ears aren't used
to hearing you praising me.
[319.05] When you do something sensible,
I always appreciate you.
[322.93] I often do sensible things, you aren't
able to see it that's a different matter.
[333.83] Yes, show me.
Wow, it's really beautiful.  very nice.
[339.52] Did Nosheen like it?
[341.53] I haven't shown it to her yet.
[343.38] I am being strict with her these days,
before she does anything else stupid.
[348.27] -Are you feeling okay?
-Yes, I am feeling fine?
[352.67] I mean you are being really wise today.
[356.52] It's just that you are
in a good mood today.
[358.86] Yeah, you can say that.
[361.57] By the way, I was wondering, Aima
is two years older than Nosheen.
[365.61] Shabana should also start collecting
these kinds of things for her.
[371.23] I knew that you were going to start
talking about it any minute now.
[374.40] This is the point where you
and I start having differences.
[379.09] It has been so many years,
[380.77] but you still haven't accepted
my sister and her daughter.
[384.32] If I had not accepted them,
[385.79] I would not have let them stay here
even for a single day.  All right?
[388.51] What should I do for them,
place them on my head?
[391.50] You are really selfish, Almas.
[394.23] If thinking about one's children is
selfishness, Azmat, then I am selfish!
[399.10] Keep your voice low, I have
told you a thousand times.
[403.51] Don't know how much malice
she is carrying in her heart.
[414.14] Why did you do it to her?
[417.33] I don't know, it was just a mistake.
[419.68] First tell me, what were you doing on
the phone that you became so angry?
[423.59] Zoya, I have called you so that you can
convince Aima, not to investigate me.
[428.64] Unless you're going to tell me
what you were doing on the phone,
[432.20] I'm not going to call Aima.
[434.86] I was chatting with someone.
[436.73] Don't try to act smart, who
were you chatting with?
[440.61] There was this girl in section C, Kinza.
[446.93] The one who took my number at the party.
I was chatting with her.
[450.74] You didn't spare girls from
other sections as well?  Zaid...
[454.50] Anyway, tell me are you
coming home to talk to Aima or not?
[458.46] Sorry I won't be able to come, I
have to go to dinner with mother.
[462.75] -Please, come on, Zoya.
-I can't come, why don't you understand?
[466.90] Okay, fine, let me call her.
[469.76] It's just that, I'm feeling a bit weird.
[474.64] You know I can't stand it when
you both get angry, for much longer.
[478.54] Well you took my name
for just the heck of it.
[480.86] I know it's Aima whom you
can't stay angry at.
[484.44] No, it's not like that, you
mean a lot to me as well.
[487.76] Don't worry, she can't stay angry
at you for much longer, either.  Tammu!
[493.19] -I hope.
-Ahan, okay.  Take care
[496.42] Okay, listen, tell me what she said.
[499.39] Yeah, I'll let you know.
I have to go now, okay?  Bye.
[521.15] Mother, are you watching that
play called Closed Doors?
[526.55] I am not in the mood to talk
about any useless drama.
[530.75] Oh, the shoot is going on in your own home,
[533.38] and you know who the hero is?  Your son,
and still you are calling it useless?
[538.26] Tell me clearly what it is?
[541.32] Your son is really worried
because her friend... Aima,
[548.70] Aima the best friend has gotten angry
with him and locked herself up in the room.
[553.23] Oh, that mad boy.
[555.66] Mad?  Crazy is the right word.
[561.19] Because mad people are the same
for everyone, mother.
[564.17] But my brother isn't the same with me.
[567.74] If we get angry with him,
he wouldn't even notice it.
[572.28] That witch has cast a spell on him.
[574.56] And now I don't think that witch is ever going to leave this
house of yours.
[579.07] Meaning?
[580.87] Well, she is going to stay
here as your daughter in law.
[584.44] God forbid.  Zaid would be
better off unmarried than this.
[588.13] I won't let this happen.
[590.83] Well let's see.  For now please look
into this issue right now.
[595.44] -Let me go and check.
-Okay, then, good luck.
[657.56] Why isn't Aima picking up her phone?
[661.97] What the hell is she doing?
[682.25] -What's wrong auntie, tell me?
-She isn't opening the door, I...
[686.10] -I am really worried.
-Just don't worry, come, come with me.
[689.58] Why did I become unwanted
[694.08] {\an8}Nobody knows that
[698.72] Why did I become unwanted
[703.35] {\an8}Nobody knows that Do
[718.64] you have any idea what
your princess is doing?
[722.10] Aima?  What's wrong, what did she do?
[726.28] She has annoyed us so much.
[729.68] Sister, at least tell me what it is?
[733.99] -She has locked herself in the room.
-Aima?
[739.05] -But why?
-She can tell that herself.
[743.09] Okay, don't worry, I'll go see and ask her.
[746.93] Why would I be worried?
[749.25] And if she did anything stupid, I'm
telling you, we shouldn't be blamed.
[754.31] What are you saying, sister?
[757.59] Why are they being so dramatic?
[762.50] Let me go check on her.
[767.33] Aima...
[769.22] Aima, dear?  Aima, open the door.
Talk to me, what's wrong?
[775.03] Aima...
[778.45] Aima has never done that before.
[781.91] I think... has she taken something?
[785.63] God forbid, sister.
[789.60] Aima?  Aima, are you listening to me?
Open the door, Aima.
[793.82] Aima!  Aima!
[796.84] What should I do?
[799.65] What... Sister, sister please listen to me,
[802.25] you have the spare keys, right?
[804.85] There must be one of this room too,
can you please get it?
[807.48] You remember I lost those keys, the key
to this room was with them as well.
[810.65] We never got them made again.
[814.92] What should I do?
[817.93] Aima... Aima, my child.
Just listen to me, Aima.
[821.67] Open the door.  What... what should I do?
Oh, God!  Aima...
[827.40] What's happening?  Aima...
[831.02] I... Yes, Zaid... he is outside.  I'll
call him, we'll have to break the door.
[838.50] Zaid, dear...
[846.45] What do you mean, Zoya?
She isn't picking up your call either?
[850.18] Now tell me what I should do?
[851.33] You know what?  I feel like
breaking the door to her room.
[855.35] -Zaid, Zaid, dear...
-Auntie...
[858.17] Aima... Aima is... -What
[861.52] 's wrong, auntie?  Tell me.
-She isn't opening the door,
[864.72] -I... I am really worried.
-Don't... don't worry, come, come with me.
[869.25] -She isn't opening to door... Aima...
-Aima!
[875.46] Aima...
[878.56] Aima, I'm telling you for the last
time, if you don't open the door, I
[881.87] 'm going to break it.
[884.05] -Aima!
-What is this madness?
[885.86] -Why are you taking the trouble on yourself?
-Auntie I think we will have to break the door.
[889.10] Are you mad?  You will be trapped,
the police are going to arrest you.
[892.23] What the hell are you talking about?
[893.37] If something happens to Aima,
I won't spare anyone.
[895.22] God knows what it is...
[897.98] -Aima!
-Aima, my child...
[903.69] Aima?  Water... Aima!
[906.58] I'm calling an ambulance.  Just see
what's wrong with her, mother, auntie.
[914.79] Aima... Aima... my child.
[921.64] Aima, my child, Aima,
what is wrong with you?
[927.14] Aima, Aima...
[928.35] Aima... Aima.
[931.82] Oh, God!  Zaid...
[934.48] Zaid, call the doctor, my Aima... Aima...
[950.01] Do you know what the doctor said about the reason for
your passing out?
[954.22] What if things got out of hand?
[957.37] Brother, I am just fed up of telling
her, please make her understand.
[965.00] Why didn't you eat yesterday?
[969.72] Dad, actually I wasn't
feeling well, so I skipped dinner.
[975.91] And breakfast?
[977.52] I was getting late for university.
That's why I didn't have my breakfast either.
[984.41] You know how low your blood pressure got?
[987.10] Just because of your stupidities.
[990.70] She just got a little better,
and you started scolding her.
[996.04] Look, dear, no matter how busy life gets,
[1002.32] But you should make such a schedule, that your
priority should be your diet first.
[1008.77] Yes, Dad.
[1011.94] Since her university has started, I don't
think I have seen her having breakfast.
[1019.75] Mother, I'm fine.
You all are getting worried for no reason.
[1024.31] -For no reason?
-You mother is right, dear.
[1027.37] If anything had happened to you, we would have
been so worried, think about it.
[1032.77] Yes, Dad.  I'm really sorry.
I won't let you guys complain again.
[1038.63] -Promise?
-Promise.
[1043.06] Zaid, from now on, it's your duty to take care
of Aima's diet in the university.
[1052.78] Okay, Dad, but please
tell her to listen to me.
[1058.20] Yeah, all right, I haven't asked you
to become her teacher.
[1062.60] Shabana, you have to keep
an eye on her at home,
[1065.61] -I want to know everything about her.
-Yes, brother.
[1068.92] Take care of your health, dear.  Okay?
[1073.19] May God give you health.
I'll go now, you take rest too.
[1078.13] Auntie, you can go rest for a while too.
I'm right here.
[1081.91] No, mother, I have to talk to you about
something, please stay here with me.
[1090.34] Okay.  Okay, Zaid you can go,
I'm here with her.
[1099.79] What is it dear?
[1102.74] -What do you want?
-Nothing, just stay with me.
[1107.21] Idiot.
[1109.91] You should eat, take care of yourself.
[1121.28] What's wrong, Zaid?  Aima is fine now.
Cheer up now.
[1127.71] I can't cheer up
until Aima starts talking to me.
[1131.73] You should say until she forgives you.
[1134.37] -Yeah, same thing.
-What same thing?
[1136.83] These are two different things.
[1138.94] Aima never gets angry with anyone.
[1141.93] Unless the other person does
something really stupid.
[1145.97] And if Aima feels bad about someone, once,
[1150.93] then he lives or dies, she doesn't care.
[1156.60] Zoya, I called you here to support me,
not to torture me.
[1162.03] I have been really stressed as is
for the last few hours.
[1165.61] Okay, I was messing with you.  Just chill.
[1170.23] Chill?  I mean I'm about to die here,
and you're cracking jokes?
[1175.05] Okay, fine, here... apologies.  Okay, happy?
[1181.85] Zoya, do you have any idea how difficult
these past hours were for me.
[1187.89] You know what, Zaid?
[1189.35] Looking at you, it seems
[1190.64] as if someone has taken away the
favorite toy of a stubborn child,
[1193.66] Just look at your face.
[1195.51] Zoya, please shed your philosophy some
other time, go talk to Aima first.
[1200.68] I'll go to Aima in a while,
Shabana auntie is coming.
[1204.04] I don't care, please go, I can't wait.
[1207.60] All right, I'm going.
[1216.97] By the way, Zaid, have you eaten?
[1223.10] -What?  Are you serious?  Since when?
-Since Aima hasn't eaten.
[1228.36] Are you mad?
[1230.19] Come on, get up, let's go to the kitchen,
come on eat something.
[1233.04] I don't feel like it.
[1235.16] Okay then, I'll ask Aima not
to forgive you.  Okay?
[1239.35] Yeah, as if she's going to listen to you.
[1242.01] She listens to me, that's why I'm here.
[1250.04] -Who are these flowers for, for me or for Aima?
-For me.
[1255.48] -They aren't nice at all.
-Really?  Just like your face.
[1258.88] -Why are they for you then?
-Because they are pretty.
[1265.67] The drama queen has made
the whole house chaotic.
[1269.12] What else do they know
other than seeking attention?
[1272.55] I just saw, how all the men of your home
are putting their hearts out for her.
[1277.85] What should I do then?  Run away from here?
[1280.39] Everything is going in
the wrong direction here.
[1285.87] Instead of sending away
auntie and Aima from here,
[1288.48] you are talking about
running away yourself?
[1290.28] Both of them are infested
like termites in our house.
[1295.71] They will leave after
hollowing down the house.
[1298.62] Seeing you this uninterested,
it seems you have given
[1301.51] up in front of your
would-be daughter-in-law.
[1304.13] What are you saying?  Stop this nonsense.
[1305.90] Would-be daughter-in-law?  God forbid.
[1308.36] Didn't you see brother's craziness
for Aima?
[1311.32] Even after knowing something,
you are in denial, then fine.
[1316.13] Whatever, I'm not going to let this happen.
[1318.28] I have heard, when dad was bringing auntie
to this house, you said the same thing.
[1323.80] It was different then.
[1326.08] Mother, be it now or then,
[1328.83] I don't think your opinion matters to
anyone in this house.
[1332.75] You haven't seen the strength of
your mother's decision yet, Nosheen.
[1339.08] Dad, the college is taking us on a picnic,
at a farm house.
[1343.67] -Hmm, when?
-Tomorrow
[1347.44] {\an8}Tomorrow?  They are taking you tomorrow
and you are telling it to me now?
[1351.60] Why did I become unwanted
[1355.73] {\an8}Nobody knows that Why did I
[1360.91] become unwanted {\
[1365.49] an8}Nobody knows that
[1370.36] I am just telling you that,
[1371.96] Aima is going to shift her home,
not her room.
[1375.36] That's more like it.  Now it seems like
you are the owner of this house.
[1379.02] Just stick to what you have just said.
[1381.52] You'll see.  I am giving you my word today, that this will not happen
while I am alive.
[1387.48] Mother, I wanted a favor from you.
[1391.43] Nosheen, whenever you say something like
this, my heart starts palpitating.
[1396.86] Listen to me at least.  Get me
permission from dad, please.
[1401.92] -What for?
-Mother, the college is taking us
[1405.08] on picnic, at a farm house,
it's an over-night stay.
[1409.02] Are you insane?
Your dad is going to kill me.
[1413.22] -Mother, please, please!
-Out of question.
[1418.48] You know that your dad won't allow it.
[1421.56] But why?  All of my friends are going.
[1424.12] Don't insist, Nosheen.  You know your dad
won't allow you to stay outside overnight.
[1429.00] I know, that's why I'm asking you.
Please convince him.
[1435.62] -Please?
-Enough of exploiting me.
[1437.73] Go get the permission yourself.
[1440.29] All right, fine.  You want me to
hear all his scolding.
[1444.22] I haven't denied it,
but you will take permission yourself.
[1447.89] What's this, means you won't support me?
[1450.77] -Who wants to go?
-Me.
[1453.04] Then you are going to talk to him.
[1455.71] Okay, fine, I'll talk to him, but promise
me you are going to convince him.
[1460.25] I'm not going to promise,
but I'll try, okay.
[1467.05] Hello, miss Aima Hassan, how are you doing?
[1470.87] I am perfectly fine.  No need to bring this?
I am not sick.
[1479.40] By the way, I needed it.
[1481.88] These are my favorite flowers,
and they smell so nice.
[1486.74] I know, that's why I've got them.
[1492.05] Thank you very much.
[1493.71] Okay fine, get up.  You are
not sick or anything.  Come.
[1496.58] Where?  Where?  Just wait.
[1498.94] -What?  Let's go.
-Where are we going?
[1502.28] -Do the market, let's roam around.
-I can't go, hold your horses.
[1507.73] I am under surveillance, right now.
Mom, dad, everyone is at home.
[1514.88] Why don't you get it?
[1530.79] By the way, what's going on
between you and Zaid?
[1536.86] I knew it, I knew it very well
that you are going to talk about it now.
[1542.28] Look, I don't want to talk
about it or listen to it.
[1548.52] Aima you are dragging a small issue,
forget it.  Why are you angry at him?
[1555.74] I am not angry at anyone.
[1557.77] If you aren't angry, why is Zaid sitting
there like he is going to choke?
[1564.70] Can we talk about anything else,
other than Zaid?
[1568.10] Are you never going to talk to Zaid?
[1570.46] It's not like that.  I... I'm
going to talk to him, but,
[1575.12] just like a cousin.
He is not my friend now.
[1578.87] Nor do I care about him.
[1588.62] Okay, fine.
[1591.51] You know what?  Zaid hasn't
eaten since you both fought.
[1598.16] -Who told you that?
-Zaid told me himself.
[1601.71] It seemed like he was going to
faint right then.
[1606.11] He has gone so weak.
[1609.19] Is he mad?  Why didn't he eat anything?
[1611.98] You... ask him yourself.
[1614.70] Here... let me call Zaid
here in your room, wait.
[1619.90] Hello, yeah Zaid come to
Aima's room, quick...
[1623.28] Yeah, Zoya, you called me?
[1626.68] -I was getting your call...
-Yes, I called you, I did.
[1632.14] At least you should have listened
to her first, and then entered.
[1642.82] Sorry, sorry.
[1646.09] Yes, Mr.  Javed Iqbal, I know what you
are saying, but there are too many... Typing
[1651.74] mistake is one thing,
[1654.06] but you should be careful as it is a
matter of accounts.
[1657.76] Who is handling it?
[1658.96] Mr.  Darvesh?  Come on.  Tell Mr.  Darvesh
to keep his eyes open while working.
[1666.42] One should re-check 10 times
before giving a quotation.
[1669.23] Okay, fine.  E-mail me, I'll check it then.
Right away.
[1680.97] -Dad, may I sit?
-Hmm, sit.
[1687.16] -What is it?
-Dad, I wanted to take permission from you.
[1692.94] I'm listening, carry on.
[1695.96] Dad, the college is taking us
on a picnic, at a farm house.
[1700.60] Hmm, when?
[1703.40] -Tomorrow.
-Tomorrow?
[1706.50] They are taking you tomorrow and
you are telling it to me now?
[1709.45] Dad, actually I didn't go
to college for so many days,
[1712.37] I got to know about
it now that I went.
[1717.56] -Permission note?
-Dad, I don't have it.
[1721.93] -But I remember everything.
-Tell me?
[1726.28] Dad, they are taking us to a farm house,
and the teachers are going to be with us.
[1731.05] Are just the girls going, or guys too?
[1735.85] Dad, everyone is going,
but teachers are going to be there.
[1741.50] -What time do you have to leave?
-Around 9:00 or 10:00.
[1745.67] Are you going to have
breakfast before leaving?
[1747.90] No, Dad, after dinner.
[1752.17] What do you mean after dinner?
[1754.02] Dad, it's an overnight stay.
[1757.43] Are you insane?  Overnight stay?
[1761.96] I mean how could you even think about it?
[1765.59] Had it been during the day, I would have
considered it, but overnight stay?
[1768.33] There is no question of staying out
all night.  What is wrong with your college?
[1772.17] What kind of programs are they having?
[1774.60] No, Dad, please, don't say
anything in college.
[1778.29] Why not?  We pay them their fee.
[1781.77] -So, Dad, should I refuse?
-You are still asking?
[1786.40] And listen, if there is
anything like this next time,
[1790.68] then refuse it
without even asking me.
[1792.43] -Go now.
-Okay, Dad.
[1813.41] -So, then?
-What, then?
[1817.71] Have you forgiven Zaid or not?
[1826.28] Oh, thank you, Aima, thank you
so much that you have forgiven me.
[1829.51] I was really scared, I swear.  Thank you.
[1832.25] I haven't forgiven you.
I didn't say anything.
[1838.05] Well not saying anything
means partial agreement.
[1840.63] Aima, don't do like this again,
but, thank you.
[1846.19] By the way, he asked me to lie to you.
[1851.63] What lie?  Look here, here.
[1853.90] -What lie?
-Oh, hey?  Which lie?
[1856.46] Well, that he hasn't eaten anything
and he has fainted.
[1860.19] This fat man was having his lunch there.
[1863.19] Zoya!  I swear to God she is lying.
[1867.34] I promise I haven't eaten anything.
[1870.86] Okay fine, it's good that
you have had your lunch.
[1874.88] But I didn't eat anything, I promise.
[1877.58] But you have eaten, haven't you?
[1881.59] She blackmailed me, I ate only then.
[1883.25] She fed me forcefully.  She said if you wo
n't eat I am not going to talk to Aima.
[1888.06] What does her talking to me
have to do with you eating?
[1897.83] Actually...
[1901.62] Actually the things that...
[1904.41] I was the one who called Zoya.
[1910.79] so that she can sort things out between us,
[1913.76] and you have forgiven me!
Thank you.
[1916.46] So, you can go now, it's
all good between us.
[1919.82] Very bad Zoya, you
shouldn't have done this.
[1926.15] You are right, very bad!
[1929.44] Huh?  Wait a second.  Are
[1932.87] you both trying to fool me?
[1938.17] This is how you repay me?
[1941.75] I had to forget my commitments,
[1943.65] to come here for you, to sort
things out between you two, but...
[1948.89] Elders said it right, one
shouldn't make friends.
[1953.22] -I am going to faint.
-Oh, miss, miss.
[1955.67] Okay, Oh, please, now you do
n't get angry with me.
[1958.46] I have other things to do in life.
[1960.10] -No, no, please, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-There's only one solution to it.
[1964.16] -Yes, Yes?
-You have to take us both for dinner.
[1967.87] That's very right.
[1971.47] Okay, done.
[1973.30] But just end this episode
of getting angry, okay?
[1978.53] Hey, threaten her if you want to.
She was the one who was angry.
[1982.98] Listen, Aima.
[1985.57] I'm telling you seriously,
never get angry with me.
[1993.89] Done.
[1999.54] -Zaid, should I tell you something?
-Yes, what?
[2005.55] -Listen to it carefully.
-Yes, yes.
[2011.60] -You...
-I?
[2016.06] -You...
-I?
[2019.28] Are a really bad actor.
[2024.09] -Right!
-Sorry!
[2027.58] -I am going to take on dinner, and I am the bad actor?
-Okay, let's be friends.
[2031.61] Friends, friends... Aima, friends?
[2037.57] -Aima, enough already.
-Yes.
[2049.73] Why did I become unwanted
[2054.34] {\an8}Nobody knows that Why did I
[2059.00] become unwanted {\
[2063.67] an8}Nobody knows that
[2068.97] Well then to prove your friendship, give
me a favor.
[2073.06] -What kind of favor?
-I am going to leave for the farm house in a little while.
[2077.56] Just stay a little longer.
[2078.82] Faisal, don't be silly.  Dad, often wakes
up for early morning prayers, just go now.
[2084.97] If you could just stay a little longer.
[2088.18] Look, I was calling you all night,
but your number wasn't connecting.
[2092.71] Don't you lie to me.
[2095.02] I must admit, you have made a great plan
to trap me in the name of friendship.
[2100.30] Nosheen, what plan are you talking about?
