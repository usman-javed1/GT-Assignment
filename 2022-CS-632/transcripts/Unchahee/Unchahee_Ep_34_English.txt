From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned to chirp from you Aima, as a father I want to say to you that you marry Zaid. Dad, Zoya isn't home.
She has gone somewhere. Her phone is switched off as well. I don't know where she is,
I'm going to look for her. Zaid, don't worry. I know that she must
have gotten this shock. Where is Zaid? Why aren't you saying something?
What's wrong my child? What? You have ruined
everything Azmat, everything. You have destroyed our happiness. This, what we have done. We have hurt
everyone just for the sake of our happiness. Aima, did you have breakfast? Where is Zaid? I don't know. Look, dear, whatever that has happened consider it as your fate. May be all this was
supposed to happen this way. Did you talk to Zaid? Did he say anything? No. -Did he?
-He didn't come to my room. And even if he did, what
would have he said to me? That he is indebted that I have destroyed
his happily married life? Why are you thinking like that? What should I think then?
Haven't I committed a sin? A man has permission to do so. 
He is allowed to have a second marriage. And no one forced him to do so. He said yes for this marriage himself. Whose permission are you talking about? Did anyone take Zoya's
permission before this marriage? No. Her consent was as
important as mine and Zaid's. But the truth is that none of us
three was willing for this marriage. This is a forced relationship
which has been imposed on us. None of us three is going to be happy. Yeah. I know all of this is happened because of me. How are you feeling now? Did you take your medicine? -I'll have it after breakfast.
-Didn't you have your breakfast? -No.
-Why, mother? I was waiting for you. Come lets go and have breakfast. Zoya, open the door.
Zoya please open the door. Zoya, Zoya I just need to talk to
you for a a while please open the door. Zoya, you know I won't leave until
you open the door and talk to me. Just listen to me, Zoya. Zaid, Zaid! No need to create a scene here.
You have got your answer. You may go now. Zoya doesn't want to meet you. Zaid, go from here. I need to talk to you. -I was thinking to talk to you in private or...
-I'll just leave. No, wait, you can say whatever
you want in front of Aima, I don't hide anything from her. Actually, I cam to tell you my decision. And please put your emotions and feelings
aside and think practically about it, okay? I hope you can understand my position,
Zaid, that why I took this decision. And our friendship shouldn't
be effected by it. It's a request. It's okay, you know, you have full right. it's your right to make
whatever decision you make. You can tell me without any hesitation. Zoya, I hope you didn't take
your decision in haste. No I have taken my decision
after giving it a lot of thought. Zoya, you don't need
to give any explanations. Iâ€™m strong enough to face rejection,
please tell me what your decision is. I came to say that... that... I am ready to marry you. Mom... Mom, please, don't do this to me. Don't be angry with me I can take it. It's no use saying all that. You
should have thought of it earlier. Why are you saying that? You are the most important person for me No, Faiq, nothing effects you. If it had effected you, you
would have considered it, but you didn't care about anything. Neither my principles,
nor my upbringing, nor me. Mother, I was compelled to do so. Why, what was your compulsion? Actually Nosheen, I mean
I'm in love with Nosheen... Faiq, don't you get it? What you are calling love is
just attraction towards that girl. She has lured you towards herself. And good women don't have this trait. But still if you want to call
it love then it's up to you. But remember one thing, as
quickly one falls in love like this,  one falls out of it as quickly as well. It doesn't last long. Mother, Nosheen isn't that type of a girl. You are thinking wrong of her. You don't need to tell me
 what kind of a girl she is. I know her very well. She is a very clever and cunning girl, whom I can never respect. You are thinking bad of Nosheen
because you don't know Aima's reality. The reality that I have kept
from you for so many days. I didn't tell you just for
the sake of your happiness. What are you talking about? Mom, you know just one side of the story. Aima already liked Zaid.
She was not interested in me at all. And the one whom you call a quite
natured girl was quite for me only. Don't you dare put such a
bad allegation on my niece. All this is your and Nosheen's smut. You guys want to put all the blame on her
and save yourself from the embarrassment. Mom, I'm telling you it is like that, whether you accept it or not. No, Faiq, she isn't that type of a girl. I trust her completely. You may provide proof against
her but still I won't believe you. You have done a huge
mistake by rejecting Aima. And you are going to realize it very soon. Are you cursing me, Mom? No, Faiq, no mother curses her own child. I hope that what I said proves to be wrong. but this is my experience telling me that the girl you have
chosen isn't good at all. Anyway, I have canceled all
arrangements of your reception and told the guests
that it is called off as well. Whenever you get time
and you find it appropriate invite your immediate family and
do your reception wherever you like. But, Mom... Tell me, Faiq, I want to
know the truth from you. That's true, Mom. I don't like Aima but Nosheen,
and I want to marry Nosheen only. And you are telling this to me now? When you have come here
with everyone to marry Aima? Faiq, you have disgraced me. I have just promised Shabana and
Azmat that my son won't let me down. If Faiq likes Nosheen, then
they both are going to get married. Try to understand this is
going to be unfair to Aima. It is very important for a boy and
girl to like each other to get married. And because Faiq like Nosheen then
Faiq and Nosheen are going to get married. I was thinking that
when I'll propose her, her reaction is going to
be the same as it was yours. What reaction? When we were practicing, at
least you took my proposal serious. And she started to laugh, I mean seriously? It isn't necessary that the way I think about you, 
others do too. I am delighted that you have no
objection on Zaid and Zoya's marriage. -Whose marriage?
-Zaid and Zoya's marriage. Zoya. Zoya, you can open your eyes. I love you, Zoya, will you marry me? How are you doing? How can I be? I know what you are going through. But believe me my child, it was
really important to take this decision. It was the need of the time. Aima, everyone is blaming me. I haven't committed any sin either, Dad, but I am being judged as well. If you will get angry with me too, 
where am I going to go? You are the only one who understands me. With whom I can share my sorrows. Aima, please don't get angry with me. I'm not angry with you. -But...
-Don't be sad, my child. I have taken this decision for
my sister's life and your happiness. My happiness? What happiness, Dad? Do you think I can
ever be happy in my life? Why are you being so hopeless, Aima? Time is the biggest healer. 
Give this relationship some time. I'm sure things aren't
going to stay the same. They will get better with time. I don't know if you have noticed or not, but there is peace of Shabana's
face after your marriage. You won't find that sorrow on her face, the agony that was there when
your marriage got called off. Sorrow and pain are temporary, Dad. No it's not like that at all. Ask the mother whose only daughter's
wedding has been called off in front of her. I think you don't have any
idea what she went through. Her sorrow and pain doesn't
diminish with time. Rather it increases when our
society rejects her only because  her wedding had been called off. What about me, Dad? You decision
has taken away both my friends from me. Zaid doesn't want to talk to me. Zoya wouldn't want to look at me even. Everything is going to be fine, Aima. 
Just give it a little time. Because I haven't done anything
wrong, it's not a sin, I know. I have hurt people, 
but what could be better than this? I had no other option. Whatever I have done, 
I have made God my witness for it. Wow, such a pretty chain. And so heavy. 
Faiq must have got this for Aima. Yeah, he got it for Aima, is mine, I have 
the right on his everything, Mama. Well, that's nice. By the way, Mama, you guys
were so worried about my wedding. See, it's done. It takes just a little time.  And you
all had created just a drama about it. That Oh, the girl had run off from home,
how is she going to get married now? Whether she can find a guy or not? 
See didn't I find one? Okay, okay, I'm well aware of your talent. Tell me what are you going
to wear on the reception? What reception?
There isn't going to be any reception. What do you mean? Means, Faiq just messaged me and told me that my mother in
law has canceled the reception. What? Mama, I had an idea 
that she won't sit quietly. That old woman has completely lost it. But I have set straight so many
people, I'll do it with her too. Just give me some time. Just don't delay your reception. Your friends and relatives should
know that Faiq has married you. Yeah, so what if it isn't happening at this
venue. It will happen at some other venue. That's what I mean. 
Get your reception done quickly. Yeah, don't worry, I'll manage something. I am thinking of selling this
chain and get a new one. No, it's so beautiful 
and design is really nice too. Yeah, but whenever I look a this
chain, I think of that cursed Aima. Oh, wow, you guys are celebrating here. -Amber, you?
-Aren't you ashamed? After destroying my daughter's happiness
you are celebrating here with your daughter? It's not like what you think it is. I
was going to come to you but... Enough now. I have
recognized now how you are. Just sit down, lets talk. 
Go get some water for your auntie. Stop this drama. What's wrong, auntie? 
You are crossing your limit. You shameless person, you are standing here with so much
confidence after disgracing yourself. Don't forget that you 
are present in my home. She is your elder. She may be an elder in her house. All her tantrums are because you
have given her so much leverage. Shameless girl! After doing such a cheap thing you
are still spitting venom in front of me? I thought you won't show
your face for years now. Why would I hide? 
I haven't done anything wrong. I have married with my own choice, 
do whatever one can do. What is even your worth? You disgraced yourself in front of the
whole world and took refuge in my home. Have you forgotten? Even your father denied to
keep you and I took you in. But what did I know you
all are hidden enemies. Yesterday has passed, auntie. 
Look at me today. I am happily married and in my
home and my husband's only wife. Not like your daughter who has
become first wife of someone. Stop it you guys, please. It is you who has spoiled her. She
has done all this on your encouragement. I have seen it today with my own eyes. She has destroyed my daughter's marriage. I did which was right for me. How it
effects others isn't my responsibility. I won't spare you, Nosheen. I won't spare
you all. I am going to destroy your lives. Amber I can understand your pain. Forget about my pain and
prepare yourself for your pain now. Mama, you are giving respect to someone
who doesn't deserve any respect. But Nosheen... Forget it, and consider your
sister as dead from now on. You all are just my enemies now. Oh come one, I have come
across a lot of people like you. I am going to make an example
out of you guys, I won't spare you. Why are you shouting? 
What is all this drama? Oh! You are scolding someone else
when you are the one who is at fault? Then listen, I am shouting because
you have destroyed my daughter's life. And you will have to answer for that. Whatever you need to talk about, 
talk to your sister. Whatever happened, neither I
am responsible for it nor my sister. Is there any shame in you or not? What are you saying, Amber? Why? What do you want now? Should I respect this
shameless person now? Hey you, behave yourself! You are standing in my house
and talking to me in this tone. Don't you know what I can do to you? Try to threaten someone else. Neither am I going to
get scared of your threats, nor am I going to care
about any relationship now. Fine, do whatever you want! You'll see now what
I am going to do with you. I am going to take such a revenge of all the
injustice that have been done to my daughter that you are going to
remember it all your life. Give these empty threats to
some weak and coward person. I am neither coward nor weak. Just wait for your turn now. And your niece and sister, I am going to do that to them that
the whole world is going to watch. Almas! Tell this ill mannered sister of
yours to control herself or else... Don't point your finger. I am leaving myself.
I am not to keen to stay here as well. I am going to see all of you. What is going to happen now? What? Nothing will happen! Just shut up, nothing will happen. We haven't done anything illegal. Whatever we have done, we
have married Zain with his consent. What is going to happen, what... Tell your sister that if she comes
here again and talks non sense,  then I am going to pull her tongue out. Don't know where is Zaid. My phone... My daughter has snatched what
was Aima's, it's all because of her. And we won't be able to
get rid of all this so easily. And I am the one who is suffering 
the most because I have to take decisions. If I ask you something, 
ask something from you, would you say no? Sure, Dad. I hope that you won't say no, Zaid. Dad, tell me without hesitating what I can
do so that we cam get rid of our problems. Zaid, I want you to marry Aima. Okay, tell me one thing. If tomorrow, that girl, Kinza, if she has an issue with our friendship. What are you going to do then? If she has a problem with our friendship?
I'll leave. So, aren't you going to explain
her anything and just leave her? Just listen to me once, just once. I am going to explain you
everything, just pickup the phone. Why did you say yes? Because you proposed me. What kind of answer is this?
Means if I hadn't proposed you  this wouldn't have happened? -What wouldn't have happened?
-This what is happening with us. No, Zaid, of course not. 
This wouldn't have happened. What's wrong? The most difficult time for a mother 
is when she is fixing her marriage. And I think I am anxious about that. Mom, I'm very confident about Daniyal,
and I really like him. And when the marriage is fixed, 
then why not him? I think he is the best option. Thank God, this took
the burden off of me that you are getting
married under my pressure. Mom, if I had taken any pressure I wouldn't have rejected 400
other guys before this one. From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you When life started testing me Where can one hide from his own shadow Why did I become unwanted 
Nobody knows that Not even you know it
Just my Lord knows it The sorrows that I have draped myself in 
Are burning my body I have learned how to burn 
By watching the fire burn Why did I become unwanted 
Nobody knows that Not even you know it
Just my Lord knows it I was thinking that from tomorrow, me and
Faiq are going to eat when you are eating. No need for that. You can eat whenever
you like.  No need to worry about me. What do you mean? 
Why shouldn't we worry? You know, there is
no fun in having food until some elder of the house
accompanies you. And Faiq hasn't eaten properly either. I'm filing a case on Zaid. He is going to come back to his senses
after spending some time in the lock up. What case? Well, he has given you
mental torture right after  and married again without your consent. Just read it, sign it and after that sign here as well. Here. How can this be, Shabana? I have hurt you. I have shown you a
dream about a beautiful, respectful life for your
daughter and then let you down. No you haven't let me down. But I was the one who gave
you my word. I promised you.
