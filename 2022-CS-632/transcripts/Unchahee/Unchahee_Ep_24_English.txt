From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you Amber, why delay this noble task? What do you mean? I mean to say that we won't keep
a very long engagement period. I thought that when I'll propose her, her reaction is going
to be the same as it was yours. What reaction? When we were practicing at least you
took my proposal seriously, and she started laughing, I mean seriously? Nothing is okay. The kind of things going
on in this house, how can anything be okay? -Why, Dad, what's wrong?
-You guys are going to tell me that. Tell me one thing, Zaid. Why did
you keep such a big thing from me? What are you talking about, Dad? What is this, you have come so late.
I've been waiting for you since morning. Sorry, Zoya, even after trying to finish
chores quickly, it took me this much time. It's okay now that you're here. -How did you come?
-I came with Zaid. Was he saying something about me? No, Zoya, nothing special.
He's just waiting for your response. By the way, all things aside,
but torturing him has its own pleasure. His condition right now
is like a fish without water. Aima I just don't believe
that Zaid has proposed me. You should believe it,
Zoya, because that's the truth. Aima I'm really confused,
why did he propose me? What's there to be confused about? He likes you that is why he proposed you. Really? He liked you as well. So me being special here?
I just don't get it. There is a lot of difference
between these to things, Zoya. Tell me, what's the difference? A person likes many people in his life. But marries just one. Whom he not only likes but loves too. So you want to say that Zaid loves me? Yes it is like that. Since when? Has he ever tried
to share it with you? No. He has never told me about it. He has proven to be such a secret lover. And you know that I don't believe in
this love and fairy tale kind of things. So believe in it now.
Why are you delaying? Tell him that you like him too. Excuse me? When did I tell you that? Why? Don't you like him? No, it's not like that
I don't like him, but I have never seen
him with that perspective. It's very complicated. Did brother mean what I have understood? If it is so, I have no objection. I have always like Zaid. And what can be a better
news for me than this that Aima and Zaid get together. But, sister... Aima, tell me what I should do? What does your heart tell you? At times I think that I should get married
to him, he's the best option for me. But at times I think that this is
going to be a wrong decision. What is wrong in it? I don't know. That's why
I have called you here so that you can pick
the best option for me. Why is that so, Zoya? Didn't you choose a guy
for you earlier as well? And you were so confident
about your decision. I had selected him my self, and I would have finalized my decision
after letting him meet you both first. Zoya, you should take such
an important decision yourself. Your own decision should be most important
for you rather than someone else's. Aima, I have always gone with your
decisions and your opinion matters to me. I depend on you on such things. That's why I don't understand whether this
relationship is going to work out or not. Okay, listen, do one thing. Just
close your eyes and ask your heart. Aima, please, all this
happens in movies that close your eyes and if you
see his face he is best for you. Sorry but it doesn't happen like that here. Zoya, just do it, it works. Aima, I want to take a practical decision. Which has got zero emotions and
zero feelings. you know what I mean. Zoya in a relation of love,
emotions and feelings are attached. But I don't want to do all this. I just want to see if marrying Zaid
would be right for me or not. Sorry, I think I said a bit too
much. I didn't mean it that way. Yeah, I know, you haven't
said anything wrong. I hop you get what I meant. Yes I understand that you
don't want to take any risks. But look, Zoya, there is a risk
in every relationship. Okay, tell me, if you were at my place,
what decision would you have taken? I... I would have said yes. You mean to say that I should say yes? Yes. And what's the reason to say yes? Zoya, there are a lot of reasons. You know him since childhood. He is a good person.
He keeps everyone happy. And above everything,
he is in love with you. I mean that Zaid is going to
be an ideal life partner for you. That's my opinion. You have to take the final decision yourself. Please sit, sister. What I need to say can
be said while standing. Yes, what is it? Have you talked to your brother? I don't understand, about what? Shabana, regarding
Zaid and Zoya's marriage. No, sister I haven't talked to
brother regarding this issue. Really? Why is he suddenly
worried about this relationship? Someone must have
said something to him, otherwise he was happy
about it till last night. He was congratulating me happily. Someone must have said
something to him after that. Sister, I have no idea about that. By the way, there aren't many people
in the house who can poison his ears. Do you get what I'm saying? What can I answer you regarding this? Fine, just keep your stance on this issue. Because if I get to know that you
are the one who has mislead him, then you will see what
I'm going to do. Got it? So, what did she say? She is still thinking. What is this, Aima? I sent you
there so that you can convince her. I was expecting a good news. Look, Zaid, I tried to convince
her as much as I could. But after all she has to take the decision. It's not like that, you should have
asked her to say yes by saying anything. You... do you love her so much? Love. Is this what you call love? How would you know,
you've never loved anyone. I know it. I always feel with every
girl that I am in love with her. That's why I'm confused this time. But if you're saying
it then I should agree because you often tell
the right things about me. You call me an open book,
what are you yourself, huh? What is it that's bothering you? I don't know, everything is
happening opposite to my expectations. I was sure that you will convince her but even this expectation
of mine didn't come true. Look, Zaid. As much as I could
convince her, I did it for you. I don't want to force
her to take any decision. But why, what's wrong with that? Look, I want that she likes you
herself and thinks about you herself. If she takes a decision
after liking you then she is going to stay
satisfied with it all her life. Look, even you have taken all your time,
thought over it and then proposed to her. Now it's her turn. Give her some time. If she clears out all her doubts
and likes you and get married to you then it is going to be good for you. And what if she rejects me? Why would she reject you, Zaid? You are underestimating yourself. She has got no valid reason to say no. She is going to say yes. Hello, yes Dad? I'm at home. Yes, she is with me. Everything all right? Okay, fine, good bye. What is it? It was dad. He was saying
to bring you to office along, he has to talk about something important. Since I have given you the phone
you are busy with it. So, what do you want, Mama, what
should I do? Just tell me and I'll do it. Just take a look at the garden, do
some work or take care of the house. Mama, please don't disturb me. And why should I take care of this house? Yes, very right, you've
been sent from the heavens you have nothing to do with this
house. You're always busy with the phone. Good for nothing. What is it, Mama? Why do you
keep taunting me all the time? I keep reminding you of your stupidities so that you won't do
any thing foolish again. You can use the phone later,
it won't go away anywhere. I have to talk to you about something. Go ahead. Have you talked to your dad
regarding Zaid and Zoya's marriage? What is wrong? Why are you laughing
like crazy? Have I told you a joke? I swear, Mama, it was a joke. You are no less than a stand up comedian. Stop this nonsense. Tell me, have you talked
to your dad regarding this? Your husbands keeps hiding from me. He thinks of me as a stranger, 
even after I am his daughter. If you think that I am
going to poison his ears, going to complain about you guys to him, And he is going to say, yeah, dear Nosheen,
only you are wise in this house the rest are just useless. What a joke! You could have said
that in a simple way too. I just had a doubt so I asked. Mama, it's all because of this doubt. 
You guys never stop doubting me. Don't try to act so innocent. Whenever I've 
doubted you I have been proven right. Okay just don't dig out old issues. There are going to be new issues
in this house, just focus on them. I can understand very
well what you want to say. It's good that you understood,
you won't have to cry later. Just leave my home and it's issues alone. Listen to me carefully, don't you dare spit venom 
about this marriage. Neither to me nor to anyone else. Why would I need to
interfere in your problems? Bring your own blood
as your daughter in law. But remember, a confidant of
the house may ruin the house. Just stay away from my problems.
It's my house, I'll handle it myself. Enough now, I forgot what I came to say. Is there still anything left to say? Yes, we'll go to the market tomorrow. 
You are going to come with me. We'll leave at 10:00 in the morning. All right, Mama, I'll be ready. That is if I get up. Actually, the reason
to call you guys here was  that there is a confusion created at home. I just wanted to clear it. Where there is happiness coming to
this house, there is a little sadness too. There is confusion and worries. Regarding what, Dad? Let me tell you. I want that
you both clear it yourselves that you love each other
and want to marry each other. What's is it? Did I say something wrong? Sims, dear, you tell me. What? What, Dad? Do you like Zaid? No, Dad, Zaid is just a good friend and there is nothing as
such going on between us. Means you guys don't like each other? No, Dad... you have misunderstood. And you, Zaid? Do you
have no feelings for her? Dad, I don't understand 
what is this confusion about? Answer me what I am asking you. 
Do you like Aima? Do you want to marry her? Dad, I like Zoya and I want to
marry her. Aima is just my friend. And I don't understand 
what are you confused about? The confusion is that I... Nothing, just leave it. Dad, has anybody said something to you? No, nobody has said anything. Dad, are you unhappy about
my and Zoya's marriage? No, I have no objection. Dad, look if you have any kind
of concern please let me know. Because honestly, I don't want to
take any decision without your consent. Dad, trust me, if you want 
then I won't get married here. No, I'm happy about this relationship. So do I have your permission now? Zaid what is wrong with you? 
Why are you feeling so low? You know, It's been three days. She hasn't
talked to me. No call, no message. Look, where you have waited
for so long, just wait a little more. The decision is going to be in your favor. Aima, how can you be so certain? And why are you so uncertain? Because I know her very well. Has she
every taken a proper decision till now? Neither she has any heart
nor brains. She is totally mad. And you know what? She has no
valid reason for her likes and unlikes. That's why I'm worried. If she declines
me, I'm going to be really humiliated. Nothing of this sort is going to happen.
She is going to accept you, you'll see. Well, I hope. -Zoya!
-Zoya, come, come sit. So, sorry guys, I came at this hour 
and that too without informing. No problem, please sit down. Why are you being so formal. As if
you used to inform earlier before coming. I wanted to talk to you. I was just thinking about
talking to you in private or... -I'll just leave.
-No, wait. Whatever you want to say, you can say it in front of Aima. 
I don't hide anything from her. Actually, I came to tell you my decision. And please keep your emotions and
feeling aside and think practically, okay? I hope you can understand my position, 
Zaid, why I took this decision. And our friendship shouldn't
get effected because of it, Zaid. It's a request. It's okay, you know.
You have all the authority. You know, it's your right
whatever decision you take. And you can tell me without any hesitation. Zoya, I hope you haven't taken a hasty decision. No, I have taken my decision 
after giving it a lot of thought. Zoya you don't need a preamble. 
I am strong enough to face rejection. Please let me know your decision. I just came to say that... that... I am... ready to get married to you. I'm ready. Are you sure? Zoya, I hope you aren't
saying this under any pressure. So, did I surprise you? I just thought you must be grateful, 
I should say yes to you. I mean, you actually have
done a huge favor to me. I am just thinking how am
I ever going to repay you. Thank you. Don't even try. You won't be able to
repay even if your whole life is spent. Just spend your life with me,
you'll get to know then. You wasted such a beautiful line on me? Wasted? Because I am not going to
believe all this what you're saying. Really? Well, get used to it because I am
going to say things like that after marriage. Zaid, I have accepted your
proposal five minutes ago and you are ready for the wedding. You are so desperate for me. Oh, hello, keep your high hopes
to yourself. I wasn't desperate. It's just that I didn't want to stay
stuck in between your yes and now. Really? And what if I had
said no to you straight away? The question is, why
would have you said no? Are you checking his confidence? Madam, why are you asking her? 
She is in my team. What do you mean? Means when I was
confused about your response then my coach, my spiritual guide,
respected madam Aima Hassan gave me the confidence that I
shouldn't underestimate myself. and that I am such a perfect kind of
a person that no girl can say no to me, no. Thank you, Aima. Aima, is he telling the truth? A little. You boast him for no reason. And you, there is no girl in
this world who can say no to me. I was getting my marriage
fixed with someone else  and you entered in between with flowers. You must have thought that you
are going to lose such a pretty girl. I love you, Zoya, please
marry me or else I'll die. You know what, Aima?
I would like you to counsel her. You know, tell her that she is
overestimating herself a little too much. Yeah, please learn something. It was different earlier. Now
your quarrels have become official so I won't come in between them. Well, you never came in between us, but... Look I used to mediate between you
two earlier, but now you both are a couple. Handle your issues yourself. Okay, Zaid, tell me honestly. 
Were you jealous of Daniyal? No, not at all. We both
have no comparison. I am something else
and he is something else. Oh, God, you are so self obsessed. That's because you have 
boasted him so much. She hasn't just boasted me, 
she boasts you a lot too. Yes, you're right, it's all her fault. Exactly, it's all her fault. I am really happy for you both. I love you, Aima. I... I love you too, Aima. 
Really, thank you. Why didn't brother Azmat come? It would
have been nice if he came along with you. I asked him but he said that it will
take time till he returns from work. And we have come casually right now. Otherwise we will come formally
with the proposal, don't you worry. We will celebrate this
happiness to the fullest. Okay, fine. What we'll do is, we will
fix a date in a few days. Till then these kids will be
free with their exams too. Yeah, sure. I have no objection. By the way, 
when are your exams getting over? Auntie, they'll be over this week. And after that they will have to
take a new exam of their lives. You are absolutely right. And this exam is going to be as such that they are going to forget
about the exams at university. So tough. Mom, you are scaring us. Why are you scared? She should have been scared if
she were going to a stranger's house. She is coming to her auntie's house 
after getting married. Why didn't you bring Aima? I asked her a lot of times,
but you know how she is. She just avoided it by making lame excuses. Then you should have forced her to come. She had to stay with her mother
because of her health condition. Zoya, why don't you and
Zaid spend some time together? Why so? Besides me and Zaid 
know each other very well. Even more than a couple knows each other. It's okay that you know
each other very well, but the relationship you
are going to be bonded with you should consider that you guys are meeting
for the first time. Right, sister? I hope 
you've got no objection. I have never stopped them earlier,
why would I have any objection now. Go then, why are you getting
bored by sitting among us? And leave somethings for now. Or else you guys won't have
anything to say or hear after marriage. -They look beautiful together, don't they?
-Yes, by grace of God. Don't tell me Zaid that you
are trying to be romantic. Why not? I have a right
to be romantic with you. It's so strange, that we used to come here a lot too. You're right, it's different. But I would say, it's a good
kind of different. Beautiful. Shall I ask you something? Why did you say yes? Because you proposed me. What kind of answer
is this? Means if I hadn't proposed you this would have never happened? What wouldn't have happened? This what we have among us now. No, Zaid, of course not. 
This wouldn't have happened. -What happened?
-No, I'm just curious. About what? I want to know what you think about me. That you are my cousin, and you
are a very good human being and you are... No, no, I'm not asking about that. Then ask me an exact
question what you want to know. My question is that what did
you think of when you said yes? I mean while taking the decision
what was going on in your mind? Is it that you said yes
just that I don't get hurt? Zaid, do you want to ask me
that whether I like you too or not? No, I mean, I know that you don't believe
in love and affection, etcetra etcetra. But now we are getting into a relationship,
you know a life long relationship. -Should I tell the truth?
-Yes, I want to know the truth. And what if you don't like it, then? I'd still want to know the truth. Zaid, as much as I was thinking about
it, I was getting even more confused. That's why I said yes to you
without thinking about it too much. I'm sorry, Zaid. 
I don't feel anything for you. You are just a friend to me. Neither did I think about
you that way nor do I now. That's why when you
proposed, I just said yes. That I might develop
feelings for you later on. Okay, tell me, did you have similar
feelings when you said yes to Daniyal. One looks for some qualities in a guy
and some in a girl. IF the qualities match only
then can things proceed. That's why there is nothing for Daniyal. So you mean to say that you had
similar feelings for me and Daniyal, which as you said were zero feelings. No, Zaid. Look, I trust you. And besides, I chose you, not Daniyal. And I had some concerns
regarding him as well. What concerns? I have heard that after marriage,
couples fight with each other a lot. They don't stay happy. Then they remarry and they
stop trusting each other as well. But, I trust you. And I know that
you are never going to hurt me. I promise you, Zoya. 
I am never going to hurt you. I just wish that you develop feelings
for me as well the way I feel for you. Don't worry about that, 
I have got a solution for that. -What's that?
-I will start believing in Aima's theory of love. And what's that? That after you get married,
you find everything beautiful. Cool breeze starts flowing. And you fall in love 
with your life partner. I need to talk to you, 
but I don't understand how to start. Brother, you don't need to say anything. I know what you have come to tell me. I am ashamed of you, 
how can I look into your eyes. No, brother, no. Why should you be ashamed? This has been the second time. I have raised your hopes and then
broken them for the second time. Brother, you haven't deceived me. It is called fate but I am unable to understand that
whatever I saw was I mistaken then? Oh, brother, forget all these things. Whatever the children decide, 
just accept it. Yes, we will have to agree as
we don't have any other options. Shabana, I called both of them to office. I asked them directly and they both denied. There is nothing between them. It was my wish that if any one of them
showed interest for the other then I would have talked to them. 
They would have never let me down. I wish they liked each other then... only if... Brother, you did whatever you could do. If this relationship couldn't happen then there must be some wisdom of God in it. You are right. And maybe I am unable to see that wisdom. Brother, I would say regarding this relationship 
I had my doubts too. I didn't feel like telling you about it. Okay, if you want should I
tell you about a proposal? Yes, sister, sure. My distant relatives, they are
looking for a girl for their son. They asked about Nosheen but their son is a little old for Nosheen. So I thought I should ask you. After all Aima belongs to our house too. Meet him once. If you like him, then with God's
will your marriage can be fixed. All right? -Mother.
-Yes? Say yes to auntie on my behalf.
