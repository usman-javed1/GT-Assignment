From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you Don't worry, whatever happens
will happen for good. Okay, let's assume that I
tell you that I love you and want to marry you. I fear that sister is not going to accept Aima
as the daughter in law of this family. Don't worry. Almas has to accept
Aima as the daughter in law of this family. Zoya! I love you, Zoya. Will you marry me? Amber, since you have told me this news my heart is blooming with happiness. I so much wanted
that Zaid and Zoya get together. And God listened to me. And by liking Zoya, Zaid has
proven that he is truly my son. Amber why delay such a noble task. What do you mean? I mean that we are not going to
keep a very long engagement period. Both the kids have completed their studies. And Zaid is going to join office
with Azmat. So why delay it? Sister, Zoya is going to decide that. She is going to tell what she intends. Oh, Amber, I am sure Zoya
wants the same from inside. Besides, she is not going
to any stranger's house. She is going to go to her
aunt's house, so don't worry, I am going to take care of her
even more than you, Amber. Yes, aunty, I'm sure. If I could, I would take
away Zoya right now. But everything seems good
when it's done at it's time. I am at peace now, Amber. Earlier I always used to worry that my
Zaid might get inclined somewhere else. But now something else is revealed. Why, auntie? Did Zaid like someone else? No he didn't, but others tried their best. And I was also scared that he
might get trapped by that witch. Who exactly are we talking about? That Aima. She has
embezzled so many of our rights that I was afraid she might
take away my Zaid from me. Auntie, please think
about what you are saying. What are you saying? You are a kid. You are
not aware of these tricks. Sister, she doesn't know anything. You are right, Amber. She is too naive. Both the mother and daughter
have turned Zaid so much against me that he has shared this
thing with his dad, not me. With uncle? Yes, what was his reaction? He was even happier than me.
I was shocked, he was so happy. Anyways, if Zaid had told me his choice then I would have come properly.
Not just with sweet but other things too. But for now, I have brought sweet only. There is no need for that, in fact
there was no need of this even. All of this happens when
a proposal is given formally. It was needed. It's such a happy occasion. Amber, we are not just
going to be sisters. We are going to become each
other's children's mother in laws. Zoya, here have some sweet. And I am going to eat it with your hands. Here you go. -Have some.
-No, I'm on diet. Okay, let's assume that I
tell you that I love you and want to marry you. Mother is still thinking that Zaid and I... What should I do, oh, God! If I tell her she will be heart broken. She was so happy for me. I can't tell her that. I can't break her heart. I don't understand how
much long will Zoya take to decide? Don't know what she is going to say,
how would the family react to this news? Your choice and happiness
is the most important thing. You should not worry
about what others think. I was thinking that when
I'm going to propose her her reaction is going to be like yours. Which reaction? When we were practicing, at
least you took my proposal seriously. She started laughing, I mean seriously? It's not necessary that the way I
feel about you other's will do too. I mean to say that everybody has a different way of thinking. So, you don't worry,
she is going to say yes. But when? I think I am going to
be restless tonight as well. Zaid, stop torturing yourself. Have a little patience. I'm not torturing myself Zoya is doing it. Is it Zoya? Check it, pick it up, hurry up. -Hello Zoya, how are you?
-Speaker, speaker. Where are you right now? I... I'm in my room. Okay, tell me one thing,
Zaid isn't with you, is he? No, he must be in his room. Why what is it? No, I mean he isn't
anywhere near you, is he? -No, no.
-Oh, thank God. Listen, only you can solve my problem.
I'm badly stuck. Zoya, why are you getting worried?
You're so lucky. See, two boys at the same
time are willing to marry you . This isn't luck but confusion. And only you can save me from
this problem. You'll have to guide me. Aima, I don't even buy a
shirt without your opinion, and this is such
a huge decision of my life. Okay, relax, relax. Tell me what is your confusion? Actually... no, no, I can't tell
you this over the telephone. Just come to my place, okay.
And tell me what should I do? Okay, what I'll do is,
I'll come to your place tomorrow. Okay, please come. And listen,
don't tell Zaid about it, okay? All right, okay. Thank you, and see you tomorrow. Okay, bye. Aima, please convince her some how
to marry me. I'll do whatever you want. Zaid I don't want anything. If Zoya follows my advice,
she is going to say yes to you. Zoya! Dad, everything all right?
You called us at this hour? No nothing is all right. The things that are going on in this
house, how can everything be all right? -Why, Dad? What happened?
-You guys are going to tell me that. Tell me one thing, Zaid. Why did
you keep such a big thing from me? What are you talking about, Dad? You like a girl, and you have
hidden it from your elders. Why are you looking at her? Talk to me. Actually, Dad, what happened was... You don't need to worry. In fact you should be happy. I have no objection on
your choice. I'm really happy. Dad, seriously? What's wrong with that?
The girl is well known to us. Come, come. I was pulling your son's leg. You ought to do that in such matters. We thought of him as a kid, but he
has proven to be a hidden warrior. Before I started looking for girls for him,
he has made things easy for us himself. Yes, you should be happy.
He has solved your problem. Yes, I'm really happy. After all he
has chosen the girl of my choice. What can be better than this? If you are okay with this relationship,
then all the problems are solved. Of course why won't I be okay
with it, after all it's my son's choice. Well then let the celebrations begin
in this house as soon as possible. It's been so long that such a
happy occasion has arrived here. You just leave it to me. Where is Shabana, we should
share the good news with her too. I have called her, she
must be here any moment. Listen, can't you keep
anything to yourself? I haven't told anyone anything. I'm really happy that you have no
objection on Zaid and Zoya's marriage. Whose marriage? Zaid and Zoya's marriage. Brother, I don't understand, 
whatever sister said... Shabana don't you worry, please. Whatever has happened just
now was a misunderstanding. So trust me. I know that Zaid likes
Aima not Zoya, and Aima likes Zaid too. Did Zaid tell you himself? I have see Zaid
confessing his love to Aima. That's why I'm confident. Whatever I've said, I have
said it after because I know. At first, I just expressed what I wanted. And asked time for Zaid's consent. Zaid has made his choice. I'm satisfied. And I'm saying yes to you from my side. Aima is a very nice daughter. I'm sure she will prove herself to be
the best wife and daughter in law too. She has all the qualities
which complete a woman. She knows how to
make a home better. She has the sense of
taking care of her relations. If she becomes the
daughter in law of this house,  I'm going to be really proud of that. Yes, brother, I know it very
well how much you love Aima. -But...
-Don't start again. Let go of all your fears
and doubts, Shabana. When I'm telling you that Zaid and
Aima like each other, they love each other then end of discussion. I haven't misunderstood anything. Perhaps Almas is misunderstood something. That is why she took Zoya's name with Zaid. Maybe this is Amber's or her wish. But the reality can't be hidden
because of that because he likes Aima. Yes, brother, I wish that happened. Shabana, don't worry, have some patience Trust me. I am going to fulfill 
what I am promising this time. With God's will. -Zaid, you proved to be a hidden warrior.
-What do you mean, Mama? You have worked so secretly that you
didn't even let anybody know about it. One keeps what's in his heart to himself. To tell you the truth, I've always
been confused about your choice. I was confused myself, Mama. -What?
-Nothing, you tell me, what were you saying? At times I felt like you
were after Aima, and at times I felt like you were
bringing someone new to home. It's not like that, I'm not after anybody. But I don't know, with Zoya it
just felt right so I proposed her. That's the best thing you've done. There
is no better option than Zoya for you. Why? Because she is your niece? Obviously, but also because
she is someone's only daughter. No hassle with brothers and sisters in
law, and no new dramas every other day. Look, when Zoya will come to
our place, we will be her only family. And all her focus is going to be on us. If that's the criteria then
Aima is the best in this regard because even her home is this as well. Stop talking about useless things. I'm just replying to what you just said. It's very beneficial if someone is an
only child, Zaid. Don't you know that? -Really? How?
-Like the matters of inheritance. Son, I'm really happy that you are
getting a daughter in law of my choice and I'm happy about the fact that you have
taken a well thought decision about it. I didn't think about it so much, Mama. 
It just occurred to me and I did it. And honestly, I'm confused
myself if I should have done it or not. Okay, now stop this nonsense. We're happy and you
should be happy too, all right? Yes, I'm happy. In fact, mostly because of dad.
Because I wanted that dad gets happy. All I wanted was that whatever decision I
take, dad should have no objection over it. Okay, now just decide the dates for
wedding, because I can't wait anymore. Mama, tell me one thing. You are
celebrating and distributing sweets, has auntie told you that Zoya has agreed? Oh, who would say no to my son? Because her consent is
very important as well, Mama. She asked me for some time to
let me know about her decision. She needed some time to think,
and she hasn't answered me yet. Oh come on. Taking time to
think all of it are dramas that girl do. If she wanted to say no
she would have said it earlier. Just think positive and
stop worrying, all right? Well if you think that's how it is
then I should stay positive as well. Exactly. Zoya! Zoya you can open your eyes now. I love you, Zoya. Will you marry me? Aima, what are you doing here all alone? I came for a walk 
so just stopped for a while. I like to look at the stars 
under the open sky. Why don't you stay
here for a while with me? What happened, mother? Why are you worried? What are you hiding from me? No, I'm not worried. And why would I hide anything from you? I am observing you since many days. I want to understand and ask from you that what is it that is bothering you? But whenever I tried to ask you avoided it. What ever is going on in the house, I can't understand what the truth is. Don't worry, 
whatever is happening is right. You're right. But, Aima... tell me the truth. Does Zaid like you? Who told you that? Zaid and me are good friends. And Zaid likes Zoya. And who do you like? Mother, what's wrong with you? 
What are you talking about? I have asked a question. Answer me. Mother, I like Zaid just like a friend. All right. If that's the case then why do you have tears in your
eyes when there marriage is fixed? I don't know, I get emotional
on small things these days. But if I'm crying it doesn't mean
at all that I am in love with Zaid. -Shall I say one thing?
-Yes? Dear, I have been through
this age that you are in. I am well aware of
the condition you are in. Look, dear, it isn't wrong to love someone. It is human nature to love someone. But dear, it is better that you
handover your choice to God. Just accept his decisions. Dear, I always pray to God that may God does what is better for you. Even if you want it or not, if it is in form of Zaid or someone else. You are getting worried for no reason. And I have no complains with God. He must have written
something better for me. My dear, do you know, you are my courage. I get the courage to fight with
the situations when I look at you. You are my strength. You're my brave girl. Because I have taken after you. I had never thought that such 
a happy occasion will come so suddenly. But along with that there
comes a responsibility as well. We will have a daughter in law in our
house. A new family is going to be built. Oh, I just... So much is going
on in my head, I just don't know... And I don't understand if we
should directly get them engaged or shall we decide 
a date and get them married. And I am going to get 
the upper portion renovated. What do you say? We'll see. What happened? 
What do you mean by we'll see? We will have to decide now so that
we get the renovation started upstairs. What's wrong with you? You were in
such a good mood and now you are not. I have to talk to you 
about something very important. Before you say something to me, 
I want to say something to you. By being a part of Zaid
and Zoya's happiness you have proven that
you have actually changed. That is where peace is. Our happiness
lies with our children's happiness. How have you decided it
yourself that Zaid likes Zoya. what do you mean?
Aren't you happy about it? You didn't answer me. I don't understand what has
happened to you suddenly?  You've just changed. What happened? Forget about me, tell me who
told you that Zaid likes Zoya. Who started all this? To me it seems like a wish which
either Amber has expressed or you have. Neither is it my wish nor Amber's. 
It's your son's wish. You must have misunderstood
something for sure. What do you mean, which misunderstanding? Amber had called me to tell that Zaid has
proposed Zoya and he wants to marry her. How can this be? It's just impossible. What is impossible in that? Both are cousins. They were friends
before and started liking each other.  And now they want to marry each other. What's there to be surprised about? No, no, no. I don't think that Zaid likes Zoya. What difference does it make what you
think, the truth is in front of everyone. Look, I'm telling you once again,
you must have some misunderstanding. There has been no misunderstanding. Have you talked to Zaid about it? I am just coming from Zaid's room. Azmat,
he has told me exactly what Amber told me. that he has proposed Zoya
for marriage. So has he agreed that he likes Zoya? Zaid has told me what Amber told me that he has proposed Zoya
he wants to marry her. And Zaid has proposed her
because he wants to marry her. Why would you propose
someone if you don't like someone? I don't understand why don't
you believe on what I'm saying. -What is the problem?
-Problem... There isn't any problem. The problem is that I'm sleepy. What a joke. Both the homes have started
celebrations and madam is still not sure. I know it, Zoya. I know
you're just messing with me. You're playing with me. Is the marriage fixed? Consider it almost fixed. Few things need to be
finalized and then a function. And we are going to have a grand function. I have told you such an exciting
news, Nosheen and you're not happy? So what do you want? Shall I dance over it? Nosheen, why do talk so
sarcastically and bitterly? Sorry to say but I don't see any wisdom
behind this useless decision of yours. And you're some genius
who knows what lies in future? Look, Nosheen, if you
can't do anything else then just shut up and just be
happy in your brother's happiness. If he doesn't even consider me as his
sister, why should I celebrate his wedding? Nosheen don't be
negative about everything. You are bringing your niece in
this house and happy about it. Yeah, why shouldn't I?
My sister's daughter is becoming the daughter
in law of this family. Mama, you are having false hopes. Your sister's daughter is
going to create trouble for you. You are going to face tough times. I'm telling you, 
your daughter's sister is very cunning. Don't get her married
to Zaid, I'm telling you. It would be better that you
get him married to Aima. At least she is going to be harmless. And your sister has got such sharp nails that she is going to
scratch the whole house. Just stop this nonsense. You keep
uttering nonsense with your cursed tongue. Say something nice for once, Nosheen. A bitter truth is better
than a sweet lie, Mama. And you know it, I don't lie. Don't you know how that girl is? 
I have stayed with her. She wasn't polite even at her home.
You should forget about it here then. And I'm telling you, if she doesn't
make you cry in the first few days,  you can change my name. Don't come to me crying then. Listen, you don't need to worry much. I know it very well why
you are saying all this. Oh, really? So you think I'm jealous of her
because she is getting married before I am? What else. Okay, fine, do as you like. 
I was talking about your benefit. I don't need your help. I can
take care of my house, okay? You weren't able to take
care of your house till date. And what do I care?
I was just wandering you. It's between you and your son now. What do I have to do with
it. If not today then tomorrow I am going to marry and
go away from this house. Just pray that you get a proposal.
Because what you have done, nobody makes such a girl
the honor of their home. Wow, Mama, means you
have said it in hidden words that you don't have any
hope of me getting married? By the way, there are so many people
in the house who can poison his ears. You do get what I'm saying, don't you? What can I answer you about this? Okay, just keep you stance on this matter. Because if I get to know that
you are the one misleading him, you're going to see then
what I am going to do, got it? Where there is happiness coming to
this house, there is a little sadness too. There is confusion and worries. Regarding what, Dad? Let me tell you. I want that
you both clear it yourselves that you love each other
and want to marry each other.
