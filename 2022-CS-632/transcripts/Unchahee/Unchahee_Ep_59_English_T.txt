[0.08] From flowers and from buds
[4.64] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.23] When I saw you
[14.17] I learned how to chirp from you
[19.51] I want that you...
[23.57] divorce me.
[28.53] -Greetings, auntie.
-Greetings, I am so happy to see you.
[32.91] Didn't you miss us since so long?
[35.44] Missed you all a lot, that's why I'm back.
[39.05] How are you doing, Dad?
[39.98] Look, please don't start that
again. I'm already too tired.
[44.41] If Sania had messaged you right now
then you wouldn't have been tired.
[47.74] Oh, shut up, Nosheen,
what are you saying?
[49.83] I'm saying the truth.
[51.08] You aren't even happy about our
kid, you are concerned with him at least.
[54.74] I know that you haven't forgiven me.
[57.72] How can you say that?
[61.09] Because I am unhappy.
[66.88] I am unhappy even after trying so hard.
[68.84] If you don't get happiness through
a relationship, then you should end it.
[76.90] And at times one has to break the
relationships for others' happiness too.
[101.88] Zaid has asked me to leave his home.
[105.41] -How dare he ask my daughter to...
-He is very daring.
[110.00] He is sending a notice in few days too.
[113.19] What notice?
[114.38] You are pretending to be so
innocent as if you don't know anything.
[188.22] What's wrong, Nosheen?
Why are you sitting like this?
[193.38] I thought to make breakfast for Faiq,
[197.30] so, when he woke up and went to
the washroom, I went to the kitchen.
[200.25] Okay, then?
[204.07] I made breakfast for him with so
much difficulty early in the morning,
[206.76] and he left without even telling me.
[210.00] Oh, Faiq did very wrong.
[215.25] but you should have told him, and
maybe he had something important to do
[220.43] that's why he left without telling.
[223.17] Auntie, he knew that I
was in the kitchen,
[225.53] he could have at least
told me before leaving.
[227.95] Anyway, don't lose heart.
[229.95] I thought he will be happy by seeing it.
[233.16] Let him know in the evening, he will
get happy even by listening about it.
[237.56] You know what? I have been angry
a lot of times on what people said,
[241.97] but I have never got hurt
by listening to anyone.
[247.44] Neither had I ever tried to please
anyone but I was still happy.
[253.12] And now when I'm trying to please someone
[259.41] then I am the one getting hurt,
why is it like that?
[263.11] Because now you have
started caring about people.
[270.97] And this is the beauty of a human
[272.86] that his good deeds start
taking over him gradually.
[276.88] It is a little difficult in the beginning
but later on you will feel so good
[283.30] when everyone is with you.
[284.94] So wasn't I good earlier?
[287.63] When did I say that?
My daughter is the best.
[294.20] It's just that the feeling of caring
about others has aroused now in you.
[299.39] I made breakfast with such
difficulty and all of it is wasted.
[304.36] Why will it be wasted? If my daughter
has made it I am going to eat it.
[308.06] Bring it quickly.
[309.57] No, this has turned cold, I'll
make fresh breakfast for you.
[315.38] No, sit with me, I have to talk to you.
[319.09] You know, I thought that with
Faiq I'll make breakfast for you too.
[325.02] Really? Means now I
am going to get breakfast
[328.82] daily made by my
daughter along with Faiq.
[332.87] I can try to make it daily,
[335.69] but I can't promise that.
[337.49] No, dear, no need to make it daily either
[340.41] because I wanted that together,
we take care of you only,
[344.63] and you need our care too.
[347.08] Yes, but I have some duties too.
[351.43] There is a lifetime to do all this.
[357.21] Besides, you will have to
take care of Faiq after me.
[360.38] Please, don't say that,
you are my only friend.
[367.26] And Faiq is also tolerating
me just because of you,
[370.73] otherwise, he would have asked
me to leave the house long ago.
[373.60] It's nothing like that.
[376.73] He is little stupid,
that's why does mistakes.
[383.19] But once he understands,
he won't do anything like this.
[386.64] But still, I want you
to be with us always.
[390.73] Ya, okay, Iâ€™m not going
anywhere right now. Just don't worry.
[396.77] But may be Asim is going to
call me to Canada in a few days.
[400.42] I'll have to go there.
[402.11] No, you aren't going anywhere.
Say no to Asim.
[405.49] I won't let you go anywhere from here.
[408.91] Oh, I'm not going right now,
[412.46] but, Nosheen, I'll have
to go to him in a few days.
[415.78] No, I'm going to talk to Asim myself.
[420.94] I won't let you go. And if he misses
you so much, he will come here.
[425.26] You are not going to leave us.
[426.95] Okay, fine, I'm not going anywhere,
I am here with you, happy now?
[436.63] Pick it up, who is calling?
[441.18] Hello? Yes, brother. I'm
good, how are you doing?
[449.34] Brother, please try to
understand, I am at my in laws.
[452.81] I can't come whenever
I want at at any time.
[457.79] What's wrong? Let me talk to him.
[466.33] Hello, greeting, how are you doing?
[474.69] I'm good too. Don't worry, driver will
drop her as soon as Nosheen gets ready.
[485.23] Really? Sure do come over,
it's like you own home.
[491.29] Fine, I'll tell her to get ready. Okay.
[496.52] So bad, he is calling you with so
much love and you are saying no.
[501.76] Here. He is coming to pick you.
Get ready nicely and then go.
[507.38] But you haven't eaten
anything since morning.
[509.14] I'll bring some fruit for
you then you may go, okay?
[536.27] No, Aima, at times there is
no solution to some things.
[542.09] And if there is a solution, a person
becomes really helpless at times.
[548.40] I know it very well.
[551.07] We all have put a lot of
pressure on you, right?
[563.10] I, I want that
[568.26] you divorce me.
[586.82] Auntie, Faiq's number is switched off.
[590.82] Nosheen, he might
have stopped over with his friends.
[596.18] Yes but his phone is off, auntie.
[601.28] Yes, that's worrisome.
[603.36] But may be he didn't charge his phone.
[606.62] I am getting really worried.
[609.79] Don't worry, he will be here in a while.
[613.45] Auntie, if you hurt someone intentionally,
[619.13] will you ever be able to stay happy?
[622.20] It is true,
[624.32] that the one who has hurt someone
is always rebuked by his conscience
[627.92] and he never stays at ease
[634.37] until the other person
doesn't forgives him by heart.
[637.94] Even God doesn't forgives
him till then, Nosheen.
[642.28] What is it? You look tensed,
what's going on inside you?
[647.26] Auntie, I have always
hurt Aima intentionally.
[656.60] If I will ask for her forgiveness,
will Faiq be okay with me too?
[662.30] No matter if anything
else gets okay,
[664.16] but asking for forgiveness
often satisfies the heart.
[672.62] If you think that way,
you can apologize to her.
[680.01] Will Aima forgive me?
[683.07] If you sincerely ask for forgiveness
she will definitely forgive you.
[690.42] Faiq's calling.
[693.50] Hello, Faiq.
[695.60] Who is this?
[697.44] Who are you? This is my husband's number.
[701.15] -Your husband has met an accident.
-What? How? How is he doing now?
[719.34] Nosheen, who was it?
[726.00] Who was calling?
[729.48] Nosheen, at least tell me something.
[741.59] MY daughter's life is ruined.
[744.40] She has to face so much sorrows.
[747.60] Auntie, please be strong.
[749.73] Look, if you are going to do that,
who is going to take care of Nosheen?
[754.91] Aima, how is she going to bear so
many responsibilities at such a young age?
[762.07] We all are here to take care of her.
[765.01] Yes, but...
[767.80] Yes but before her child could be born the
father of her child has left the world.
[774.17] This is what God wanted.
[777.38] We all are helpless in front of Him.
[784.77] What else can we do
other than being patient.
[787.42] But Azmat, she is so young,
how is she going to do all this?
[793.30] If God has put her in a trial then
He will definitely find a way for her too.
[799.59] Oh God! What is this trial
that you have put us in?
[804.19] Oh God! Give Nosheen patience, 
give us patience.
[809.20] What is Nosheen doing?
[810.94] She is sleeping, Dad.
[813.02] Give her something to eat,
[814.70] she is in her home for two days
and hasn't eating anything properly.
[818.25] Yes, I gave her breakfast.
[821.35] Neither she is eating or drinking, 
nor she is saying anything.
[825.54] Has Nimra eaten anything? I
am trying but she is crying all the time.
[831.55] I am unable to handle her.
[837.35] And Nosheen, neither
she is crying nor talking.
[843.78] God will have mercy.
[846.90] You keep crying,
[850.77] think of that mother whose
grown up son is taken away,
[852.38] what must she be going through?
[854.59] What is her purpose of life now?
Your daughter still has a reason to live.
[860.29] Just have patience.
[863.28] Have patience.
[868.52] Oh Lord, give us patience.
[886.71] I was looking for you in the whole house.
[890.22] When did you wake up?
[894.87] Come on now, eat something right away.
[899.44] I am not hungry.
[901.41] Nosheen, why aren't you hungry?
It's very important for you to eat.
[908.97] If not for yourself, then fro your child.
[916.04] And look, how rough your hair have gotten.
[919.44] Come on, get up, get fresh, take
a shower, I will iron your clothes, okay?
[925.92] -Aren't you angry with me, Aima?
-Why would I be angry with you, Nosheen?
[930.88] You know, I have always
deliberately given trouble to you.
[937.02] I have always teased you deliberately.
[940.85] I even took away Faiq from you.
[943.56] But you know, Aima? 
Faiq has never become mine.
[951.98] Because even if you take away something
from someone, it doesn't become yours.
[957.82] Faiq had never loved me, Aima.
[962.65] I am telling you the truth.
[966.31] Nosheen, stop now. 
All this is in God's hands.
[970.87] -Just don't...
-Yeah, you're right.
[976.08] God as punished me.
[982.41] He has shown me that I am worth nothing.
[990.02] No matter how much I want something,
it can't happen until He wants it.
[996.64] No doubt.
[998.83] God is our Lord.
[1015.01] A lot of Faiq's friends are calling.
[1018.13] I have told them that auntie is
going to stay at our place for a while.
[1022.32] You did right, besides it's not right for
her to stay at her home  in this situation.
[1029.77] Zaid, I was thinking that you
[1033.16] did the right thing to tell me that
dad wants me to get back home.
[1037.12] If you hadn't told me I
wouldn't have known.
[1040.12] Actually he asked for you
twice so I thought of telling you.
[1044.48] Thank you.
[1047.10] Zaid, may I ask you something?
[1051.34] Sure.
[1053.27] Are you okay?
[1055.23] Yes, absolutely.
[1058.02] Zoya wanted to talk to you, 
but you were busy.
[1061.33] who told you that?
[1063.63] Zoya was saying that you are ignoring her.
[1067.12] It's not like that, 
actually I was also a bit busy.
[1071.65] Zaid, what do you want?
[1073.41] Why are you doing this? 
Why are you doing all this.
[1078.36] What?
[1080.56] Don't play with your life, Zaid.
[1083.02] Just take a decision and decide
what you want to do with your life.
[1088.48] One who is going through
it, only he knows
[1090.94] how difficult it is to take 
a decision in some situations.
[1093.81] I know it is difficult for you.
[1095.87] But Zaid, for everyone's peace
you will have to take a decision.
[1102.75] You are right.
[1105.48] I might divorce Zoya.
[1108.59] Or maybe I'll have to leave Aima.
[1113.66] What kind of an answer is this?
[1115.99] This is what I am feeling like.
[1119.38] Zaid what is it that you want?
[1123.84] I don't even know it myself
now what I actually want.
[1129.39] I don't understand, how
are you going to decide then?
[1133.72] What will your decision be based on?
[1137.43] May be Aima wants it, 
or may be the family wants it.
[1141.78] But I...
[1145.94] Zaid, listen, you are too confused.
[1151.56] But remember what I'm saying,
[1153.74] Whatever decision you take,
please don't take it in haste.
[1161.69] Either I take a decision in haste or
take my time, I have to take a decision.
[1168.70] I'm with you.
[1187.47] Nosheen must be so worried and so lonely.
[1191.98] And now she has a
responsibility of a child too.
[1195.37] And mother's problems are increasing too.
[1200.08] I shall go to Pakistan.
[1202.54] And I shall own the
responsibilities of Faiq.
[1206.76] I think I shall take this step
[1209.95] because this will solve a
lot of problems of my family.
[1214.56] Yes , I shall do that.
[1217.79] Mother has said yes, 
she is happy about it.
[1221.68] But will Nosheen be able to accept it?
[1226.51] Will she be able to accept me?
[1228.94] Because it is my decision.
[1231.12] Will she support me in this decision?
[1234.70] Because, there are a lot
of issues in the society.
[1239.42] May God have mercy, that
my decision proves to be right.
[1257.38] -Hello, how are you doing, mom?
-I'm fine, Asim.
[1262.01] I know, Mom. 
Till when are you going to cry?
[1265.85] Don't know, Asim.
[1268.21] These tears aren't going
to leave me until I'm alive.
[1272.38] I know that you are in too much pain.
[1276.34] But we all are going through the same
pain, still we will have to have patience.
[1281.30] Otherwise, brother's soul will get hurt.
[1283.77] I am having patience.
[1286.60] A mother is still alive even
after her grown up son has died.
[1290.35] This is patience.
[1292.13] Mom, do one ting
[1294.79] Please come here as soon as you can.
[1298.77] No, Asim, how can I come right now?
[1302.94] What about Nosheen? She is alone here.
[1307.09] Who is going to give her
courage and console her?
[1309.88] How is she doing now?
[1313.09] How can she be?
[1315.68] My daughter is completely broken.
[1320.43] I can't bear to see her pain, Asim.
[1324.39] She is so young. How is she
going to spend her lifetime?
[1329.46] At least get hold of yourself for er, Mom.
[1332.19] Asim, I'm fine. 
I'm not worried for myself.
[1336.43] I'm just worried about Nosheen.
[1339.34] God must have some plan regarding her.
[1342.93] She is so young, anybody can marry her.
[1346.17] Yes, dear, but this isn't so easy.
[1350.34] Because in our society, 
a widow and that to with a kid,
[1355.82] nobody accepts her.
[1358.52] I pray for her every moment
that may God makes her life easy.
[1363.57] May He becomes her best support.
[1366.47] Amen.
[1368.66] Because now she will have to take
care of Faiq's responsibilities as well.
[1372.49] Amen, amen.
[1375.66] Mom...
[1378.23] -Can I ask you something?
-What is it?
[1383.12] -You want me to get married, right?
-Yes.
[1388.34] Okay, if I
[1391.35] want to take brother's responsibilities,
will you ave any objection?
[1398.88] Do you mean
[1401.45] you want to own Nosheen and her child?
[1405.41] Yes, yes Mom.
[1407.09] I'm really sorry if you didn't like it.
[1409.89] No, Asim, why wouldn't I like it?
[1413.32] You have taken off burden from my heart.
[1418.47] I was thinking about
it since so many days.
[1421.66] I just didn't know how to ask you that.
[1429.48] But, tell me one thing, Asim,
[1432.83] I hope you are not saying it due
to any pressure, do you mean it?
[1437.53] No, Mom, Faiq was my brother.
[1440.62] What can be more for me than
taking care of his responsibilities?
[1444.58] Stay blessed, stay happy.
[1447.84] Thank you, Mom.
[1450.57] Bye.
[1496.46] I have got the notice.
[1500.00] Just tear it and throw it away.
[1504.65] I have decided to divorce Aima.
[1507.55] Why are you leaving her, Zaid?
[1511.55] Just because I don't like her?
[1513.99] Or because I am going to
be the mother of your child?
[1518.95] If that's the case then
[1523.45] I lied to you.
[1532.31] I'm not expecting.
[1544.42] Did you lie then or are you lying now?
[1549.76] I know that when a person
breaks someone's trust then
[1556.66] he can never trust him again.
[1563.27] I was never pregnant.
[1568.68] If you want you can get my tests done.
[1572.66] Such a huge fraud? Why, Zoya?
[1576.43] Sorry, Zaid.
[1579.21] I don't have the answers
to your questions.
[1585.38] This was a small try just
to take Aima out of your life.
[1590.98] What do you expect? Am I going
to forgive you after this nonsense?
[1600.44] This mistake isn't forgivable.
[1607.42] I deserve to get divorced only.
[1611.90] I am going to my mom's,
just send me the papers.
[1620.12] I will sign them.
[1651.40] Auntie, did you offer your prayers?
[1654.73] -Yes, I am just reciting Tasbeeh.
-Okay, then let's go have lunch.
[1659.15] No, Nosheen, I just had breakfast.
[1662.87] I don't feel like eating.
[1664.63] Auntie, if you won't eat
then I won't eat either.
[1669.48] You go eat my dear.
[1672.27] I am feeling weird, my heart is sinking.
[1675.65] I don't feel like eating anything.
[1678.03] I can understand your feeling.
[1681.51] Both of our pain is the same.
[1685.16] Yes, of course.
[1689.14] But your sorrow is much bigger than mine.
[1695.37] May God make it easy for
you and gives you courage
[1700.39] to bear this sorrow alone.
[1703.25] I am not alone, auntie.
[1705.94] You are with me.
[1708.86] Yes, Nosheen, I'm with you.
And I'll always be there.
[1714.43] But now I want to go home.
[1717.90] Yeah okay, let's go home.
[1720.79] Besides, I don't feel like staying here.
[1724.01] At least Faiq's memories are there.
[1726.86] But what are you going to do there?
[1729.32] You should stay here with your parents.
[1732.15] What do you mean?
[1735.24] That is my home. Why will I stay here?
[1739.22] The reason because of which it was
your home, he isn't in this world anymore.
[1743.48] What are you saying, auntie? 
That's my home.
[1747.65] And, so what if Faiq isn't
there. You are there with me.
[1752.95] Just think over it.
[1755.73] Nosheen, your life
isn't going to be as easy.
[1759.63] I have no objection if
you want to stay here.
[1765.38] Not at all, I can't leave you alone.
[1769.38] We both will spend our lives together.
[1785.30] But Nosheen is my
responsibility more than you.
[1788.32] And I have talked to
Asim in this regard as well.
[1792.91] I didn't get you.
[1794.39] Actually, Asim wants to
own Nosheen with her child.
[1803.19] Zaid, if I assure you
[1807.59] that Aima won't stay alone, then?
[1810.30] Will it be easier for
you to take a decision?
[1817.32] Nimra has asked your
hand in marriage for Asim.
[1822.12] What is wrong with you
guys? It is my life,
[1825.77] and you didn't even find it
necessary to even ask me?
[1828.58] Yes, Asim has said it himself to Nimra.
[1830.90] Asim is my brother in law.
[1833.16] Don't you guys even have
any regard for relationships?
[1835.64] The reason because of which that
relationship existed, he isn't there anymore.
[1838.43] Zoya, come with me, I am here to take you.
[1841.81] But...
[1843.63] No ifs and buts, no questions.
[1846.71] Come with me.
