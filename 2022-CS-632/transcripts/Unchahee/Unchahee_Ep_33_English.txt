From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you Zoya, what's going on?
Where has everyone gone? I don't know, they have gone inside. I think auntie needs to talk to
them about something important. Okay, just don't worry. It must be
something, I don't know about it right now. Tell them Faiq how much you love me. Tell them that you used to come
and meet me by ignoring Aima. Tell them that we have met
privately at your place and at my place. I'm not going to let anybody
be unfair to Nosheen. And Nimra, you were just
talking about asking Faiq, right? I just met him and he
has admitted it himself that he wants to marry Nosheen. I don't care what you want. If you have fixed your marriage with
Aima, then you have to marry Aima. Please don't get sad. I'll
come whenever you'll call me. I just want you to take
care of all my business. And I don't think Faiq would
have any objection on that. Yeah. Just don't worry.
I will fulfill your wish. Faiq tell it right in front of
everyone what is all this about? Tell them Faiq how much you love me. Tell them that you used to
ignore Aima and came to meet me. Tell them that we used to meet privately
sometimes at your place and sometimes at mine. I know what the reality is and all this
drama has been created by my daughter, I'm well aware of her nature. -Faiq is innocent.
-What are you saying? Quiet, if you say even a single
word more then I'm going to... Look, Nosheen, I've started loving you too. I enjoy your company, if you
aren't with me then I miss you. But I can't do this. I don't have
the courage to elope with you. Dad, please come take a look
at mother, what's wrong with her? Neither she is eating anything nor
she is saying anything, I'm really worried. -Please come and talk to her.
-Aima, please sit down, sit. I know that my sister is
going through a lot of pain because I'm going
through the same agony. Or may be I am in more pain than her. Because I have to take a few
decisions which will hurt a lot of people. I have no objection to
any of your decisions, Dad. Whatever you did was right. I know but there are still some
decisions that I need to take which can effect the lives of many people
but I don't care about anyone. The only thing I care about
right now is my sister's life. What are you talking about? Aima what I'm about to say
to you right now, I don't know what your response and
reaction is going to be on that. But I know one thing for sure that you might understand the
wisdom behind this decision of mine. Right now I'm quite perplexed. And I don't want you to decline
what I am going to ask. What? What is it, Dad? Aima, I as a father want to ask you to marry Zaid. No, this, what are you talking about, Dad? This can't be. My child, this has to
be done at the moment. Dad, me? Zaid? No, this can't happen. -This can't happen.
-Try to understand, dear. I am compelled to do so. No this isn't possible. I'm not the first girl in this world
whose marriage has been called off. This can't happen. What's the worst that can happen?
I will have a stained past, that's it. People are going to say
different things about me. I will tolerate it,
but please I can't do this. So, are you willing to
risk your mother's life? What are you saying? Why would I do that? Then just think of me as helpless, compelled
and I'm asking you to give a sacrifice. Then this time think of me as helpless Whatever you have asked me till
now I did it, I never said no to you. If you had asked for my
life, I would have given it. I wouldn't have denied. But I won't be able to do it. To make my own home I
can't ruin anyone else's home. I can't do this. I know. Aima, I know what you are saying is right. But the question here
is of my sister's life. I beg of you. Don't play with her life.
She will die because of this trauma. You may be able to live in any condition but
she won't be able to bear this pain of yours. And if anything happens to her at least
I won't be able to forgive myself, Aima. I won't be able to forgive myself. Get hold of yourself, Dad. I am unable to face Aima and Shabana, Zaid. I can understand. That girl considers me as her father. And I have become responsible
for her misery in just a moment. Dad, please don't blame yourself, 
you have no fault in all this. How isn't it our fault? It is. My daughter has snatched what
was Aima's, it's all because of her. And we won't be able to
get rid of all this so easily. And I am the one who is suffering 
the most because I have to take decisions. My decisions might hurt a lot of people. But right now I don't care
about anyone. The only thing I care about is my sister's
life, which is most important to me. Zaid. if I ask you something, 
ask something from you, would you say no? Sure, Dad. I hope that you won't say no, Zaid. Dad, tell me without hesitating what I can
do so that we cam get rid of our problems. Zaid, I want you to marry Aima. You wanted to know, then answer me. Yes he is interested in you. Okay, but how can you say that? Because Faiq has told me himself, he
likes you, he wants to know about you. He is really excited
about this relationship. What's wrong Aima? Why
are you so unsure about Faiq? Tell me today, share everything with me. Zaid, I have a feeling that auntie is
forcing Faiq to marry me, he doesn't like me. -But why do you feel that way?
-Because because nobody likes me, Zaid. Zaid, I didn't get married. Aima, Aima look at me. Aima, just look here. I promise I won't
let anything wrong happen with you. Do you listen? Neither Faiq can't do anything,
nor will I let Nosheen do anything. Don't worry, everything
is going to be back to normal. I have told mom what I had to say,
I have given my response. Say it in front of everyone. What are you going to respond. I know that Nosheen's allegations
aren't false but true. And I also know that you didn't go to 
the restaurant that day for a business meeting but you went with Nosheen,
and still I kept quiet. I kept quiet because
I couldn't see Aima in pain. But I don't like Aima but Nosheen. I don't care what you want. They are married, and they left too. Mama, got the dinner served. There weren't many people remaining but those who were there ate. Mama, asked me to tell you guys
that she was tired so she left for home. I feel that uncle and you
should have been there. Everyone was asking about you. I know that Nosheen has done
very wrong but she is your only sister. You could have come when
she was leaving just as a formality. But it's all right, she has left now. Don't worry, Zaid. We are worried too, but what can be done. I'm really sorry, Zoya. For what? Look, Zaid, it's not your fault, okay? Stop blaming yourself. And besides if you are going to lose
hope, who is going to take care of Aima? She depends on us so much. I will have to support Aima, Zoya. That's what I'm saying, that
only you have to support her. I know. That's why I'll have to marry her. -Zaid, where are you going in the middle of the night?
-Dad, Zoya isn't home. She has gone somewhere. Her phone is switched off too, I don't know
where she is. I'm going to look for her. I know that she must have been shocked. I know that she isn't home right now. And it is important for
her to stay away right now. Dad, how can I leave her like that.
It's middle of the night. Why are you getting worried? Where
would she go other than her house? She will take a little
time to accept this fact. Which she is going to do soon. It is the reality, and it's
important for her to accept it. Give her as much time as she wants. I know
that this must be a difficult time for her. At one point it was my wish that
you and Aima would get married. But it has become my compulsion today. Don't you ever think that I
have fulfilled my wish by doing so. I know, Dad. I did what was really
important to do right now. Don't worry about her she
must have gone to Amber. But, Dad, try to understand, half the
night has passed. I can't leave her alone. You try to understand, Zaid. Even if you go to her right now, 
she would never listen to you. Give her some time. Right now you
should be there where you are needed. Please. Cool down, dear. Remember, when I used
to stay up all night missing you then my eyes
used to turn like that too. Stop being so dramatic. Okay, listen, should I tell Aima? What? Zaid, I like you. I like you a lot. -You should be more concerned about Zaid.
-What do you mean? Aima, we both are his best friends. If we
aren't concerned about him who else would be? Now, look, I'm so worried about her. Will I every praise you falsely? Thank you. Zoya, what is this nonsense? What's wrong? I mean, aren't you going to praise me? By looking at you, it
seems as if you are attending a poetic gathering
to recite your poetry. Shakoor. Shakoor bring my breakfast. And after giving me breakfast, 
water the plants. Should I call Zoya? She might be sleeping. 
Let me send her a text. If she is up she will call me. You? At this time? Who did you come with? Where is Zaid? Why don't you say something? What's wrong my child? Zoya? Zoya, tell me, is everything
all right back home? What's wrong? Mom, Zaid and Aima are married. What? Their marriage? When? How? Have you found peace now? Are you content? You have destroyed everything. There is a limit of doing
your own will, Azmat. To take your niece's revenge you have destroyed my son 
and my niece's marriage. How am I going to face my sister? I consider this marriage as invalid. Don't know what you said or threatened to do
to my son that he agreed for this marriage. And a marriage which is forced is invalid. If you don't believe me go ask
anyone, this marriage is not valid. And as far as your niece
is concerned, it was her fate. Faiq rejected her. My Nosheen
has nothing to do with it. Don't you get this simple thing? You stubbornness has destroyed everything. Our happiness, you are the murderer, you are responsible 
for all this destruction. My children, my children. You weren't even able to be there when your only daughter
was departing after getting married. She has left like an orphan. You weren't even able to give you
her blessings while she was leaving. Tell me, how can be a person so rigid? Who, who can be like that? But who am I complaining to? A person who has got no feelings. Who can just see himself, his
will, his pride and his happiness. Why would he care 
about anyone else's sorrow? You used to say it to me, 
today I am going to say it to you, You are an unsuccessful
husband and an unsuccessful father. Remember what I am saying, Azmat. You will be left all alone because of your pride, arrogance
and because of doing your will only. Why are you quiet? Say it, tell
me, answer me, Azmat. Tell me. You have destroyed everything, 
Azmat, everything. You are the murderer of our happiness. You want an answer? This is the answer to your questions. Got it? You want any more answers? All the hearts that are
broken in this house, all the destruction that has happened,
you are the culprit of all that. Only you. All that has happened wrong and
the destruction is because of you. Keep that in your mind. I can't believe, we are married now. Everything seems so nice, Faiq. Till yesterday it seemed as if everything has
ended, and now look, everything is changed. Everything is so nice. And thank you so much that you stood by me. Or else Aima would have been 
sitting here in my place. Why are you sitting
like this with a long face? What's the use of sacrificing so much? We have made all the elder
angry just for our happiness. Please, Nosheen, I'm in a bad
mood right now. Leave me alone. I don't like it at all when you
sit with a long face like this. We are a perfect couple, aren't we? Which always stays happy with each other. How can I be joyful so soon, Nosheen? When I don't feel good at all. -About what?
-This, whatever we have done. We have hurt everyone
just for our happiness. Faiq, you don't need to feel bad at all. Really? And what about Aima? I have told you 
that she is married to brother now. And you know it that she would
always have chosen brother. Nosheen, Zaid already has a wife. Well, Aima must be okay with that,
that's why this marriage took place. Otherwise, think for yourself, when dad didn't force you to marry Aima, how
could he force Aima or brother to get married? So, just relax and don't worry. I can't relax until mom is angry with me. Don't know if she is every going to
talk to me or not, I don't know anything. Faiq, I promise, I'm going to take care of
her so much that she is going to forget Aima. Just don't worry. Anyway, tell me where are
we going for our honeymoon? I don't know, 
I haven't thought about it yet. How rude. Okay, mama must be coming with breakfast. I think no one else would accompany her. Why don't you go and get ready? I'm not in the mood, 
just meet her yourself. Hey! Aima, did you have breakfast? Where is Zaid? I don't know. Look, dear, whatever that has happened consider it as your fate. May be all this was
supposed to happen this way. Did you talk to Zaid? Did he say anything? No. -Did he?
-He didn't come to my room. Mother, Nosheen isn't that type of a girl. You are thinking wrong of her. You don't need to tell me
 what kind of a girl she is. I know her very well. She is a very clever and cunning girl, whom I can never respect. Aima, everyone is blaming me. I haven't committed any sin either, Dad, but I am being judged as well. If you will get angry with me too, 
where am I going to go? You are the only one who understands me. You are standing here with so much
confidence after disgracing yourself. Don't forget that you 
are present in my home. She is your elder. She may be an elder in her house. All her tantrums are because you
have given her so much leverage.
