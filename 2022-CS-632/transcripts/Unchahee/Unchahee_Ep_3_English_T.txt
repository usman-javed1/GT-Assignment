[0.44] From flowers and from buds
[4.56] I have learnt to bloom and be fragrant
[9.18] When I saw you
[18.83] We do not have any brother 
that we can sit at home relying on him.
[25.84] -Yeah, Shabana is lucky in this regard.
-Yes.
[31.39] Now will you hang up? Okay, bye.
[48.42] Here.
[51.68] What's wrong, Zaid? You have made this
long face since you have arrived.
[55.85] -My face is like that.
-I know that very well,
[60.03] but just a second, show me your face.
[63.10] Seems like you have come 
after fighting a battle.
[65.04] You can say that is the case. 
My house is no less than a war-zone.
[70.62]  Why, now what happened?
[75.00] I mean, I don't know, 
since dad has started this second business,
[78.75] the whole environment
 of our house is changed.
[81.02] Restrictions all around the day.
[82.33] Where are you going, 
why are you going,
[83.80] whom are you meeting, 
why are you meeting him?
[85.83] It seems as if we will have 
to even breathe with his permission.
[88.44] Oh, God, really?
[91.52] Yes, man!
[92.64] I mean, can you imagine? He has
taken Nosheen's phone away
[94.63]  and forbidden her to go to college even.
[96.02] Reason? She was talking to some guy.
[98.74] -I mean, so what?
-What?
[100.75] I mean he took her out from college 
on such a petty issue?
[104.79] -I can't believe this.
-I don't either.
[109.08] Thank God, he isn't my dad.
[111.51] Even if he were, what could have you done?
[115.38] Either I would have run away 
from the house,
[117.40] or he would have disowned me by now.
[120.18] Oh come on, easier said than done.
[124.06] The option to walk out is just
in one relation, and that is marriage.
[129.86] Other than that, 
what you got is what you have.
[134.55] By the way,
 why didn't you bring Aima with you?
[138.49] Whose name did you just take.
[141.43] -Why, what did you do with her?
-I am mad at her the most.
[145.08] Oh, so you have fought with her as well?
[147.26] I went to aunt's to pick her up,
[149.29] aunt declined, 
but that girl sewed her lips too.
[152.68] I mean, she didn't insist even once.
[155.13] Zaid, she doesn't say a word as is.
[157.34] And specially she doesn't talk
 in front of elders.
[160.49] We know her that much.
[162.70] Okay, fine, let's talk about
something else. I'm getting angry.
[166.61] I know very well that your anger 
for her is just for a little while.
[170.83] Well, Zaid, may I say something?
[176.80] Please don't mind.
[180.03] -I don't like the environment of your house.
-Even I don't like it.
[185.21] I tell you, these parents...
[187.06] They have done everything in their times,
[189.21] and when it's our turn, 
they tend to be strict.
[193.42] I don't understand 
how you guys cope with it.
[196.50] I can't live in such an environment.
[198.71] Why are you stressing out, 
your mother is so chill.
[203.96] There is one rule at my house,
 live and let live.
[208.06] And because of that, I'm a free bird.
[212.82] I have the whole sky to fly.
[217.52] Really? And what if 
your would-be bounded you?
[222.28] Mm, firstly, I am not going
to marry such a person.
[227.89] And secondly, if any one tires to do so,
[231.32] then I'll break out from my cage, 
and fly away.
[235.87] Well, time will tell.
[237.84] You just started talking like an auntie.
[240.71] -Right, right.
-Have it.
[242.82] Cheer up, and drink it.
[255.49] Hey, Nosheen, come, sit down.
[259.19] No I won't sit,
 I just needed your cell phone.
[262.72] Cell phone? It was right here somewhere.
[268.37] So, now you don't even know 
where you cell phone is?
[271.05] No, actually mother was using it then...
[275.56] I don't know where she kept it.
[277.89] Oh, here it is.
[282.92] Battery is 10% only. 
You could at least keep it charged.
[288.40] Anyway, I'm going to return it in a while,
 just need to make a call.
[292.67] -Listen...
-What?
[296.02] You can call sitting here too.
[300.09] Why? What do you think, I am going
to run away with your cell phone?
[304.64] No, I... I didn't mean that.
[308.69] Don't worry, I'll return it in a while.
[319.07] What if dad sees her using my cell phone?
[325.16] He will lose his trust on me.
[359.13] Every thing all right, sister?
Are you feeling okay?
[364.78] A mother, whose one child has been thrown
 out of the home
[368.06] and other is about to be thrown out,
[371.57] how would she be?
[379.45] It's like troubles have become my fate.
[382.54] Don't worry, sister. 
Everything is going to be fine.
[387.63] Since the day Hammad has been disowned,
[391.36] I haven't slept peacefully
 even for a little while.
[395.30] Of course.
[397.39] I know what a mother goes through.
[402.23] Don't know how he would be living,
 if he has any money or not.
[406.88] Is it such a big crime 
to marry of one's own will?
[412.10] -No, sister.
-Then why did you separate him from me?
[418.56] What?
[422.90] -Me?
-Yes.
[426.98] Your brother promised you 
to get him married with Aima.
[434.37] Yes, sister, he did.
[438.49] And when Hammad didn't marry her,
[441.37] Then you must have cried and wailed a lot.
[444.22] Sister, you are taking me wrong.
[449.52] Hammad, Nosheen...
[454.53] are my own blood.
[459.43] They are my brothers' children.
[462.29] And the one who gave me shelter,
[466.32] loved  my daughter like a father does.
[473.25] Why would I want anything bad for him?
[478.51] Never.
[480.14] Well, only you know best 
what motive you have behind all this.
[488.56] I...
[491.70] I didn't come to this house 
with any sort of motive.
[503.50] My...
[507.16] compulsions brought me to this house.
[516.09] Compulsions...
[519.83] in which a woman...
[523.36] specially a mother...
[527.81] becomes helpless and without any support.
[535.54] I pray to God
[538.62] never to test any woman in such a way.
[544.92] May God keep her husband's
 shelter always on her head.
[549.28] Okay, now go and tell your brother 
all of it with exaggeration,
[553.15] so that we have a fight,
[555.83] and he makes our lives even more hell.
[569.30] Zaid,
[571.53]  you're here, and you didn't even tell me?
[575.62] What happened? How did it go?
[579.24] Hey... I'm talking to you.
[582.59] I don't want to talk to you.
[584.54] Zaid, what is wrong with you? 
What are you angry about?
[587.06] At least tell me that.
[588.99] Oh, how innocent, as if you don't know.
[592.54] Stop being a drama queen, Zaid, 
and tell me clearly what is up?
[598.38] Why didn't you come with me to Zoya's?
[599.91] Oh, God, Zaid. 
You are still stuck with that?
[603.47] You know it well why I didn't go.
[607.52] -Mother told me not to, in front of you.
-She told you not to go just once.
[611.94] Couldn't you insist?
[613.74] When she told me once not to go, 
why would have I asked again?
[617.31] Yes, obviously, a person asks again 
for something if he is willing to do it.
[621.67] But you didn't want to come 
with me yourself.
[623.73] Okay, and why would I want that?
[626.63] I don't know about that. But please, go
away from here for now, don't disturb me.
[631.56] Zaid, you are getting angry 
on such a petty issue for no reason.
[634.54] Oh, really, 
this is such a petty issue for you.
[637.30] Why bother then, end this discussion.
[639.19] You are just looking
 for a reason to be angry with me.
[645.75] I just don't like this habit of yours,
 getting angry on every other thing.
[649.57] You know what? 
I think you don't like me at all.
[655.02] Isn't it so? That's why
you haven't replied. Okay then, fine.
[659.36] Zaid, why are you being so childish?
[662.78] Don't twist the situation, Aima, answer me.
[664.86] Answer you for what?
[667.56] Firstly, why didn't you come with me?
[671.77] And secondly, do you like me or not?
[674.27] And I want the answers right now.
[677.13] Zaid I do not question 
my mother's decisions.
[681.25] When she forbade me once,
 I couldn't go then.
[684.98] Okay, fine, agreed. 
And what about the other question?
[688.51] Do you like me or not?
[697.95] It's just you,
[701.57] that I like.
[704.39] -Really?
-Yes.
[707.29] Why?
[710.33] Because...
[714.22] You are my...
[715.77] very...
[722.17] stubborn, angry and crazy friend.
[726.55] All right, all right, 
take all the advantage you can.
[730.90] You know well that I can't stay angry
 at you for much longer.
[735.11] Forgive me, please.
[738.48] I have told you my decision.
[741.75] You can go now.
[743.08] Why did I become unwanted
[747.61] {\an8}No one knows that
[752.38] Why did I become unwanted
[756.99] {\an8}No one knows that
[762.28] What is your problem?
[764.34] I have been calling you for so long, 
and you weren't picking up.
[768.61] They took my phone away.
[771.28] Stopped me from going to college as well.
[775.31] No, don't do you dare do this stupidity, 
this is my cousin's phone.
[779.26] Whenever I've to call 
I am going to call you myself .
[783.75] Okay, I'll hang up now. And remove
your phone from silent mode.
[790.22] Right now.
[793.58] Aima, don't you
have any manners?
[795.73] That if one is on the phone, you don't
barge in to his room like that.
[800.03] No, I... I just came to get my phone.
[803.63] And that's why you were eavesdropping?
[807.37] Look, I am not interested in eavesdropping,
 I just came to get my...
[810.95] Oh, what had happened if I had
taken your cell phone for a while?
[815.67] Nosheen, my phone is with you 
for the past two hours.
[819.40] Okay, so? Why so restless?
[823.55] Look, if you are done, give me my phone
back, I have to make an important call.
[830.19] Oh, wow, Aima. So much attitude?
[834.15] And it's not like you
are running a business
[836.27] that you have to make
important calls.
[839.82] Why are you arguing with me?
[842.48] Just give me my phone back and I'll leave.
[849.82] Here, and listen...
[853.56] remember one thing,
[855.85] that the clothes you wear, 
the food you eat,
[860.74] and all the stuff you use,
[863.17] those all are provided
by my dad, understood?
[868.87] Oh, and I might need your phone again
[873.22] until I make 
any other arrangement for myself.
[878.25] Go now, why are you still here?
[894.45] Look, someone is here to talk to you.
[903.02] Sorry, Dad. Dad, I'm really ashamed.
[907.01] Forgive me please.
[910.69] I have told you my decision.
[913.96] You can go now.
[915.67] If she is asking for forgiveness, 
why don't you pardon her then?
[918.28] She won't do it again.
[921.06] Dad, if Aima was in my place, 
wouldn't you have forgiven her?
[925.84] Now where did Aima come in all this?
[929.02] Dad, I know, you don't like me
 as much as you like Aima.
[934.60] But, Dad, after all the truth
is that I am your daughter.
[939.27] And no one can love you
as much as I do, Dad.
[944.42] This isn't a contest of love.
[948.93] Children loving their parents, 
taking care of them,
[954.82] one has to do it practically, 
not just say it.
[957.38] She learnt her lesson.
[959.09] Her studies are interrupted as well 
because of skipping college.
[962.89] Please, forgive me, Dad. 
I am asking for forgiveness.
[966.55] Forgiveness...
[969.18] Do you know the meaning of forgiveness?
[972.98] That the mistake is not
going to be repeated.
[976.14] Yes, Dad.
[979.44] Okay, I'm giving you a last chance.
[983.83] Just so that you can prove 
that you have come to your senses.
[987.73] Thank you, Dad. 
Thank you so much, I love you.
[993.10] Okay, I hope that
[996.75] you won't do anything due to which I
have to take any strict measures,
[1001.96] or adopt a behaviour which you regret.
[1005.80] Yes, Dad. Dad, my phone...
[1010.33] Actually I have to discuss 
about assignments with my friends, so...
[1016.57] It's in the drawer in my cupboard.
[1019.04] Give it to her.
[1024.79] Don't you dare do anything stupid now.
[1028.51] I'm not going to save you next time.
[1031.75] We'll see for next time, the next time.
[1040.09] Mother, sometimes I think that...
[1046.03] it would have been 
so nice had father been alive.
[1053.06] Why do you say that?
[1055.27] It isn't that bad even now.
[1058.22] No, I didn't mean that.
[1064.08] -Then?
-I mean to say that
[1068.59] all three of use would have lived together
[1071.67] in our house.
[1074.17] Like a family.
[1078.89] We would have had our own livelihood.
[1082.50] We would have lived as we like.
[1084.27] Aima, has anyone said anything to you?
[1088.47] No, mother.
[1091.17] Look, dear, I have told
you earlier as well.
[1097.87] Don't feel bad 
because of these petty things.
[1103.18] But one gets hurt, mother.
[1107.18] Yes, I know.
[1114.43] But, my child,
I'm here because of my brother.
[1122.13] Because he has never
considered us as a burden.
[1126.12] And never let us feel 
that we have no support.
[1130.59] You are right.
[1133.52] Dad loves more than father.
[1138.83] And the truth is, I don't
remember father, that much.
[1148.29] There are just some fogged memories,
[1152.55] Like, after the evening walk,
[1156.49] having an ice cream on our way back.
[1159.63] Sliding down quickly on
the slide at the park,
[1163.89] and landing straight in father's arms.
[1168.94] Yes, dear,
[1173.82] This is the philosophy of life,
[1180.72] The moment which is right now
[1185.81] here,
[1188.72] just...
[1192.41] just that's good.
[1197.63] Dear, even if God has taken away 
your father from you,
[1205.14] but He has put the love in brother's heart,
[1214.05] the way your father would have loved you.
[1216.58] Yes, mother, you are absolutely right.
[1222.91] Dad has never let me feel 
the absence of father.
[1227.45] He would never let you feel 
your father's absence in future as well.
[1234.12] If God wills.
[1239.44] Aima, come one get up, get up now.
[1243.87] Wash your face.
[1245.14] Come on. And listen,
[1248.71] I don't like my daughter's face like this.
[1251.22] I like her smiling and laughing.
[1256.08] Come one, hurry up.
[1265.07] Brother is refusing all the
proposals that are coming for Aima.
[1273.62] I think that he is thinking
about Zaid for Aima.
[1280.15] But if that happens then...
[1292.63] So, how did your audition go?
[1295.77] Mom, it went well.
[1297.52] You know such weird girls
have come over there.
[1300.72] They had no idea about how
to dress, or how to talk.
[1304.19] My confidence boosted
after looking at them.
[1307.28] Well, that's good then.
[1310.13] Yeah, but, I didn't like the agency.
[1313.87] -Why is that?
-I don't know.
[1316.39] I didn't like the environment.
[1319.86] Okay they forget it.
[1324.12] Let's see. You tell me, 
how is your business going on?
[1329.99] With God's grace, we have
lost some of out clients,
[1334.50] but we are talking to
some new clients as well.
[1336.56] Everything is going 
to be fine if God wills.
[1338.84] Okay, sounds good.
[1341.31] By the way, how is Auntie?
[1345.39] I was listening to her 
problems over the phone.
[1349.88] She just has only one problem, uncle!
[1355.98] He has returned Nosheen's phone
 to her, just yesterday.
[1359.81] Their family has really typical issues.
[1365.70] Too many restrictions 
destroy the environment of a home.
[1373.43] I don't want to, but you dad says
 to keep an eye on you.
[1376.91] Really? And who is going
to keep an eye on you?
[1381.16] Don't you wander all day long yourself? 
What do we know where you go?
[1385.32] Why did I become unwanted
[1389.94] {\an8}Nobody knows that
[1394.62] Why did I become unwanted
[1399.18] {\an8}Nobody knows that
[1404.42] Specially daughters are
effected by it a lot.
[1408.31] Mom, I'm going to take a nap. I have
to go for an other audition tomorrow.
[1411.79] Sit down, I have to talk
 to you about something.
[1415.79] What is it?
[1417.24] Aren't you taking this hobby
of modeling a bit too serious?
[1421.80] Mom, don't you get tired of saying
one thing over and over again?
[1424.18] Because I want you
to get married.
[1426.36] Oh, God, I knew you were going
 to talk about that.
[1429.27] Doesn't my happiness matter to you?
[1431.64] Dear, try to understand
my position as well.
[1436.45] What position?
[1438.32] -I am a single mother.
-So what?
[1442.38] Well, life isn't as easy 
as you think it is.
[1446.94] -What do you want to do, Mom?
-I mean, if I pass away tomorrow,
[1451.25] what are you going to do then?
[1452.88] Mom, please stop it, we can't have 
this emotional drama over and over again.
[1458.91] I just want you to get married
 to a nice guy.
[1462.25] You are getting proposals 
from such nice families, dear.
[1467.13] I am fed up of refusing them.
[1469.21] You want me to get married?
And what should I do then?
[1472.48] Give birth to children 
and take care of the kitchen?
[1476.83] And serve that husband and his mother?
[1480.42] Mom, I can't do all this. 
I can't strangle my dreams like that.
[1487.13] But you know what I think? You are going
to get happy only when I do so, right?
[1491.47] The way you have described it, 
marriage isn't that scary.
[1495.94] There is not much difference either.
[1498.62] You will find out when you are going 
to consider somebody for that.
[1503.02] Might be possible 
that he is your best friend.
[1505.44] Friend? Are you pointing towards Zaid?
[1512.36] It can be.
[1520.17] -Mom...
-It's useless to talk to you.
[1522.36] Mom, you... Okay, okay I'm sorry.
[1525.38] You are thinking
of Zaid and me...
[1528.43] Look, if you are going
to say things like that,
[1530.39] I won't be able
to control my laughter.
[1533.15] Zaid is just my friend.
[1535.60] Okay fine, show me some options,
[1538.67] I will meet them, talk to them, but...
[1541.69] please don't you ever repeat
this thing with Zaid.
[1544.85] Or else I won't be able
 to control my laughter.
[1549.37] Mom, Zaid?
[1563.33] Dad, can I sit with you?
[1566.33] No need to ask, come, sit.
[1571.16] -How are studies?
-Going great.
[1574.20] Expecting my mid term results soon.
[1577.11] -That's great, my God gives you success.
-Amen.
[1582.34] You were complaining the other day
that I don't spend time with you.
[1585.59] So I thought of sitting with you 
and have a chat.
[1589.63] It's good that you came yourself,
 or else I would have come to you.
[1593.89] Did you want me something to do?
[1596.31] Well not that, 
but I wanted a favor from you.
[1600.60] Instead think of it as a request.
[1602.94] What are you saying, Dad? 
Why request, you can order me.
[1608.69] No, no, it's just a request, but...
[1613.02] First tell me, are you
 and Nosheen friends with each other?
[1617.40] I mean how is your
relation with each other?
[1620.70] I didn't get you.
[1622.32] No, I mean, I think you both
don't go along well together.
[1628.48] Yes you are right. We aren't friends.
[1633.47] And what's the reason?
[1635.11] I don't know the reason, 
but I feel that she doesn't like me.
[1640.49] And maybe she doesn't approve 
of me living in this house either.
[1644.83] You both have been raised in the
same house, under the same roof.
[1648.14] You both had the same facilities, but...
[1653.36] The way you both have been brought
up is a lot different, you know why?
[1658.13] The reason is the way your mother 
has taught you her values and etiquettes.
[1661.41] Which my Nosheen doesn't have,
 and that's why I'm really worried.
[1665.39] I'm not home all day long,
[1666.94] But being a father, I keep an eye
on every activity of my children.
[1672.26] Father just order me,
what can I do for you?
[1675.99] I just want that you try 
to be friends with Nosheen,
[1678.78] get a little close to her.
[1680.28] Teach her the etiquettes and ways 
that her mother hasn't taught her.
[1684.14] And if you have a problem with that, 
you can always refuse to do it.
[1688.54] I won't mind it at all.
[1690.69] Dad, I have no issues
 in being friends with Nosheen.
[1694.87] But may be she wouldn't want that, 
because she doesn't like me.
[1700.75] -Did she say anything to you?
-No, Dad.
[1704.09] At times without saying anything,
[1706.78] we can make other's feel 
that we don't like them.
[1712.61] You are right.
[1715.17] That's the reason 
that she is a bit foolish.
[1717.63] And ill-mannered,
and I want that you get close to her.
[1721.27] If you befriend her I am always going 
to be indebted to you.
[1726.77] Dad, don't worry. I'm going to try my best.
[1731.14] Bless you.
[1747.10] Thank God, no one saw me.
[1757.03] Nosheen, where were you since morning,
 and when did you get back?
[1762.49] I have been back since long, Mother.
[1766.40] Tell me the truth, when did you get back?
[1769.94] Why? Were you home 
that you would know when I came back?
[1773.60] And what do you guys get in spying on me?
[1776.36] Where are you coming from? 
And you didn't even go to college today?
[1781.77] I went with a friend.
[1783.63] I just don't get it, what are
these plans that are made daily,
[1786.85]  and you guys don't
even get fed up of them.
[1788.85] -Can't you talk slowly?
-You dad isn't home.
[1793.62] Yes but his informers are.
[1796.20] If they hear a scene will be created.
[1799.74] Nosheen, just tell me 
if you are having an affair with some guy?
[1805.39] Mother, it's very normal of a girl
and boy to be friends these days,
[1809.69] and nobody minds it either.
[1811.37] Stop it, Nosheen. I just know that you dad
doesn't approve of it at all, all right?
[1819.21] Oh, just forget about dad.
[1822.98] He doesn't approve of you much, either.
[1826.89] Just shut up, Nosheen. 
This is your dad's house.
[1831.23] And while living in a jungle,
 one doesn't mess with the lion.
[1834.99] Well it doesn't take much time
 in sidelining an old lion?
[1838.17] You should be ashamed of yourself, what
kind of words do you use for your dad?
[1843.26] You are the one who started it.
[1845.20]  I can't win an argument with you, Nosheen.
[1848.17] Oh, Mother, if your interrogation is
over, please go and let me take rest.
[1853.45] I am not interested either, it's your
dad who asks me to keep an eye on you.
[1856.85] Really? And who will keep an eye on you?
[1861.15] Don't you wander all day long?
What do we know where you go?
[1866.05] What if the college has called
your dad on you being absent?
[1870.09] I'm not that stupid, Mother.
[1872.95] I have given them my number
 instead of dad's.
[1875.86] And if they would have called, 
I would have asked some guy to attend it.
[1879.33] Do you have any idea what you are doing?
[1881.74] Please don't lecture me. I am doing 
the same that you did before you came.
[1885.37] Just roam around, enjoy.
[1887.15] You are such a sham less girl, do
you have the least bit of manners,
[1890.30] what are you accusing your mother of?
[1892.13] See? It felt bad, right?
[1894.16] Now just imagine, when you all accuse me,
doubt me, how bad I feel?
[1899.68] Go to hell. Carry on your
the silly things you do.
[1903.56] The day your dad catches you, he is
going to marry you off right away.
[1906.90] Don't come crying to me then.
[1935.15] Zaid...
[1939.82] Zaid I want a suggestion from you.
[1943.07] Hmm?
[1944.77] Dad has given me a very difficult task.
[1948.95] Hmm.
[1952.97] He wants me to befriend Nosheen.
[1957.41] All right.
[1960.16] What's right?
[1961.56] I'm asking you how to approach Nosheen.
[1967.42] Are you even listening, Zaid?
[1970.08] Fine, if you are busy, I'll leave then.
[1973.45] No, carry on, I was listening to you.
[1978.61] Okay, then tell me what was I saying?
[1982.80] Yeah, you are saying that...
[1987.29] you want to be friends with Nosheen. Nice.
[1991.51] Why do I want to be friends with Nosheen?
[1995.97] No, no, actually dad has asked you
[1999.42] that you stay with Nosheen, 
when she is alone.
[2003.88] So, it's okay.
[2008.26] No, I actually heard it,
 don't know where I'm wrong.
[2011.05] What's so important that's
going on over the phone, huh?
[2012.76] -Let me see.
-Aima, give me my phone back.
[2013.92] -Or else?
-This isn't a joke, give me my phone back.
[2017.64] There is a limit, man. There is
something called privacy. Such a nerve...
[2023.10] What's so important in that phone?
[2025.48] You have no regard of anybody's privacy.
[2028.02] It can be something important.
[2032.02] What the hell...
[2035.37] Okay, sorry. Hey, listen.
[2049.07] Why did I become unwanted
[2053.08] {\an8}Nobody knows that
[2058.41] Why did I become unwanted
[2062.41] {\an8}Nobody knows that
[2067.64] Brother, what if Aima
 has committed suicide?
[2072.58] Just shut up, Nosheen. 
Say something nice for once.
[2076.71] Just don't worry, sister.
 I'll go and ask her.
[2080.68] Why would I worry?
[2082.86] And if she does something silly, 
hen I'm telling you
[2086.09] we shouldn't be blamed.
[2088.87] -Aima!
-What is this madness?
[2090.71] -Why are you taking the trouble on you?
-Auntie I think we will have to break the door.
[2093.87] Are you mad? You will be trapped, 
the police is going to arrest you.
[2096.93] What the hell are you talking about.
[2098.16] If something happens to Aima,
 I won't spare anyone.
[2100.05] -God knows, what this...
-Aima!
