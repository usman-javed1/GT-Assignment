From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned to chirp from you Who are you? This is my husband's number. What? How? How is he doing now? Nosheen, who was it on the phone? -Aren't you angry with me, Aima?
-Why would I be angry with you, Nosheen? You know, I have always
deliberately given trouble to you. I have always teased you deliberately. I have decided to divorce Aima. Why are you leaving her, Zaid? Just because I don't like her? Or because I am going to
be the mother of your child? If that's the case then I have lied to you. I'm not expecting. Zoya, when did you come? Just a while ago. Please, come, sit with me. No, I haven't come to sit down. I'm just here to end the game. -Which game?
-The game which I was playing. The game which was
going on between us three. Don't worry, I won't
tell anything to Zaid. I know it. You can't even tell. Because you aren't like me, Aima. I could have gone to
any extent to have Zaid. And you might not hate me so much as much I had started hating you. Zoya, don't worry
everything is going to be all right. Zaid will start loving
you like he used to. Yeah, I know. I have come here to
make everything all right. I have told Zaid the whole truth. He will never be able to love me again. I have lost him, Aima. Are you going to stay friends with me? I know that it is something absurd but there is no other solution
available other than this. Yes, brother, if the
kids have no objection why would I object then? -You have made a very wise decision.
-Yes. -Didn't you like it?
-No, brother. I feel that Aima may stay happy. Because the way Hammad has talked to me,
I feel that he is going to keep Aima happy. I feel the same too. Where is Almas? She has gone to the
orphanage to feed the children. Oh, okay. -Brother, I'm really happy today.
-Really? Why is that? No matter what attitude
sister has kept with me, but now she has cleared my
heart from her side by apologizing. It's good, she realized it late
but at least she did. Yes, brother. realizing the fact that we are at
fault, not every one can do that. Otherwise, everyone here is
after finding other people's faults. Yes, that's true. Oh, sister Nimra, please come, sit. I have to talk to you about
something very important. If it is about leaving this house then
I am not going to listen to it at all. Yes, he is absolutely right. You are
not going to go anywhere from here. This is all your love and care. But, Shabana, I'll have to go
one day. It's been so many days. This is like your own home too,
isn't it? What's the problem then? I don't think its appropriate
to send you there. You are absolutely right. But don't worry, I am not
staying here, in fact I am going to go to Canada
to live with Asim in a few months. Okay. Yes, and I wanted to
talk to you in this regard. Sure, please go ahead. Actually, if you don't have any objection
I want to take Nosheen with me too. See, that's fine but... Oh, I understand your concern very well. But Nosheen is my
responsibility more than you. And I have talked to
Asim in this regard as well. I didn't get you. Actually, Asim wants to
own Nosheen with her child. Oh, that's great news. Your house will get together
once again, that will be great. Yeah, Shabana, my heart used to sink
when I watched Nosheen. The sorrow of being a
widow at such a young age. And then, where will she
go with such a small child? But to tell you the truth, what Asim has
said today has taken the burden off of me. But tell me, have you put
any pressure on Asim to do it? No, not at all. This thing
didn't even cross my mind. He has said it himself to me that I
am going to own my brother's child. When God gives us sorrow then He also
grants us the courage to bear it as well. And He heals the sorrow too. No doubt, that's how it is. My body burns by the sorrow
That I have draped myself with I have learned to burn
when I saw the fire burning. Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that Even you don't know it And I don't know it either. When I think of being apart from you
I get afraid. I have learned to walk after
you have held my hands. Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that Even you don't know it Just my God knows it -It's okay.
-No. It's not okay. You were right, I shouldn't have lied. But. Mom, everything is fine now. Besides, I have told Zaid the whole truth. And honestly it feel so light. Seems as if I have
taken a burden off of me. I went to sister's home. -When?
-I just got back from there. Then? I have said sorry to sister,
brother Azmat and Zaid too, and I told them that
you have got no fault in it, everything has
happened because of me. You didn't need to do that. It was needed. Everyone
shall know the truth. -But what difference does it make now?
-What if it does make a difference? Mom, I have had a lot
of expectations in life. May be that's why I have
always been disappointed. But now, I have thought that
I am going to expect nothing, and will leave everything
to God, like Aima does. I will pray for you. Thank you, Mom. That's
the best gift I can get. Mom! Please don't cry. Mom, if you are going to do
that, what am I going to do then? -I love you.
-I love you too dear. Yes, Zaid, that's the truth. Aima, why didn't you
tell this to me earlier? I have hidden it not just
from you but from myself too. I didn't want anybody to
know that I am in love with you. But even after knowing that
it could have been possible, you told me to marry Zoya? But why? Because I am unwanted to you. Zaid. I am in love with you
but you don't love me. -But, Aima.
-You love Zoya only. and that's the truth. The rest are just compromises. Everyone wants to be
together with the one they love but nobody would want to
stay unwanted in someone's life. If I have any sorrow in
my heart, it's just that, that I am unwanted for you. And I don't want to live like that. I'm sorry, Aima. I have hurt you so much, unknowingly. It's okay Zaid. Excuse me, I hope I am not intruding. No, please come. Aima, if you don't mind, can you
get me a glass of water, please? I'll get it. Zaid, what have you decided? You must be thinking why am I after you? No, it's not like that. Zaid, actually I wanted
to say something to you. Sure, go ahead. I'm sure you are worried that what is going to happen
to Aima if you will divorce her? Yes, that's what I'm worried about. If Aima has no fault why
shall she be punished? You know it well, nobody owns a divorced
girl in this society. Zaid, if I assure you that Aima won't stay alone, then? Will it be easier for
you to take a decision? You got it right. Zaid, I... want to own Aima. I mean, if she has no objection. Thank you so much! Nosheen. my dear. Oh, God! You are the most
merciful and benevolent. Please reduce our sorrows, oh, God. What's wrong, Mama?
Why are you crying like this? See, even me and auntie
have stopped crying now. These tears are pouring out
themselves, they are God's blessing that he keeps pouring on us. He keeps blessing me even after my sins. Mama, why are you
saying all this? I don't get it. I am so fortunate that
God hasn't punished me. What has happened, Mama? Nimra has asked your
hand in marriage for Asim. What is wrong with you guys? It is my life, and you didn't even
find it necessary to even ask me? Yes, Asim has said it himself to Nimra. Asim is my brother in law. Don't you guys even have
any regard for relationships? The reason because of which that
relationship existed, he isn't there anymore. That too much, Mama. Nobody even forgets
the death of some stranger so soon, as soon you have forgotten
my husband's death. No, it's not like that. Faiq
will always be in or hearts. No ifs and but. I'm telling you
nothing of this sort will happen. Nosheen, you have your whole
life ahead, and then a child too. How are you going to manage yourself and the kid, all by yourself? That is going to be my child, I don't
need anybody to take care of him. And if I am a burden
on you then let me know. I am not going to stay here as is. I am going to live with my mother
in law at my husband's house. Even you mother in law
is not going to stay here, Asim has called her to Canada as well. Iâ€™ll stay alone then,
I have told you I don't need anyone. Nosheen you are just being
emotional and sentimental right now. But you guys don't have
any regard of my emotions. It's hurting me, Mama. Why can't you guys understand? Don't cry like this, Nosheen,
I have never seen you crying like this. Today when my own daughter is crying my
heart is breaking and getting distressed. I am getting it now that the mothers whose
daughter I have hurt to date how would have been they feeling. Don't cry. I told you Mama, you get
re-compensated of your deeds in this world. What goes around comes around. I have understood it now, Nosheen, that's why I have asked for forgiveness
from your auntie, Aima and Amber. I have hurt all of them. You did very right, one feels less
burdened by asking for forgiveness. One feels relieved. Nosheen, I know you must
have complaints from me. I haven't raised you
like I was supposed to. Your father is right, I am
an unsuccessful mother. No, Mama, it's not like that. What is done I can't change it. But I will try that this
doesn't happen again. Maybe God is giving me a chance to repent. Yes, Mama, God always keeps the door
open for repentance for His people. Will you agree to something I ask? Mama, please don't ask me
something that I can't agree to. Okay, but at least listen to me. Nosheen, you have always done what you
wanted and I have always supported you. Today, for once, for all of us elders'
sake, please say yes to Asim's proposal. All of us including your Dad, Nimra, both your brothers, we are so
happy about knowing this proposal. But, Mama, I can't do this. Nosheen, not only for you but this
proposal is good for you unborn child too. The way Asim is going to
raise your child and love him, no other person in
the world can do it. One more thing,
nobody is going to force you. If you still decide against it,
nobody is going to force you. I will still wait for your response. Think over it , take your time. And Nosheen, am I standing by
you even today, I will support you. Oh, God! I have never
asked you anything like this. I don't even know how to
ask for something properly. I am unable to take any decision. I am getting so restless. It isn't easy to take some decisions. Oh God, why don't you help me? Please help me make a decision. The decision which is
right for me and my child. Yes, Amber, just pray that
Aima and Hammad's wedding brings happiness to us all. Honestly, I am really
happy with this decision and I have sincerely accepted
Aima as my daughter in law. Please Amber, pray for my Nosheen
that God returns her happiness. Okay Amber, I'll call
you in a while, okay? Bye. -Have you eaten?
-Yes. I didn't feel like eating but I still did,
because I can't just think about myself. The one who is breathing inside
me I have to think about him too. You're right, it's not easy to be a
mother, and every mother tries that... Nosheen, are you thinking about something? Just that what one thinks
and what happens instead. Nosheen, this is what
is called God's will. Nimra came to me a while ago and
was asking what Nosheen has decided. Auntie came to me too. -Really? What did she say?
-The same what you said. Zaid and Hammad were
saying the same to me. -Did you dad talk to you too?
-Yeah, he came to me too. He is very worried about you. We all
can't see you sad like this, Nosheen. Mama, I know that you all love me a lot. If you do then tell me,
what have you decided? What should I tell Nimra? You all wanted me to say yes, right? -No, we just...
-I accept this proposal. Nosheen, I hope you aren't taking
this decision because we all want it. -No, Mama.
-Then? I prayed to God that whatever
decision is right for me and my child He shall put it in my heart. And then I thought that I have
never listened to my elders before. I thought that I should say yes. And after thinking over it
and making this decision I have a feeling that I have
made the right decision. Are you serious? Yes. Does this mean that you
are happy with this decision? What are you thinking? Life is... Zaid, you? Yeah, me, but what is there
to be so surprised about? No, actually, I wasn't expecting you. Okay. So, I'll leave then. No, I didn't meant to say that. Okay, I'll stay then. Zoya, come with me,
I have come to take you. -But...
-No ifs and buts, not questions. Come with me. And I won't let you go anywhere this time. Does this mean that you have forgiven me? To err is human. But if God forgives why
can't humans forgive? Zoya I had made a lot of promises
to you which I couldn't fulfill. That's why I am making
no promise this time. But I will try my best that
you don't get hurt all your life. And we stay happily like this. I will also try, Zaid, that Aima
has no complains from me. Now come, we're getting late,
we have to make preparations too. But where? What preparations? Nosheen is going to Canada. Yes, Faiq's brother lives there so he
has called both auntie and Nosheen there. -Oh!
-Auntie will get Asim and Nosheen married there. Oh, that's a good news. And... And then, here... Hammad and... Hammad and Aima will get married as well. What?
