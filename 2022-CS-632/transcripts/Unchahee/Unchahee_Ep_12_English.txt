From flowers and from buds I have learnt to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you What news did he get through messages
due to which he got so worried? You know, he doesn't talk
to anyone when he is worried. He sent Mama and Nosheen
out of his room too. He has asked me that... whatever proposals Aima has got, consider
them and whichever seems suitable, get Aima married as soon as possible. Do you remember, Dad? When you left your phone,
I brought it back to you. I have seen everything, Dad.
And I know why you are worried. Where are you, Zaid? Why is he disconnecting my call? Yes, Zaid, where are you both? Everyone has submitted their files. -He has seen the message but not replied?
-Hello. So weird of them. Listen, I've messaged you,
you have seen it but haven't replied. Aima isn't picking my call either.
Where are you guys. You guys just go to hell.
I am going to submit my file. You will go to the university alone
from now on, Aima won't go with you. Dad, you wanted me
to take interest in domestic issues. And now when I'm asking you about what is happening at home
then you aren't telling me. Look, son, I want you
to take interest in domestic issues, But I don't want you to ask me questions. There was a reason that I didn't tell you. Whatever the reason is, Aima, there is just one justification for it
and that is that you don't trust me. I have no importance in your life. It's nothing like that, Zaid.
Please try to understand. Such a huge thing happened and even
Zoya didn't let me know about it? I kept asking you both
over and over again to please tell me what is
the problem, share with me, And every time you guys avoided answering
it by talking about something else, as if I were a kid. As if you were
avoiding something a kid is asking. Zaid, please pick up the phone. Why aren't you picking up? Oh, God, what is happening to me. Everyone is angry with me. I don't understand anything. At least you should pick up the phone. Aima. Yes, Mother? Aima, is everything all right?
You didn't go to university today. And you said it's important
for you to go today. I'll handle it, Mother. Aima, were you crying? No, I wasn't. Did anybody say something to you?
Sister or Nosheen? Mother, no one has said anything to me. I'm okay. I am just a little unwell. You are unwell?
Did you eat something? -Yes, I... I had my breakfast.
-Rally? Okay, listen if you aren't feeling well
let's go to the doctor to get you checked, I'll call brother... Mother, just stay with me.
Sit here with me. I will start feeling well myself. Aima, Aima dear, why do I feel like you are
hiding something from me? No, Mother, it's nothing like that.
Just... just pray for me. Greetings, auntie. You
came after so long. Everything all right? Yes. I didn't want to come
even today, but what can I do? Sister has been calling me since many days and I don't refuse what
elders ask me to do. That's good, you should keep visiting. After all you can say
your heart out to mama only. See, your friend is here. Mama was thinking that you won't
come here ever again for no reason. Did you greet your aunt? Oh, Mama, why wouldn't I?
She is my real aunt. And no matter how the real relatives are,
we should give them the utmost importance. Nosheen answer me
as much as I have asked you. Go and get some tea and supper ready
for you aunt Amber. Go now, go. All right. By the way, sister, I was expecting
a little improvement in her behaviour. Why? Didn't Nosheen greet you? I am not talking
about her greeting me or not. At least she should have apologized
to me on her previous behaviour. Amber, she is very sorry but I think she must be feeling
shy apologizing in front of you. Anyway, I think she is never ashamed. Okay forget it, tell me
have you come alone? No, Zoya is with me. Really? I didn't see her. You know well why she comes
to your home. She said she is going to meet Zaid
and Aima and then come here. Yes of course,
they both are her only relatives. Anyway, whatever she feels
is right for her. Sister, you were trying
to tell me something over the phone. Yes, I forgot to give you
the breaking news. Aima has been caught red-handed. -Doing what?
-She went to meet a guy at his home. How did you know? Don't know that guy is of what calibre.
He sent obscene pictures to Azmat too. He is blackmailing too. What does that guy want? What would he want? Either Aima or money.  You know, Azmat doesn't tell anything. My God! These mother daughter pose how
pious they are in front of the world and look what they do secretly. Oh, yes, they have fooled everyone. By they way, sister,
one thing is clear after this incident. -What's that.
-That this girl isn't after Zaid. Really, I never thought about this thing. Besides, Zaid is interested
in a girl named Kinza. I have seen them talking. Really? That's good news. Actually, Amber, I was thinking
of something since many days. Then say it sister. If you aren't going to
tell me then will you tell it to Shabana? I wish Zoya and Zaid would like each other and we could get them both married. Sister, it would be so fortunate for me if my daughter becomes
your daughter-in-law.  -But...
-But, what? Sister, I will have to talk to Zoya. I don't want to do anything
without her consent. Well then why don't you ask Zoya
and I ask Zaid if he likes her. Yes, you talk to Zoya
and I'll talk to Zaid. Actually I mentioned it once
in front of her. But she didn't show much interest. And I can't get her married
without her consent... You get my point?
I don't want to force her. Where ever she wants, and with who
ever she wants to get married, be it Zaid or anyone else, I am
going to get her married there. Zaid, I am not Aima,
so behave yourself, okay? Then don't listen, go from here. I am a savage person,
I start beating up people walking by. It's not like that, Zaid. Why did I get unwanted Nobody knows that Why did I get unwanted Nobody knows that What is this childish behaviour? Zaid, I'm talking to you, answer me. I have got no answer. What's your problem? I don't have any answer
to the questions from both of you. Do you even know what you are saying? Do you have any idea
what you both have done? What was this childish behaviour?
Whatever it is, bear it yourself. Zaid, she wanted to share it
with you, but... You guys have no reason, just excuses. We have a reason. If you had
talked to Aima peacefully, she would have told you
the reason as well. And you know why Aima didn't tell you this? Because she was afraid you might do
something stupid when you are alone. -And what did you think?
-You won't believe me, but I wanted to get you involved in this. And what benefit did you guys get with
hiding it from me? Is the matter solved? Where did this cool
and composed nature took her? Rather she is in trouble. How is
she going to go to university now? That's what I'm saying Zaid
that you should support her, so that uncle believes her. You know what, Zoya, I just don't care. So, are you going
to leave her just like that? Yeah, do whatever you both like. Zaid, I am not Aima,
so behave yourself, okay? Then don't listen, go from here. I am a savage person,
I start beating up people walking by. It's not like that, Zaid. I just don't know how
to solve such matters, so why are you discussing it
with me? Please leave. -Zaid, will you stop being so stubborn?
-No. You both have hurt me,
that too just to save a cheap guy. If I got to lay my hands on him I would
have buried him ten feet under the ground. I think Aima has done right,
not to tell you. because honestly you have no idea
what you say and do when you are angry. Zaid, I just came to say that,
what's done is done. Now, just talk to her and support her. Because she needs you right now. You took so long to get back today. Yes, I had too much to do at office today. Would you like to tell me something? What is it? -Azmat, I am complaining to you.
-What for? Such a huge incident happened in the house
and you didn't even mention it to me? Almas, if you are
not concerned with something I don't think it is important for me
to mention it in front of you. Yes, of course, it would have
been only concerned with me  if it was mine or Nosheen's fault. Right? Or if you were criticizing us. -It's not like that.
-It is like that, Azmat. You couldn't have criticized me over it. that's why you didn't
even bother telling me. I would definitely like to talk
to you, but not on this topic. And I would like to talk
on this very topic only. -Ain't I a part of this house?
-You are a part of this house, but... If I am a part
then where does this "but" come from? Tell me, I want to know
how Shabana feels after knowing all this? I haven't told Shabana about it yet. Great, Azmat, just great. You have done injustice. Why will I be held accountable?
And what injustice have I done to you? You are a Hitler when being a husband,
and Mr. generous when being a brother. There is a thing called moderation, Azmat. Let alone taunting her,
you haven't even told Shabana yet. I don't get one thing, Why do you wish bad for Shabana? Why would I wish bad for her? Her
daughter is enough to do bad for her. What do you want then? I just want to prove, Azmat, that your principles for your sister
are something else than for us. Where did the equality go which you
keep  properating, round the clock? If this is what you think
then you are mistaken. My principles are similar for everyone. I am going to tell Shabana,
but at the right time. And when will
those beautiful moments arrive? My sister is a heart patient. I don't want her to tell anything right now
which can be fatal for her. I think you know it very well,
you aren't that stupid, what I am trying to say. Do you get it? Yes, sure, Azmat.
I am the dumbest in this house. -Anyway...
-That is enough for me. You know it well. And I
know it well too that you guys are taking
advantage of my weak point. But I won't get irritated
no matter how much you try. If you can get me a cup
of tea then bring it, or else just switch
 the light off and leave. Zoya said you wanted to talk to me? You know very well
what I want to talk to you about. No, not at all. Why would I know? My thinking is very different now from that
of you two. So, I don't have any idea. You can at least
look towards me while talking. Go ahead. Zaid, please don't do this to me. I shouldn't do? What can I do, Aima,
you have done it all to yourself. Please, forgive me. Remember you said
that silence is partial agreement. Yes, but this time it doesn't mean that. Please, I don't feel like talking to you. Zaid, you don't like me anymore
because of such a petty issue? Petty issue? This might be a petty issue
for you, but not for me. You know what, Aima, don't hurt me any
more by talking like this, just leave. Fine, I'll leave. But remember one thing, Today, when I need you
the most, are aren't with me. No one is going to believe me. And you know my character well,
don't you, Zaid? Yes I was aware of your character, but here I can't support you because
I am not aware of anything. You called him yourself.
You went to meet him at his flat as well. For all I know, you might be having
an affair with him too. Listen, I'm sorry, I got carried away.
I didn't mean to... Okay, sorry, please. Sit down, sit. I didn't mean to say that. Why do you do it? I know it's my fault. My character has become 
questionable because of my mistake. Are you insane?
Nothing of this sort is going to happen. You know even if an angel 
testifies against your character, then I won't believe him. Listen, don't worry. I'm here for you.
Everything is going to be fine. Just give me his number 
I will get all the information. Thank you. Thank you so
much for trusting me. Or else, I couldn't have
trusted myself either. Stop talking like a fool, and listen, stop this habit 
of crying over every petty issue. Keep smiling. Aima has gotten into wrong things. And that guy, he is blackmailing now. Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that -Dear...
-Wow, what a surprise?! What is it? Did I disturb you? No one can disturb me so easily. By the way, why have you come? I can't find brother, where has he gone? Dad is in a lot of stress, but he has
gone out for some work right now. But don't you worry, he will get your medicines. Did you want to talk 
to him about something? Yes, I wanted to talk to him. But is everything all right? 
Why is brother in stress? -Don't you know?
-No. If dad hasn't told you then there
must be some reason behind it. Look, I am really worried after
knowing that brother is in stress. Tell me what is it? Why is he in stress? Okay, but don't tell dad 
that I have told this to you. I remembered something 
after looking at you. -Won't you ask me what it is?
-What is it? Only the flower's unaware
Rest of the garden knows Be strong while listening to it. Aima has been caught red-handed
in a guy's house. -What?
-Yes. Everybody has the got photos too. And that guy, he has been threatening dad. Aima? My? My Aima? Yes, Aima. Your Aima. Anyway, that rascal has even said that
he is going to put Aima's pictures  on a shady website. Only God can save Aima now. What is going to happen to her now, auntie. Aima has gotten into such bad things. And that guy, he is blackmailing now. Poor dad, it's so sad, he was so proud of Aima... Auntie... auntie! Auntie? Go ask the driver 
to get the card ready, hurry up! Auntie, auntie... auntie! Hurry up, driver.
Get the car ready! Auntie! -Dad, have some water at least.
-No, I don't want water. You guys are here since long. 
Aima, at least you have some water. I don't want to drink water, Zaid. Mother is inside since so long,
doctors haven't told anything yet. Look, Aima, it's a heart related issue.
It's going to take time examining it. Please don't worry, hope the best from
God, everything is going to be fine. I a really worried, Zaid. I can understand, but please pray for her I am also praying.
Everything is going to be okay. Dad, you have been standing 
for so long, please sit down. I'm fine, you sit down. Dad, please sit down for a while. Zaid... I can't stand seeing him angry with me. Be strong, Aima. Once auntie gets back home after getting
well, everything is going to be fine. Don't worry, I'm here. You... have some water, have it. 
No, just have it. Nosheen, where did you get 
your mobile from? -I knew it since long where it was hidden.
-And where was it? In Dad's drawer. I just couldn't get a chance 
to get it out from there. When I got a chance, I got it. And what if he finds out? And who is going to tell you? You? No, I am not going to tell him. How would he know then? -All he has on mind now is auntie's health.
-That's true. Haven't heard of him for quite some time. Why?  Didn't you talk him over the phone? I did but he didn't tell me 
anything as such. Well, had it been something big, 
we would have know it by now. This means it's nothing serious. I think, there is 
Shabana's conspiracy behind it. She has planned it all thoughtfully. You mean, was she pretending 
to have a heart attack? It seems like a new deceit
created by Shabana. So that she can gain
Azmat's sympathies again, and Aima's topic is closed forever. Yes, Mama, you are right. Now, look, what sort of
pain is it that comes when one wants to,
and goes when one wants. Aunties was perfectly fine till the evening, 
and suddenly she got heart pain? I told you. They both are very cunning. They will not give up so easily. Anyway, don't get worried, 
the ball is still in our court. It's too late now, just go and sleep. Nosheen, you too. Okay? Zaid, please go and find out. 
Doctor's haven't told us anything yet. Aima, I just went and asked. They are saying they have
to do some urgent tests, and they are going to tell
the situation after that. It's all because of me. I have made a lot of blunders. I hurt you by not telling you. I troubled mother, lost dad's trust. Mother is worried because of me. It's not your fault, Aima. 
Why are you saying that? It is like that, Zaid. Mother wasn't aware of what is going on,
but she was still worried. Did she say something to you? She didn't say anything in front of me, but internally she was worried about me. She must have taken stress about it. Zaid, if something happens to her because
of me, I could never forgive myself. Please, don't talk like that. Look, dad's here. -Did the doctor tell anything?
-Not yet, Dad. I asked them. They are doing some tests 
and given her few injections. -Zoya?
-Mom, Auntie Shabana has got a heart attack, Zaid just called me, he was saying 
Aima's condition is well at all. I'm going to the hospital. Okay, so where are you going at this hour? Mom, she is my friend's mother. Look, her condition isn't that serious
right now that you must go to the hospital. How do you know? -Your aunt told me.
-And you didn't bother to tell it to me? I didn't tell you intentionally, that you might get disturbed
and stay worried all night. So am I not getting disturbed now? Okay, just don't get angry, come here. 
Come, sit down. Mom, you should come 
to the hospital with me. What are we going to do there? What are you talking about? 
Why do people visit the hospital? She is in the emergency room right now. You know it well that they don't let
many people stay in the emergency room. Brother Azmat, Zaid and Aima,
everyone is already there. And you know how your uncles is. If he says anything to you,
I won't like it at all. But, Mom, I think she would need me. Fine, call her right now, 
and you can go later. Okay, fine. Why did I get unwanted Nobody knows that Why did I get unwanted Nobody knows that. -What is wrong with mother?
-She has had a major heart attack. We will have to do her angiography, so that
we can know how many arteries are blocked. Major heart attack? -He likes a girl called Kinza.
-Really? My would-be sister-in-law's name is Kinza? Doctor has told Shabana not to talk much. May that's why Aima said this to you. I didn't go to chat either,
it was all the usual. What happened, when it happened
and how it happened, that's it. Kids want to do everything 
according to their own wish. They want to make the decisions about
their own lives with full right as well. It is like that, Dad.
