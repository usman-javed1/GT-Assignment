[0.00] From flowers and from buds
[4.57] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.16] When I saw you
[18.76] Have you asked your sister in law
what she wants for dowry?
[24.05] Sister, I don't find it
appropriate asking her this.
[31.55] Look, I'm just saying that in your favor.
[33.93] This way you'll know if they want any dowry
or not. And if they do what do they want?
[40.90] Why did you take Nosheen along? This
was supposed to be your special moment.
[46.16] And you involved Nosheen in it?
[49.51] You're so stupid.
[51.39] I'm busy right now.
[53.93] -What do you think?
-What the hell?
[55.16] That if we don't remind you that
doesn't mean that we all have forgotten.
[58.94] Are you going to do whatever you want?
[61.45] Have you forgotten what you have done?
[63.52] Who the hell are you to forgive me?
[65.65] So, you handle your dad's business?
[68.23] Yeah, actually I've joined recently.
[70.89] Not only me, Aima has
joined with me as well.
[74.34] -I think uncle has a garments business.
-Yes, garments.
[78.58] Import and export to be precise.
[80.83] We export consignments from here,
[82.84] dad's partner in the US
receives it and deals further.
[86.16] -Good.
-You tell me, how is your business going?
[90.07] Yeah, going good, but it's moving slow.
[93.75] But if I say that it's going in the
right direction it won't be wrong.
[98.63] You know what? I saw your plan,
and I'm telling you it will work.
[103.14] Thank you.
[105.44] By the way, I've hears that you're
really good friends with Aima.
[111.26] Actually, me Aima and Zoya
are friends since childhood.
[114.62] School, college, university,
we were together in all of them.
[117.47] And see, now we're
all getting married together as well.
[119.86] Impressive, that's
what's called friendship.
[123.18] To tell you the truth, aunties says that
we heard about two bodies and one soul,
[127.77] but I am hearing three bodies
and one soul for the first time.
[130.78] By the way, there is another rumor about
you that you are marrying your cousin.
[136.18] I have to agree, you informant
has filled you in with correct information.
[140.48] You guys have met just once
and Aima has told you everything?
[143.27] Do you guys even talk about yourselves or
am I always the hot topic between you two.
[147.48] Oh, my would be wife is really
a miser when it comes to talking.
[152.03] That's why we have talked
about you only with her.
[153.94] That's all right, but you guys should
know each other before getting married.
[157.79] Yes, you're right. One should know
each other before getting married.
[161.91] But we don't talk that much.
[164.19] If she isn't talking,
why don't you initiate?
[167.09] I'm telling you she's a great listener.
[169.40] You should develop some
understanding with her, I'm telling you.
[173.08] I don't think there is going to be
an issue with the understanding.
[175.95] Because Aima is my cousin.
[178.28] That's what you think.
Zoya is my cousin too.
[181.59] But childhood friendship
and things on one side,
[184.54] the friendship, and meetings
post engagement on the other side.
[188.38] -Really?
-Oh, yes.
[190.72] Actually after being in a relationship
[194.98] the girl and the boy change a bit.
[198.19] Which is beautiful, I'm telling you.
[200.38] You get a feeling that you
have someone in your life
[204.47] who likes you who misses you
[207.53] in their little joys and sorrows, and
at times miss you without any reason.
[213.33] That's why I'm telling you, you should
get to know the other side of Aima.
[217.34] Wow, I'm impressed.
You talk quite sensibly.
[221.56] Aima has made a great friend.
[223.50] To tell you the truth, Faiq, I'm grateful
[226.90] that Aima is friends with me.
[229.75] Whatever qualities I have
are because of Aima.
[233.93] By the way, Zaid, may I ask something?
[237.87] Look, I'm asking you this because you
know Aima very well, you're close to her.
[243.79] Can she become a good life partner?
[248.81] Look, Faiq, there is a lot that I can say
[252.58] but I'll say one thing only,
[255.22] -You're a very lucky man.
-Really?
[258.51] Aima is the best girl, in every aspect.
[261.74] She is the best daughter, best friend,
[265.61] actually it won't be wrong if I say
that she is the best human being.
[270.43] And I have no doubts that she is
going to prove herself as the best wife.
[274.56] Mom tells me that too,
that she is perfect for me.
[278.37] Well, then Mr. Faiq I expect that
you'll become Mr. perfect as well
[281.80] and give this relationship its full rights.
[284.05] Let's see, I'll try my best.
[287.52] -Come, let's go inside.
-Yeah, let's go.
[295.09] What kind of things
were you saying at their place?
[297.69] What do you mean? What kind of things?
[299.70] You are not supposed to ask such
personal questions from somebody.
[302.39] You didn't need to ask about
the age, who will marry when.
[306.39]  All these are their personal matters.
[308.35] Come on, Azmat, I can't sit like a dumb person
when I'm visiting someone.
[313.39] When we visit someone we can't stay quiet.
[316.54] Actually, Shabana should
have started some conversation.
[319.62] My sister doesn't have the habit
to talk uselessly, okay?
[323.69] Wow, now if I have said something
out of courtesy you don't even like that.
[328.05] I am not a fool. I have a good idea
[330.60] why you and your daughter were
displaying so much courtesy.
[334.69] Can't the girl's family
even hint the boy's family?
[337.94] You weren't hinting, in fact you were
announcing  your daughter's qualities.
[341.99] And those qualities
which haven't even touched her.
[345.55] So what? Everyone lies at least this much.
[348.80] Look, my intentions were good.
[352.49] That our daughter gets married.
[355.56] They are such a nice family,
settled people.
[358.62] And every mother wants
that her daughter gets such in laws.
[362.31] Wanting and forcing
are two different things.
[365.84] And tell your daughter too, she was
trying to get noticed too much by Nimra.
[370.48] Tell her to talk less.
[372.91] Azmat, Nosheen is confident,
what's wrong with that?
[376.89] I think you are forgetting
[378.24] that your daughter ran away from
home on the basis of her confidence.
[381.75] I don't get one thing
[384.06] that why do you taunt and tease me
by calling her just my daughter?
[389.02] I didn't bring her from my mother's.
[391.08] She is as much your daughter
as much she is mine.
[394.38] So, when did I deny that?
[396.57] But I have no role in her up
bringing and her character.
[399.73] She is your responsibility.
[401.09] If you want to say any other
bitter thing then please go ahead
[404.18]  or else you might regret, Azmat
[408.31] I didn't mean to fight with you,
just to advise you.
[413.38] I only want to say that you should
avoid to say anything in front of them
[416.38] which can effect Aima's relationship.
[418.56] Azmat I just wanted that Nosheen's marriage
is fixed with her younger son.
[424.02] You've put it in her ears, that's enough.
[428.42] If she is interested
she will express it herself.
[430.96] And for God's sake don't say all
those stupid things again in front of her.
[435.61] She has seen the world,
she knows how to recognize tones.
[441.21] What do you think, did Shabana got Aima's
marriage fixed there by praising her so much?
[446.51] Yeah, she is her relative too.
[448.93] You are Shabana's relative too,
you never thought about them this way.
[456.13] The point is that people
don't look at the relationships.
[459.21] She has seen a lot more in Aima
that you aren't able to see.
[463.03] She's a very wise woman.
[464.84] Anyway, listen, people ask Nosheen
about her education.
[470.66] She gets so embarrassed.
[473.12] People don't even talk properly with
uneducated people let alone get married to.
[478.90] Please, Azmat, let her complete
her education. Let her continue it.
[484.69] Okay, go to her college tomorrow
and get her admitted.
[500.61] -Faiq, let me do it.
-I'm telling you...
[514.87] Aima...
[519.88] I needed to iron my shirt, so, Nosheen...
[524.23] Yeah, I said that I'm going to iron it.
[529.12] Auntie sent me to do it.
[544.98] What's wrong? I scared you a little
and you got scared so much?
[548.58] -Why are you here?
-Isn't this understood?
[551.76] I'm here to tease you, why else?
[555.50] I have talked a lot
with your special someone.
[562.16] What's wrong? Why are you sad?
[564.92] No, I'm not sad.
[567.90] Really but it's shouting out loud
that you're sad.
[571.65] -What?
-Your face, what else?
[580.67] Zaid, it's nothing like that.
[584.43] -Can I ask you something?
-Sure.
[587.41] Why do I have a feeling
that you aren't how you show yourself?
[593.23] What do you mean?
[595.76] I mean, there are a lot of things that
you hide from everyone, even from me.
[603.95] There are a few things
that you have kept inside you.
[607.25] And these things become
the reason of your distress, am I right?
[613.78] Am I wrong? Tell me
what is it that is bothering you?
[619.67] Do you think that Faiq is interested in me?
[624.21] What kind of a question is this?
[626.34] You wanted to know, didn't you?
Then answer me.
[630.21] Of course he's interested in you.
[635.00] Okay, but how can you say that?
[638.70] Because Faiq has told me himself that
he likes you and wants to know you more.
[643.98] He is really excited
about this relationship.
[647.20] What's wrong, Aima?
Why are you so uncertain about Faiq?
[651.48] Tell me, share with me everything today.
[653.71] Zaid, I have a feeling
[656.53] that auntie is forcing Faiq
to get married to me, he doesn't like me.
[661.88] -But why do you feel that way?
-Because...
[666.50] because nobody likes me, Zaid.
[669.06] Who told you that?
[671.51] I just feel that way.
[676.34] I'm not that type of a girl
which is liked by anyone.
[679.70] -Are you mad?
-I'm serious, Zaid.
[684.72] I'm not that type of girls which guys like.
[687.20] Okay, and what kind of girls do guys like?
Would you like to bother telling me that?
[692.76] Whatever kind they like,
they aren't like me at least.
[697.48] Aima, you are absolutely wrong, in fact
you are a girl which every guy would like.
[702.53] Would want to make you his life partner.
[704.52] If that's the case,
why didn't you like me, Zaid?
[711.70] -I, I just...
-I didn't mean to say that.
[719.67] I meant that guys like
[722.52] vivid and lively girls
who are very expressive.
[731.04] I've got a simple nature.
[734.66] Let me tell you one thing, Aima,
[738.34] every other girl is vivid,
talkative and expressive.
[742.25] But there are very less girls
who are like you.
[746.55] I mean, have you ever looked at yourself?
[749.10] You're so intelligent,
educated, well behaved.
[754.53] And forget all that, the most important
thing is that you are a caring person.
[758.83] How can anybody not like a girl like you?
[765.73] A girl, who understands the feelings
and emotions of the other.
[769.52] Doesn't leave him in bad times.
[772.38] Anybody can pretend to be vivid.
[775.07] One can deceive other. But being caring
is part of someone's nature.
[781.35] And your nature is like that.
[783.93] So please, stop pitying
and feeling sorry for yourself
[789.93] and go talk to Faiq.
[791.50] He likes you a lot, if you won't talk
to him how will you know?
[794.63] Even I talk to him more than you.
[799.93] Got it?
[811.80] Oh, show me, what texts are you getting?
[816.77] Hey!
[818.63] Go ahead, talk to him so that you know
how special you are to him.
[825.30] Go ahead, reply him.
[833.59] I need a little privacy.
[836.30] Sure, you can have
all the privacy you need.
[859.19] Nosheen, everything all right?
You called so early in the morning?
[861.51] Yeah, actually I was getting bored,
so I thought of calling you.
[866.26] -Actually, Nosheen I...
-Can I address you casually?
[869.51] Right? We're friends now.
[872.10] No, actually I was waiting for Aima's call.
[877.77] So, that's why...
[879.74] Okay, so when shall I call you?
[882.15] Okay, listen, I'm a little busy these days
so I can't talk to you daily, okay?
[888.97] Bye.
[900.27] Is my son talking to his would be bride?
[903.72] No, Mom, Nosheen was calling.
[907.80] Nosheen? Brother Azmat's son?
[910.55] -Yes.
-But Faiq, why is she calling you.
[914.30] Mom, she keeps calling,
she is a bit frank in nature.
[917.73] She keeps joking around,
and she's a bit dumb too.
[920.68] She isn't dumb but a very clever girl.
[923.40] She is very cunning.
[926.80] I observed even that day at the party,
she was trying to get too frank with you.
[932.26] And I'll advise you to avoid her.
[935.18] The kind of relation you both have,
her frankness with you isn't good.
[939.72] Do you get what I'm saying?
[942.10] Yes, Mom, I get you, don't worry.
And I'm not a small kid.
[947.49] You are still a kid to me.
[953.62] Faiq, I'm really worried about Aima.
[956.36] Why, Mom? What's wrong with her?
[958.58] No, nothing happened as such,
but she seemed really low that day.
[973.77] It seemed as if she is unhappy.
[976.18] -Really?
-Did you notice it too?
[980.75] I don't know, Mom. I didn't have
much interaction with her that day.
[984.39] Faiq, tell me clearly. Did anything happen
between you guys that day?
[989.20] No, Mom, nothing as such happened.
[991.12] She doesn't seem happy to me at all.
[997.16] And to tell you the truth,
you don't seem satisfied as well.
[1001.60] I think you both need to sit together,
you need to know each other.
[1007.86] Mom, I think she won't be
much comfortable in meeting me alone.
[1011.74] She wasn't talking to me at the dinner too.
[1013.87] Well, okay then, ask her how will
she feel comfortable in talking??
[1019.67] If you say may I call her home?
[1024.12] Yeah, that would be rally nice.
[1026.62] You both can spend time with each other
easily and talk to each other too.
[1030.94] Okay, Mom, I'll talk to her about it.
[1034.45] Faiq, look dear, whatever doubts
a girl has before getting married
[1039.94] only her would be husband can remove it.
[1043.20] And it's your responsibility
to remove all her doubts.
[1047.73] Mom, don't worry
everything is going to be fine.
[1052.00] -With God's will.
-Come, let's go.
[1060.06] Hello, yeah this is Zoya.
[1063.65] okay, I'll reach in an hour and then
we can discuss it with each other.
[1070.59] Okay? Thank you, bye.
[1075.88] Whose call was it, Zoya?
[1078.77] Mom, I'm going to Dubai for a shoot.
[1083.25] Dubai? How are you going
to Dubai all of a sudden?
[1088.62] Mom, do you remember I went for
an audition a couple of months back?
[1092.43] So they have liked my portfolio a lot.
[1094.64] So I just got a call from them.
[1097.09] And it's a multi-national company, 
and I've got a lead role in it.
[1100.50] So, I'm going to Dubai.
[1103.16] I have to go sign 
the contract with the client.
[1106.30] Can you please ask the driver 
to get the car ready?
[1109.34] Okay, I'll tell him to.
[1114.15] Zoya, may I say something?
[1117.56] Yeah, I'm ready to listen 
to anything you say right now.
[1122.16] You should tell Zaid 
about it before leaving.
[1128.91] Mom, I have a lot of things to do
right now. I'll tell him when it's time.
[1134.09] No, you should discuss it with him 
before signing the contract.
[1140.94] Mom, until things are finalized, 
I don't want to tell anything to anybody.
[1146.25] But, Zoya, he will mind 
if you won't discuss it with him.
[1150.49] Why would he mind? Besides this is
my personal and professional decision.
[1155.10] And I don't want his opinion in it.
[1157.72] Why don't you try to understand 
that you aren't single anymore.
[1161.98] So what?
[1163.94] Well, so you can't take such 
a big step without asking him.
[1169.09] Mom, please don't say these
typical things to me, all right?
[1173.40] Besides, I agreed to marry Zaid 
because he is aware of my nature.
[1179.63] I know, dear.
[1181.14] But you have to adjust a lot of things,
[1183.62] you have to do a lot of
things against your nature.
[1187.10] Mom, can we end 
this topic right here, please?
[1191.52] Besides, my privacy 
and independence is on priority for me.
[1195.87] And it would be better 
that you do the same.
[1218.28] Get ready,
[1220.32] Don't tell me, have I got a proposal 
from some rich family again?
[1225.05] There is a thing called modesty
and manners. It's nothing like that.
[1230.05] What do I have to prepare for then?
[1232.49] Your dad has given permission
to send you again to college.
[1238.34] Really?
[1242.23] Thank God, dad got back to his senses.
[1245.04] How rude? Aren't you ashamed? 
You say whatever you feel like.
[1250.30] He is your dad.
[1254.62] Yes so? I'm saying the truth. Besides,
one shouldn't keep things in their hearts.
[1259.04] Listen to me carefully, nobody marries 
a rude girl. Specially people from good families.
[1264.91] Nothing as such happens, 
it all depends on fate.
[1267.61] Just look at Aima, 
what an item she has got.
[1270.69] Well, that's true, but one 
can write his own fate too.
[1276.32] Do you know that Nimra 
has a younger son too?
[1279.41] So, are you also thinking about it
that auntie Nimra might choose me...
[1284.32] Yeah, I've been thinking about it 
since the day they came to our place.
[1289.17] Mama, you're so clever too.
[1293.03] But Nosheen, correct yourself.
She won't even pay any heed to you
[1296.71] if you don't correct you habits.
[1299.12] So do you want me to change
right now in the hope that one day
[1303.22] auntie Nimra is going to send a proposal 
for me for her son in Canada.
[1307.23] Yeah, why not? She likes girls like Aima.
[1310.33] Naive, simple and skillful kind.
[1313.04] Oh, what's going on, since when 
have you started praising her?
[1317.65] Nosheen, what's true is true. Wherever this
girl goes, everyone starts praising her.
[1323.85] So do you want me to become Aima?
[1326.10] Yeah, make her your target.
[1328.72] If you are able to do that, then it
would be easier for me to trap Nimra.
[1337.35] What's wrong? You used to say I'm going 
to prove this and prove that.
[1343.78] I can do a lot of things, 
just let my time come.
[1353.90] Yeah, Shabana, please come, sit.
[1357.54] Yes, brother, you called me?
[1359.38] I've called you because you still haven't
given me the list of stuff for dowry.
[1364.04] I forgot to tell you, sister Nimra called.
[1368.56] She was saying that
 she didn't like it at all.
[1372.38] -Didn't like what?
-Te thing about dowry.
[1374.69] I didn't get it.
[1376.49] Actually she wants us to just marry
Aima. She said she doesn't need any dowry.
[1382.32] And we will take care 
of everything that Aima needs.
[1386.27] That's their greatness, 
but we can't send Aima empty-handed.
[1391.48] God has made us able to do that.
[1394.02] Aima has got some wishes too.
[1396.19] We're going to make proper arrangements.
[1399.04] Yes, brother, I'm thinking the same.
[1402.81] Just don't worry 
and do the preparations, okay?
[1405.49] -But brother, sister Nimra...
-I'll explain her myself over the phone.
[1408.86] It's her goodness,
she is talking so nicely.
[1411.64] People with large-heartedness 
are like that.
[1413.71] But just think for yourself, if a
person has to go even on a journey,
[1416.29] he keeps a pair of dresses
and a few things that he needs.
[1419.20] And this is the journey of life.
[1421.34] Don't worry.
[1423.22] Aima's preparations are going to be great.
[1425.82] Okay, brother.
[1449.54] Hello. You are smiling a lot today,
any specific reason of this happiness?
[1454.77] -Not really.
-Tell me.
[1458.78] It just seems like I am less burdened now.
[1464.26] Would you like to tell 
why you feel that way?
[1469.74] I was angry with Faiq, over a small thing.
[1477.59] I liked it that he tried to appease me.
[1481.13] And there are no more
misunderstandings between us.
[1485.82] Congratulations, this means the relationship
between you two has officially started.
[1490.56] It was official earlier as well.
[1492.18] No relationship doesn't mean 
to be engaged only.
[1498.36] It's a very difficult relation.
[1501.03] Not everything is
good in it all the time.
[1503.64] You know, you get
misunderstanding and problems in it.
[1507.66] You can say that at times of
peace being happy together
[1510.23] and at times of distress
finding a solution together
[1512.75]  is the sign of a good relationship.
[1515.63] It's difficult, but if you have the support
of the other person then it's doable.
[1519.93] But I'm glad that you guys have started 
to understand each other.
[1524.79] You tell me, did you and Zoya 
have your understanding yet?
[1533.38] We always had our understanding.
[1536.98] You know, at times I feel I'm very lucky.
[1542.56] And what's the reason behind it?
[1549.09] She's just too chill.
[1550.56] I mean there never comes a point between
us where there is a misunderstanding.
[1559.37] She's the best.
[1565.37] I'm happy for you both.
[1570.96] And I'm happy for you both.
[1578.44] So tell me
[1582.02] did Faiq send any gift?
[1586.77] The way you're smiling, 
I think there is something fishy.
[1596.23] Come, come dear, sit down.
[1599.80] What brought you here today?
[1601.24] I was just passing by so
thought of meeting Zoya.
[1604.97] Meet your auntie too sometimes.
[1611.56] I don't see Zoya,
[1616.58] -She has gone somewhere. She had got a call.
-Everything okay?
[1621.41] Oh, I think she had applies somewhere.
[1624.44] Yeah, related to modeling.
[1627.89] She was in a hurry so she 
didn't tell any details to me.
[1630.55] That's rude that she didn't tell you.
[1633.09] No, she was calling you. 
She called you many times.
[1637.41] I think there was an issue 
with the signal so it didn't connect.
[1641.32] Any idea when she will be back?
[1643.77] In a while, just stay, wait 
for her, she'll be back soon.
[1649.88] By the way, it's good 
that you have come today.
[1654.37] I had to talk to you 
about something important.
[1656.89] Yeah, sure, please go ahead.
[1658.93] Can you please take out time 
and visit my office some day?
[1662.98] I wanted you to meet the lawyer.
[1665.27] Regarding what?
[1668.24] You know well that after me, 
all of this is Zoya's.
[1671.81] And that girl just doesn't get serious, 
neither she has got any knowledge.
[1677.67] Okay, but why are you telling me all this?
[1681.30] Zaid you are my son.
[1683.93] And you've got knowledge, you are mature. 
You understand everything.
[1689.69] I just wanted you to visit my office
so that you can meet my lawyer
[1692.53]  and he can explain you the details.
[1695.45] Okay, I'll visit.
[1697.92] Tell me, when are you coming 
to the designer with me?
[1701.72] Yeah, I had thought about it 
but honestly I didn't get time.
[1706.90] Let's go this weekend, there's just 
a month left in the wedding.
[1711.57] Okay, sure, let's finalize it this weekend.
[1714.60] So, tell me, what preparations 
are going on at your home?
[1718.48] Wedding preparations 
are going on in full swing.
[1721.86] Very good. Okay let me get something
for you, just wait. I'll be right back.
[1727.14] Sure.
[1743.18] -Hello, how are you doing?
-I'm good, how are you?
[1748.64] I'm good too, in fact 
mom says that I'm too good.
[1756.07] -Why? Ain't I good?
-You are good,
[1760.79] anyway, tell me what's up?
[1763.40] Nothing much, was just getting bored.
[1766.23] Really? And I thought 
that you must be missing me.
[1772.97] Oh, that's understood. 
I miss you all the time.
[1778.45] You tell me, why did call me?
[1783.05] -Just like that.
-Tell me, why did you call me, how did you call me?
[1789.07] With my phone.
[1791.94] Means you feel like joking, right?
[1795.85] Aima, don't hide your feelings.
[1798.32] Tell me honestly, were you missing me?
[1803.80] Yeah, I was missing you.
[1806.38] I really like how you called me like this.
[1809.34] Thank you.
[1811.47] Do call me when you can.
[1814.79] Okay tell me, what do you want 
for your wedding night gift?
[1818.75] How can I tell that, Faiq? 
You can give whatever you like.
[1825.11] No, I want to give you what you like.
[1832.65] I'll have to think about that then.
[1837.30] Well, then think about it, 
what's the problem in it?
[1840.43] Fine.
[1860.10] Oh, sorry, I know that
you don't like these
[1863.02] papers and files lying
around in the bedroom.
[1865.80] But as the study was being cleaned,
so I thought of sitting here and work.
[1870.51] What file is it?
[1872.54] I was about to tell you. 
There's nothing to hide from you.
[1877.66] You know how much I love Aima.
[1880.70] I have always treated her 
like my own child.
[1886.33] Now that she is going away from this
house, it's my right on her that I send her
[1890.44]  as I planned to send my own daughter.
[1896.19] But it couldn't happen 
with Nosheen as I planned.
[1902.84] Anyway, forget that.
[1905.69] I have booked an apartment for Aima.
[1912.16] And I've opened a bank
account for her personal use.
[1915.96] So, these are all the documents for those.
[1919.74] We are not going to be 
with them all their lives.
[1925.68] What happened? You didn't like it?
[1929.75] You are telling us to exclude from the
house and you think I'm going to like it?
[1935.13] What are you talking about?
[1936.38] Mr. Azmat tell me, are you 
saying all that in your senses?
[1941.82] What is it that I said that you 
are taunting me about my senses?
[1945.38] You are telling me that you are going to
spend all your money on this mother daughter.
[1948.74] When did I say that?
[1950.17] I'm giving Aima 
what I planned to give Nosheen.
[1953.59] Just stop it. Till when are you going 
to use Nosheen as an excuse?
[1962.73] Oh, hello! What a surprise!
[1967.07] Where have you been, Zoya? 
I've been waiting for you for so long.
[1975.02] Nosheen, what are you doing here?
[1977.53] Faiq I wanted to talk to you about something
important that's why I had to come.
[1982.07] Try to resolve your own problems.
[1986.68] I don't know what is going to happen
to you both when I'll move to my in laws.
[1990.08] We'll wait for you to visit so that
we can place our case in your court.
[1994.17] You have made your dresses for your
brother's wedding with so much difficulty.
[1997.85] Why haven't you made 
any dresses for Aima's wedding?
[2002.22] Let's see if this wedding 
takes place or not.
