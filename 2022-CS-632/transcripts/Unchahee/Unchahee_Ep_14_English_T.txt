[0.00] From flowers and from buds
[4.60] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.19] When I saw you
[17.62] I learned how to chirp from you
[19.00] -What is wrong with mother?
-She has had a major heart attack.
[22.42] We will have to do her angiography, so that
we can know how many arteries are blocked.
[27.70] Major heart attack?
[30.06] -He likes a girl called Kinza.
-Really?
[33.43] My would-be sister-in-law's name is Kinza?
[36.26] Doctor has told Shabana not to talk much.
[39.21] May be that's why Aima said this to you.
[42.49] I didn't go to chat either,
it was all the usual.
[46.08] What happened, when it happened
and how it happened, that's it.
[49.52] Kids want to do everything
according to their own wish.
[54.06] They want to make the decisions about
their own lives with full right as well.
[59.67] That's how it is, Dad.
[62.28] Around 100,000/-
[65.07] A hundred thousand? Are you insane, Faisal?
I gave you a fifty thousand few days a go.
[70.83] If it was about 10,000-15,000,
I could have thought of something.
[74.72] I have to clear someone's dues.
[78.11] Who is it and what dues?
[80.29] I  don't know what do you
keep yourself involved into, Faisal.
[82.84] Just tell me if you can arrange
a hundred thousand or not?
[87.30] No.
[89.49] I can't believe this.
[92.53] Are you going to do this with me too?
[94.76] Faisal because of your payments,
my account is already empty.
[101.39] And even last time I had transferred
money to you from Mama's account.
[105.36] Come, on. 100,000/- isn't
a big amount.
[107.78] Besides, look at your dad's business.
[110.05] It might not be a big thing to arrange
a 100,000/- for my dad, for me it is.
[113.70] And why don't you ask you papa?
[116.00] -He has got a lot of money too.
-I haven't asked for options from you.
[121.63] You know it well that me and
my dad don't get along well,
[123.97] and still you say
the same thing every time.
[127.60] Anyway, I think I'll have
to take a loan from the bank.
[131.61] Okay, wait. I'll think of something.
[134.54] I'm going to get caught because of you.
[137.79] Until I'm here, I won't let you
happen anything. Trust me.
[142.32] Tell me one thing, Faisal,
did you pay that guy?
[147.04] -Which guy?
-Faisal, your memory is effected too much.
[152.01] The guy who trapped Aima.
[154.28] Yes, yes. I cleared his payment.
[201.68] And Aima has shown you her real face.
[204.63] She has shown you that we both
are such girls that you don't like.
[209.97] -What do you want?
-Justice.
[212.63] Equality, Dad. You are a man of your words.
[216.73] Then you can't get
a better chance than this, Dad.
[230.78] Dad, Dad I have to talk to you
about something very important.
[239.46] Regarding you marriage?
[244.24] No, Dad, I...
[246.52] I just want to tell you the whole truth.
[250.56] I can't see you angry.
[254.16] I'm not angry with you anymore, Aima.
[257.69] I'm just angry at myself to expect
more than required from you.
[267.01] Dad... Dad, I've...
[271.64] I've always tried
to meet your expectations.
[279.87] I used to think that way too,
a few days ago.
[285.57] But I guess it was a misunderstanding.
[289.69] It's not like that, Dad.
[291.57] I have left your decisions on you.
[295.01] Do whatever you think is better for you.
[298.76] Dad, your experience
[302.49] and principles are respectable for me.
[308.33] I'm satisfied with your decisions too.
[313.23] It sounds really good to listen to it.
[315.76] But this creates a difference
between your word and deed.
[318.92] What deed?
[324.03] The deed which I haven't done?
[328.71] What are you trying to say?
[331.08] That I...
[334.85] I don't love any guy.
[340.62] I didn't even know that guy.
[343.43] Then what was all that, Aima,
that I saw with my own eyes.
[346.34] I don't know, Dad.
[349.77] I have been deceived.
[354.42] Whatever I have done, I did it
because I was compelled to do it.
[359.75] What was the compulsion?
[362.98] That you had to visit
that guy's house to meet him? Tell me?
[370.58] A guy was calling
and messaging me since many days.
[377.47] He was blackmailing me.
[379.82] He sent me some
inappropriate pictures of mine.
[385.31] Looking at which, I got worried.
[389.28] I just went to his flat to get that...
[391.73] You went to that guy's house alone,
to get your pictures?
[396.69] And you didn't even think
that you are doing such a huge mistake?
[400.45] Dad, I got really scared, that's why...
[405.15] Did you talk to Zaid about it?
[409.90] No, Dad.
[413.69] Zaid was unaware of all this.
[416.20] You both have such a strong friendship,
you guys are such good friends,
[420.71] why did you hide it from him then?
[425.29] Go, Aima, just go.
[428.66] I am not going to change
the decision that I have made.
[432.66] Please, Dad.
[435.23] I didn't even know that guy.
[440.95] You can ask Zoya.
[443.42] She is the witness of all this,
she knows everything.
[447.12] I have listened to your witness.
That is enough for me.
[454.64] But unfortunately it's no use
talking about all this.
[457.12] Had you shared it with Zaid,
if you had told him that,
[461.02] then my reaction wouldn't
have been so intense.
[466.59] I should have told Zaid, Dad.
[470.30] At times, you have to bear
the consequences of your mistakes, Aima.
[477.91] Now go from here.
[482.99] Dad...
[486.15] I have made a huge mistake.
[491.65] Please forgive me.
[498.31] Lies, truth, mistakes,
[502.90] what difference does it make?
[505.97] Whatever happened,
we can change that, Aima.
[511.15] I have made some decisions
out of compulsion too.
[517.58] Now go.
[603.01] I can't believe, dad is still not ready
to believe what Aima is saying.
[606.47] Moreover, he refused
to listen to your witness even.
[610.67] Zaid, you did the right thing to stop me.
[614.21] Had uncle said all that in front of me,
I would have felt really bad.
[621.46] I just don't get it why is Dad
considering Aima as a liar?
[626.08] Specially when you are ready
to witness in her favor.
[632.35] The reason is very simple.
Uncle doesn't like me.
[636.28] So... I have always noticed that.
[638.88] Why wouldn't dad like you?
[642.76] I have always felt that way.
And everyone has their own choice.
[649.59] Look, you might be mistaken.
[652.20] I'm not mistaken. I mean,
I have seen him avoiding me.
[656.40] But, anyway,
it's about Aima right now not me, so...
[661.77] I'm just worried, till when
is she going to stay at home,
[665.45] and what is going to happen to her studies?
[669.67] Not for much long.
We'll find a solution soon if God wills.
[673.75] I hope so.
[676.18] Kinza, can't you understand that if a
person isn't replying then he must be busy.
[682.94] Just listen, stop calling
and messaging me right now,
[685.44] I am really worried,
I can't talk right now.
[689.94] All good?
[692.30] Any tension?
[694.88] I don't know,
I just can't see Aima like that.
[698.44] I mean, Zaid, I am worried about her too,
but taking stress is no solution, is it?
[704.85] You're right Zoya, but
[706.97] this is a serious matter for God's sake.
This is about her honor.
[711.32] I just want this issue
to be resolved as soon as possible,
[713.71] and the truth to be revealed.
[715.81] I want that too,
[716.88] but for that we need to keep our
minds cool, so that we can find a solution.
[721.44] So, calm down.
[732.50] Your brother, he is such a weird guy.
[736.45] Why, what happened?
[738.72] I don't know, when I asked him,
he got a call and then he was saying
[744.07] send me the location, tell me the address.
[746.57] And then he barged outside.
[748.17] Why did I become unwanted
[752.71] No one knows that
[758.88] Why did I become unwanted
[763.31] No one knows that
[777.44] Mother.
[784.69] Dear, what have you made?
[789.29] I have made chicken broth for you.
[793.33] What are you doing? Seems like you are
going to get me fat by feeding me so much.
[798.62] That's what I intend to do.
[801.56] Okay, tell me, did you eat anything?
[804.99] No, I'll have dinner when it's served
on the dining table, with everyone else.
[809.00] Why have you made a long face?
Did anything happen?
[812.81] No, Mother, nothing happened.
[820.96] Dear, there comes
a point in a person's life that
[829.61] the person gets helpless.
[832.47] He gets trapped at a dead end.
[835.52] Then he realizes that he has
nothing in his hands.
[843.20] When such a situation comes,
losing hope is not the way out.
[850.67] What shall one do in such a situation?
[853.16] The human is mistaken
to think that he is in control.
[860.56] But it's not like that at all.
[865.17] The only one in control
and the complete one is God only.
[873.23] And whatever God does,
[876.31] He does what's the best for us.
[881.30] Dear, until God makes a decision
[888.38] a person should remain patient
and stand firm.
[896.06] Expect the best from God.
[900.68] He is the real truth.
[902.85] He never lets anyone face injustice.
[906.60] That's the only hope left for me, Mother.
[909.15] Just pray for me.
[913.16] You fool,
[916.07] do you have to ask for that?
[919.60] Dear, if I won't pray for you
who else am I going to pray for then?
[928.38] And a mother's prayer reaches the sky.
[936.88] Okay, Mother, have your broth now
or it will get cold.
[941.29] Okay, sure.
[943.51] But first, I am going to make
my daughter have it first. All right?
[955.37] You don't eat anything yourself,
and you keep asking me, huh?
[961.67] -Come on, now you have it.
-Okay, okay.
[965.63] Okay, I'll have it.
[972.89] Who is it?
[982.69] Who are you? What do you want?
[985.07] Patience. I'll tell you everything
and find out everything too.
[988.95] Look, go away from here or else...
[992.89] You are so tiny,
I am going to bury you alive.
[997.10] Brother, what do you want?
[1000.30] Look, the one you are looking for,
I am not that.
[1003.36] Answer my questions right away
or else it can fire too.
[1008.38] What questions?
[1010.55] -How do you know Aima?
-Aima, who? ???????
[1016.47] -Stop lying!
-I don't know any such girl.
[1020.89] Why are you blackmailing her?
[1027.45] Don't kill me, don't kill me.
[1028.99] Seems like you aren't
going to listen the easy way.
[1032.34] I'll tell you, I'll tell you,
don't kill me. I didn't do it myself.
[1034.57] -Somebody asked me to do it.
-Stop lying!
[1037.77] I'm telling you seriously,
[1038.96] -someone paid me to do this task.
-Who, who paid you?
[1041.85] There is this guy, Faisal.
He is a very cheap man.
[1045.61] -Faisal who?
-There is this guy.
[1048.78] And his girlfriend asked him
to do all this.
[1052.02] -Tell me the name of his girlfriend!
-Name... name.
[1055.92] Narmeen, Natasha, it was something
like that which I heard from Faisal.
[1060.18] Tell me properly or I'll shoot you.
[1062.23] Don't kill me, I'm telling.
Let me remember.
[1065.49] Narmeen, Natasha... what was it? Noreen...
No, no, Nosheen. Yes, her name was Nosheen.
[1072.42] I remember, her name is Nosheen.
[1080.87] -Are you lying?
-No, her name was 100% Nosheen.
[1086.90] If you have got what you want,
then leave. Move it or it might fire.
[1092.37] -Just half of my work is done. Get up.
-Half of the work?
[1095.35] -Get up.
-What else is left?
[1106.43] Mama, didn't you go? You were
going to the boutique, didn't you?
[1109.92] -Yes I was.
-Then?
[1113.12] Your brother, he is such a weird boy.
[1117.52] Why? What happened?
[1119.78] I don't know, when I asked him
he got a call and he was saying
[1125.17] Send me the location, tell me the address.
[1127.58] And then he barged out.
[1131.52] I don't know what is this guy up to.
[1135.11] So, didn't he tell you anything?
[1138.10] That's what I'm angry about.
[1139.89] If the driver was home,
I wouldn't have cared.
[1146.21] Anyway, tell me, is Faisal's family coming?
[1152.80] Yes, he'll send them in a few days.
[1156.15] Listen, Nosheen, does he even intend
to do so, or is he just passing time?
[1162.59] He should have sent his family right away.
[1165.07] Mama, why do you keep talking
against Faisal all the time? I trust him.
[1169.88] Dear, trusting someone isn't enough,
specially when it's about a girl like you.
[1175.11] What do you mean?
[1177.02] Look, think over it,
[1180.32] because whatever you'll say,
your dad is going to agree to it.
[1185.20] Then this is a good thing, Mama.
[1187.60] Nosheen, I just feel that you are
taking your marriage very lightly.
[1192.12] Look, there are a hundred things,
financial position, family.
[1197.71] One has to keep all these things in mind.
[1199.49] Don't worry, the family is nice.
[1202.25] Have you met his family, Nosheen?
[1205.50] No, but I have an idea
after knowing Faisal.
[1211.68] -His father is quite rich, but...
-But?
[1218.19] He doesn't get along too well with his dad.
[1222.73] So what if they don't get along well,
after all he is his son.
[1226.81] He will eventually inherit the property.
[1229.34] Nosheen, not everyone can provide you
a luxurious life like your dad.
[1235.25] If you call living like this as luxurious,
then I don't want to live such a life.
[1239.19] Go ahead, be as thankless as you can.
[1240.89] You will realize the value
of all this after you'll get married.
[1245.17] Yeah, right.
[1248.98] Don't know when this girl
is going to be sensible.
[1285.16] He's not answering the phone.
Why don't you do one thing,
[1288.59] it's too late, you should go home.
[1290.96] I am going to call uncle.
I'll tell him everything.
[1296.78] Don't worry, I've got
a lot of time. Just call!
[1300.31] Okay, brother, why are you shouting?
I'm calling him.
[1306.60] Listen, the guy from whom
we got the task done, is he an okay guy?
[1311.71] Yes, of course. Why, what happened?
Did he say anything.
[1315.08] No, nothing. I was just asking.
[1318.77] Did you call to ask just that?
[1320.79] No, I called to ask
if you have talked to your family.
[1325.56] Nosheen, I've told you, I'll do it.
[1328.24] Faisal, you keep avoiding it, and here
mama is on my nerves asking about it.
[1333.97] Tell me the exact date,
when are you going to bring them?
[1336.05] Look, Nosheen, it's not just you
who is in a hurry, I am in a hurry too.
[1339.67] What's the problem then?
[1341.27] I have talked to my mother, but papa...
[1345.33] What's his problem?
[1346.91] It's not an easy task to convince him.
[1349.28] And only mother can do it.
That's why it's taking so long.
[1352.59] Why can't you convince him?
[1354.39] -Don't you know why?
-When needed, one has to make the donkey...
[1358.16] I'm sorry. I mean he is your real father.
[1363.01] Talk to him, explain him
and bring the proposal to my home.
[1368.81] Sir, I have to tell you a truth.
[1371.93] I have made a huge mistake
because of greed.
[1375.99] Please attend my call.
[1389.93] Yes, uncle. Actually Aima is innocent.
[1394.22] I had blackmailed her.
[1396.76] Someone paid me to do so.
[1400.18] Yes, I edited her pictures. So that
 I can blackmail her and call her to meet her.
[1405.71] Why did I become unwanted
[1410.23] No one knows that
[1414.94] Why did I become unwanted
[1419.48] No one knows that
[1424.77] Listen, did you arrange the money
 that I asked you to arrange?
[1428.82] No, it's difficult to arrange
so much money at once.
[1432.67] Nosheen, please do something.
[1435.09] I actually need them
or else I wouldn't have asked you.
[1437.74] -Take it from your mother.
-Right, I should take it from my mother?
[1441.06] -And who is going to give her the money?
-Tell her to take it from your dad.
[1445.56] If it was that easy,
I wouldn't have asked you.
[1447.69] Anyway, forget it.
[1449.92] I don't get it, why do you
need them so much?
[1453.64] Have you gotten
into some fraud or anything?
[1456.43] -Nosheen, you are doubting me now?
-No I'm just...
[1459.92] Listen to me, if you
can give then it's fine.
[1462.89] Or else I'll arrange it
from somewhere else.
[1464.93] Okay, listen. I'll try to get it
from mama's account.
[1469.91] -Okay, fine.
-Okay, bye.
[1476.58] Say whatever you have to say.
[1478.56] Uncle, I wanted to talk
to you about something.
[1482.82] About Aima. Yes uncle.
[1486.19] Uncle, Aima is innocent.
[1488.77] I had blackmailed her.
[1491.17] Some one paid me to do it.
[1494.66] Yes, I edited her pictures.
[1497.69] So that I can blackmail her
and call her to meet me.
[1500.78] And when she came, I got the pictures
taken secretly and then sent them to you.
[1507.82] Yes, uncle, she is innocent.
[1509.97] Forgive me, uncle, I won't do it again.
[1514.42] -Who asked you to do all this?
-Who asked me?
[1517.90] Uncle, Nosheen and her boyfriend Faisal.
[1524.25] Yes... hello?
[1528.68] Hello?
[1530.85] Uncle isn't saying anything.
[1535.61] He must have no answer.
[1539.82] Are you happy now, brother?
[1544.34] I have done what you asked me to.
[1546.79] You should be happy,
because the thing you have done,
[1551.20] I would have smashed you into mince.
[1555.63] -I'm just being kind to you.
-Thank you, brother. Thank you.
[1573.70] Where did your equality go
 in this matter, Dad?
[1576.35] You humiliated me and mama so much.
[1579.19] The whole house was echoing of your
voice when you were humiliating us.
[1583.61] And today? Today your silence
 is saying something else, Dad.
[1600.99] I feel like we should renovate
the drawing room.
[1608.06] Just to change the look a little.
[1611.29] And we'll get it done soon,
[1614.96] before Faisal brings
the proposal for Nosheen.
[1622.43] Are you even listening
to me since all this time, or not?
[1625.55] You are going to listen to me now.
[1628.45] Everything all right?
[1630.91] Make preparations. Nosheen
is going to get married this week.
[1635.19] What's the rush? You weren't
even ready to listen to Faisal's name.
[1639.92] And now getting her married so soon?
Meet his family first.
[1644.39] You have mentioned that guy's name
for the last time in this house. Got it?
[1650.93] -Nosheen is not going to marry that guy.
-Then?
[1654.33] -I don't know that.
-What do you mean, what are you saying?
[1658.83] I haven't thought who your
daughter is going to get married to,
[1661.54] but she will get married
this week that's decided.
[1664.83] What are you saying, without
seeing the guy, how can she marry?
[1669.40] Whoever is ready
to marry her within a week
[1672.17] and take her away, I will
get her married to him.
[1676.93] That's my final decision.
[1678.92] I don't care who he is, how he is.
[1689.34] Nosheen, pick up the phone.
[1693.41] Come home as soon as you can.
[1696.30] You can say that. It's like a catastrophe.
[1699.67] Yes, come home any way you can.
[1701.67] I'll tell you.
[1704.54] Yes.
[1707.10] Both father and daughter, can't let me
stay at peace even for a single moment.
[1719.90] Mother...
[1723.83] Here , have some.
[1726.80] Careful. Get up and have some water.
[1739.52] Oh, Aima,
[1742.70] lie down. You have been taking care
of me since last night, you must be tired.
[1749.44] No, Mother. I was just talking to God.
[1753.71] That's why I won't get tired.
[1761.59] Besides, I'm at peace now.
[1765.97] My heart has found peace.
[1768.44] I have left everything to God.
[1773.26] That's it.
[1776.90] You don't need to worry now.
[1781.00] He is our Benefactor. 
He'll do what's better for you.
[1786.05] Mother, you go to sleep now. 
I will recite the Qur’an now.
[1792.12] Okay fine.
[1794.41] But I've been trying hard 
to get some sleep,
[1801.35] but I can't sleep.
[1803.55] Shall I massage you?
[1807.74] No, dear.
[1811.28] Dad, you, at this hour?
Everything all right?
[1815.14] -Please come, sit.
-Sit down, sit down.
[1818.04] Brother, is everything all right? 
You're here at this hour?
[1833.90] I have come to apologize from you both.
[1842.52] To tell you the truth, my 
mind wasn't ready to accept it,
[1849.02] that Aima could do such a thing.
[1853.28] But I don't know
[1856.52] I don't know how I doubted her.
[1861.52] I will never forgive my self for that.
[1866.37] What are you talking about, Dad.
[1870.95] Whatever you did, you did it unknowingly.
[1874.13] No, I have done it in being 
fully aware and alert.
[1880.43] I have done it using all my senses.
[1883.26] Brother, just forget it as a mistake,
and we'll forget it too.
[1890.85] No, Shabana, not so easily.
[1902.07] Your hearts may be so vast for me but
[1906.12] for me it isn't so.
[1912.21] And the real agony is that I trusted 
some random person.
[1917.60] I believed on his false evidence,
[1919.83] but I didn't bother to listen
to what my child had to say.
[1926.48] How can this be just a mistake?
[1934.13] You to have full right to complain to me.
[1939.84] No, Dad. I have no complains from you.
[1945.37] Brother, even if you were angry
with us, you didn't stop caring for us.
[1953.24] You didn't taunt us.
[1959.54] You took care of all our needs
and didn't let us short of anything.
[1966.04] Then tell me, brother, how can
we complain you about anything?
[1972.25] Yes, Dad, Mother is right.
[1975.15] No that is you tolerance,
[1980.49] because I have hurt you both a lot.
[1987.01] I have pointed fingers 
at your upbringing, Shabana.
[1991.84] I doubted my child, 
with such a good character.
[1996.73] Aima had to face so much loss 
regarding her studies,
[2000.09] and the reason of your heart attack
was this negligence of mine too.
[2004.70] I...
[2007.53] -Oh, my God!
-I apologize from you two.
[2011.28] -I have hurt you both a lot.
-Dad, please... please don't embarrass us.
[2017.15] -Please.
-No, my child,
[2021.69] I want to repent.
[2024.14] There is a fire inside me,
[2025.83] I am in pain since I have
come to know that I was at fault.
[2033.95] Dad, we, we... we don't want anything.
[2037.35] Just give me back the place 
in your heart that I had lost.
[2041.50] I don't want anything else.
[2044.75] Look, brother, if you want to do
anything for us then forgive yourself.
[2050.15] I would never want 
to see you embarrassed like this.
[2053.02] I don't like seeing you this way at all.
[2065.88] -Dad.
-Brother.
[2067.51] -Mother.
-Brother.
[2070.19] -Please forgive me.
-Please, Dad.
[2074.02] -Forget it.
-Please, enough now, Dad.
[2098.05] Why have I become unwanted
[2102.64] Nobody knows that.
[2107.46] Why have I become unwanted?
[2112.05] Nobody knows that.
[2116.85] At least tell me who is the guy?
[2120.49] How is the family?
[2124.96] Enough, Dad. Enough of your drama.
[2130.22] What do you think? I'll marry and
that too with a boy of your choice?
[2133.52] Stop this nonsense!
[2136.88] I can't believe my eyes,
[2140.91] what I've just seen.
[2144.91] I just don't understand what had gotten
into brother, he never does like that.
[2151.91] Mother, Nosheen must have done 
something wrong.
