From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you -How was the doctor's visit?
-It was all right. The doctor has said that by
grace of God, everything is perfect. You both came at such a good time. Just see what your sister has
got for the baby from the market. Neither you are getting
it, nor anyone else. Everyone is just celebrating
the entry of a new member, that's it. Did you ever thing about
the kid who is yet to come? He is going to watch his parents
fight everyday. How is he going to feel? Are we going to give him this environment? Azmat Hussain is one tough nut. He may give a heart attack to
others but nothing will happen to him. And don't you worry at all. Because Zaid is going
to leave Aima for sure. He has got no other option. Prepare yourself to run around. Sister, brother Azmat, you both are going to become grandparents. Yes, my Zoya is expecting. I just pray to God to keep our
children filled with happiness like this. Your house will be filled with
happiness to with God's will. The happiness of my home
is my daughter, Nosheen. But of course it will increase
when the baby is here. Very nice. Anyway does she keep
resting all the time or helps you out too? No, my daughter in law supports
me and helps me out a lot. I have just asked her
these days to rest a bit. Besides, there is hardly
any work to do in my home. Brother, I just want to say to you, that I have forgiven my
children with all my heart, You clear your heart with
them and forgive them also. Exactly, I was telling him myself
that we should go meet the children. This way we can get
rid of all grudges too. But he takes time in
letting go off his grudges. I can understand. But I am really sorry. I couldn't come to see
you when you got ill. No, not at all. No need to be sorry. You remembered me, that's enough. But still, I came, and that
too on a happy occasion. I thought I will congratulate
too and see you as well. Congratulations to you too. May God give good fate to our kids. -Please carry on, I'll be right back.
-Sure. People have such dads who
forgive their children's mistakes. And here my dad, he isn't even
happy for me on such a big news. He will only be happy when I'll die. Nosheen, what nonsense?
Show some respect towards your dad. Has he ever shown me that he is my dad? Parentâ€™s stature isn't so
great for no reason, mama. They have to forgive their children's
mistake, they have to own them. And my dad, even God forgives us on our mistakes
then what does he think of himself? What are you talking about? What
would your mother in law think? No, Nosheen might be
saying it in the wrong way, but she is saying the right thing. Please tell him to forgive her. See, how good my mother in law is? Neither she makes faces like dad,
nor she keeps scolding me all the time. Even if I commit a mistake, she
explains me in such a good way. What do I do? Whenever I want to do something
good it turns out completely opposite. Everyone has complaints from
me, nobody is happy with me. Everybody hates me. What are you saying? She is just a kid
and kids say anything when they are angry. It doesn't mean at
all that she hates you. Then what shall I do? How will everything get better?
How will everyone be happy? Just have patience, everything is
going to be fine with time. Don't worry. I hope that happens. I am just fed up. Everything is going to
be fine, have faith on God. Don't loose hope from Him. At times He listens right
away and at times he takes time. But whatever He does is better for us. You're right. Look, just try one and bring him our home. This way Nosheen will get happy too. Oh, you're here and I
was looking for you inside. Auntie, who is going to drink this milk? You, who else. Hold it. But I don't even like milk. Whether you like it or
not, you have to drink it. Oh, so now you are going to do all those
things that mother in laws do in dramas? Of course I will. I am
going to do all those things. But usually mother in laws in dramas
and movies are very dangerous. But you aren't like them. Really? How am I then? My opinion about you is changing. Really? I should know to what
my daughter thinks about me? No, I won't tell you now. That's not fair. Anyway, Asim has sent some money for you. Money for me? Why? Well, after all you are his sister in law. Yeah, but why did he send money? He has said that my
sister in law should do a lot of shopping for
herself and the baby. He is so excited. Oh, okay. Yeah, he was saying, no matter
what I will reach here for sure. Of course, the uncle
shall be present here. Of course. He is really happy. Everyone's so happy in your house. 
And look at my family, nobody is happy at all. 
Didn't you see dad? There was no happiness on his face at all. Oh, come on, it's nothing like
that they are very happy too. No, auntie, you don't know
how dad is. When he is happy he doesn't stay
quiet, he expresses his happiness so much. But today... Anyway, don't get sad. Let the baby 
come, first, then you'll see. -Don't know when he is going to be normal.
-Very soon. What can happen after the baby comes? Let him come once, then you'll see
how he becomes everyone's favorite. No, even then Zaid's son will
be more dear to him, you'll see. It's not like that, maternal grandparents
hold their daughter's children very dear. -Auntie, may I ask you something?
-Sure. You said when he will come,
does that mean that you want a boy? Not at all, I said it just like that. In fact, it's my true wish that may God gives you
a beautiful daughter. Just like the moon, like you. And what if I have a son? Even then he shall be like you. Not stubborn like Faiq. Auntie, you like me more than your son. Yeah, that's true. Nosheen, you are actually very dear to me. Auntie, I feel like you say all these
things to make me feel good only. No, Nosheen, you are
honestly very dear to me. Just like Faiq and Asim. Yo have fulfilled my
wish of having a daughter. -Shall I tell you something?
-What? Faiq said  sorry to me. Oh, wow! This means that
idiot is back to his senses. Nosheen, just have a little more patience. Once the baby is born, you'll see,
Faiq will be straight like an arrow and will hover around you only. I hate this girl, I don't like her at all. Please stop it,
Faiq. She is your wife. So what? If I don't
like her then I don't. What can I do about it? Sania, -I'm falling in love with...
-Just stop it, Faiq! Don't you dare say anything stupid. Don't say anything because of which
I don't see you ever again. What is it? Why are you
messaging me when I'm at home? But you weren't with me. Yeah, I was sitting in the lounge. Were you busy with anything important? No. I hope I didn't disturb you. Now, what does that mean? No, I was asking just like that whether I have disturbed you. You have a habit to check my
phone, go ahead, you can check it. No, I was asking just like that. Honestly. Do you want me to
swear upon our unborn child? What is wrong with you? Why do you
keep swearing upon on such petty things? And why do I always
have to give explanations? Can't we have a normal
conversation? I was actually missing you. Anyway, forget it. Tell me, did you go
to your mom's house? How did it go? It was fine. Who was present there? Mama, dad, and we met
auntie too when we were leaving. Anybody else? I mean, did you meet Zaid? No, he wasn't home.
And I didn't even ask about Aima and Zoya. Okay. Faiq, I was thinking of
going for some shopping. Why? Do you need any clothes? No, I don't. Actually, I don't have much
idea about ladies' shopping so, you can go with mom. No, Faiq. You know, 
Asim has sent me money. Yeah, mom was telling me. That's why, I thought we shall
go shopping with that money. I will get something for me and
for something for the baby too. Nosheen, I think I shall get whatever
you want for yourself right now. Isn't it too soon to
buy stuff for the baby? Yeah, you are right. Okay, now you go rest.
In fact you should sleep. Salman will be here in a while. 
I have to meet him. Is it something important? Actually, Salman was
visiting nearby, so, I asked him to come over
and we can meet here. Is there any problem? No. Everything is finalized. Once the interior
is done we'll fix a date for the shoot. Okay. By the way, Sania has done a great job. Are you listening to what I said? Yeah, I'm listening. 
You were praising Sania. Yeah, she came to the restaurant today. -Really, did she?
-Yeah. She came for around ten minutes,
overviewed the work and then left. What time did she come? She came around half
an hour after your left. -Did she say anything about me?
-Yeah we had a little chat. Was she saying anything about me? No, she was only talking about work.
She stood for a while and then left. Okay. What happened? Aren't you talking to her? Don't know, she isn't answering
my calls nor replying to my messages. Why are you calling her? Actually, I was
calling her for work. Her check is ready. But
she isn't taking my calls. I don't even know her
account number. Or if I can call her and ask
how to transfer her amount. Man, why are you getting so
hyper? I was asking you just like that. Salman, I think you are being sarcastic. I think you have become
really possessive regarding Sania. You start fighting without any reason. Actually, don't know what
is wrong with me these days, I am reacting with everyone like this. I can imagine. You have
too much work load too, and then Sania isn't
talking to you either. Yeah, she isn't even talking to me. 
Don't know why. -Shall I talk to Sania if you want?
-What for? -About the check.
-No, I'll talk to her myself. Okay, fine. Just get her check ready. Text me the amount,
 I'll get her check ready. Okay, I'll text you. -Okay, I'll leave now, it's too late.
-No, sit, I'll get some tea made for you. No, it's already too late. 
Your wife must be waiting for you. She must be asleep by now, 
don't worry about her. She must be thinking
that I take all of your time. No, Salman, it's not like that. Please sit, I have to talk to you
about something else too. Regarding to? Actually, Salma, I want that you shall be
aware about the details of my business. What for? No, not for any specific reason. Actually, Asim isn't here too. So, I want a trust worthy
friend to know all the details. Okay. You know, few days ago a friend 
of mine had a heart attack. His family had no clue
about his account details, whether he has any money in them or not. So, that's why I want it. You are right, even my family isn't here. Salman, I say, you should get married now. I am thinking about it. Once I get
settled then I'll get married right away. With God's will. What do you think about it then? How is your health now?
How are you feeling? Don't know. I don't get it. It feels as if something
very bad is about to happen. Nothing as such is going
to happen, with God's will. Your wife and her mother 
have hurt me so much. There is a limit to take revenge. How can they even think about it? Did you talk to Zoya? No, I haven't talked to her. What have you thought about her demands? There is nothing
to think about it. First, of all please relax. Whatever they have asked,
nothing as such is going to happen. What if they don't give up? I assure you, Dad. Just don't worry. Neither I will leave Aima, nor I
will let Zoya do any such thing. Zoya shouldn't have said it. If a person loses his respect in someone
eyes, then no matter how much he tries he can never regain his place. I know, Dad. But I'm sure auntie
must have suggested her to say so. Yeah, but she only listens to her mother. She doesn't want to have
any connection with us. She will do it in future too, whatever
her mother is going to guide her to do. The girls who follow their mother's
suggestions after getting married, they can never think or
understand about right or wrong. They can never take their own decisions. And I think Zoya's case is similar. Youâ€™re right, but don't
worry I'll talk to Zoya. And I'm sure, she'll
understand if I talk to her. -Are you sure?
-Yes, Dad, I'm sure. Please just don't take stress. That's what I'm hoping. Yeah. So, just hope for
the best and pray to God. -Are you free tomorrow?
-Yes, do you want me to do anything? Yeah, I wanted to take some
sweet to Nosheen's house. There is a good news. I feel that
we both should go to her home. Sure, Dad, as you wish. -And, I'm happy about one thing.
-What's that? Nosheen is on good terms
now with her mother in law. Well, that's great. Okay, you take rest,
I'll talk to you later. Okay, sure. Why isn't Zoya picking up? -Hello, Zoya, how are you doing?
-Zoya is asleep already. But why are you calling at this hour? Greetings. Actually, I called to
see how Zoya is doing. How is she? Everything is okay on our side.
You tell me. I'm fine. Strange, you are still  doing fine? I didn't get you, auntie. Oh, I think they didn't tell you anything. what didn't they tell me? Well, let me tell you then. Zoya has told them that she will continue her pregnancy
only when Zaid gives you a divorce. Faisal, what do you think? Am I
going to still get blackmailed by you? Look, I didn't say anything like that. Do one thing, tell anyone
anything you want to. I am not going to be
intimidated by your threats, got it? I never think wrong about you, but it's true that I like
to spend time with you. Is this something that
is acceptable for a wife? Answer me. How can you block me from here? -Faisal, go away from here, I say go away.
-Nosheen, who is it? Greetings, auntie. I'm Faisal. She is only going to stay with
you when you will divorce Aima. -What if I don't do that?
-Up to you. You can forget about Zoya 
and your kid then. -Are you threatening me?
-You can think of it whatever you like. But Zoya is not going to
change her decision now.
