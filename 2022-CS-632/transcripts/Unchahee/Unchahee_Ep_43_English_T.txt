[0.00] From flowers and from buds
[4.54] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.13] When I saw you
[14.07] I learned how to chirp from you
[19.85] Don't you dare bring my
daughter, Nosheen, between all this.
[26.09] I won't tolerate.
[27.90] You mother and daughter
always bring Nosheen in between.
[31.12] Oh, God!
[33.52] Auntie, please leave
before I lose my temper.
[37.40] Oh, so you are going to
kick me out of my own house?
[41.49] This is my house and you
should keep that in your mind.
[47.56] You are supposed to tie it like that, okay?
[51.22] Nice watch. Come on let's go, hurry up.
[53.93] -Get up.
-Okay.
[58.40] You won't give up like that. I'll just give
your number to cyber crime department.
[62.58] Nosheen!
[64.83] -Who?
-It's me, Faisal.
[80.54] Hello?
[82.56] Who is this? Why don't
you talk if you are calling?
[85.67] You must have a lot
of free time but I don't.
[88.98] If you call again then I am going
to give your number to my husband,
[92.58] he is going to talk to you then.
[97.89] Don't know what kind of a looser does such things.
[109.50] You won't give up like that. I am going to
give your number to cyber crime right now.
[113.72] Nosheen.
[115.84] -Who is this?
-Faisal here.
[121.32] Nosheen, please don't hang up.
[123.47] I haven't seen a bigger honorless
and cheap person in my whole life.
[129.97] And what made you think that I
am going to hang up your call?
[134.72] I am going to send you to jail.
Just wait and watch.
[138.26] I understand, Nosheen, you are absolutely
right. I have done a great sin with you.
[145.70] I did wrong to you, but God
did bad to me many more times.
[152.22] Just shut this nonsense and
return each and every paisa of mine.
[158.51] You don't know me well. I am going to
bring your whole family on the streets.
[164.36] Just shut up because I
am not interested in it at all.
[168.69] Return my money.
[190.81] By the way, Salman, you have done
the best thing to return to Pakistan.
[194.53] Well, wherever one is destined
to earn, one has to go there.
[198.27] So have you looked for a job after
getting back, are you doing anything?
[202.09] Yeah, I ave been working for the past two, three
months. I am heading an advertising agency.
[206.73] -Two, three months?
-Yes.
[208.69] -And when did you return?
-It's been around five to six months.
[212.94] Means you are here for past five, six
months and you are telling it to me now?
[216.09] I had no idea that you have moved here.
[218.46] It was when I took your number
from Abbas that I came to know.
[221.85] Salman, that's really sad. I mean
can anyone tell that we are best friends?
[226.69] Well, that implies on you too.
You didn't stay in contact with me either.
[230.86] Well, that's true.
[232.91] People are so much connected with each other
in this age, and we are so disconnected despite that.
[238.55] Anyway, just forget it, now that
I'm back we'll stay connected.
[242.72] Yes, sure, why not.
[244.52] What else, how is life?
[246.78] Yeah, she is fine, and one
more thing, I have gotten married.
[251.56] Oh, really?
[254.33] And you didn't even bother telling
me such a big news. What is this?
[258.11] No it's not like that. What can I
say? There has been a lot of drama.
[263.27] Drama?
[264.52] Yeah, I will tell you in detail
some day, now that you're here.
[267.18] You remember, Faiq,
while in school and college
[270.08] until you didn't tell me everything
what happened during the day
[272.51] you weren't able to digest your food.
[274.41] Obviously, who would I tell if not
you. You were my crime partner too.
[278.47] Well, I was never like you.
[280.47] But you were an always
an accomplice in whatever I did.
[283.60] That's true.
[285.00] By the way, Salman, it's good that you
are back. I was feeling very lonely here.
[290.83] And I badly needed a friend too.
[293.42] Is everything all right?
You don't seem too happy.
[296.49] No I'm all right.
You tell me how is that...
[331.25] Yes, Dad, that's the reason we
had to postpone our flight for a few days.
[336.75] No problem, dear. It's good
till then you both can enjoy together.
[341.86] Aima, are you happy dear?
[346.16] Yes, a lot.
[348.26] It felt really good by listening to you.
[351.30] May God keep you very happy.
[354.18] I truly wish that for you.
[356.53] Thank you, Dad. Do you want
to talk to Zaid? He is right here.
[362.74] No, I'll talk to him later.
I have to go for a meeting right now.
[366.67] Okay, Dad. Take care.
[369.76] You too, take care
and take care of Zaid too.
[375.09] -Good bye.
-Good bye.
[387.39] Get my car ready, please,
and ask the team to reach the site.
[401.84] -I told him.
-Good.
[406.01] -Did you tell Zoya?
-No.
[410.55] -Why?
-Just like that.
[413.34] She must be waiting for your calls.
[415.98] If she is waiting for it so much,
she can call me herself then.
[422.01] Besides, she hung up on me.
[424.11] You both are so stubborn.
[427.72] What can I say to you both?
[430.11] Don't say anything. For now
just think about these three days,
[433.21] where are we going to go
and what are we going to eat.
[437.82] Aima, what happened?
[441.04] Zaid, please call Zoya.
[444.62] What's wrong with you, Aima?
[445.84] Besides this is my and Zoya's
matter why are you getting in between?
[450.11] I am already in between you two.
[452.81] This is destiny, Aima.
[458.75] This is all God's planning.
Nothing is in my or your hands.
[462.41] Yeah, but I had promised Zoya that she is
never going to have any complains from me.
[468.02] What do you think all
this is because of you?
[469.92] Our meeting getting delayed
or her misbehaving with me,
[472.60] you don't have any fault in that.
[474.62] Yeah, but our stay is extended,
[479.34] so if you stay angry with her,
[481.92] she might think that I might
have to do something with it...
[484.59] Aima, please stop blaming yourself.
Nothing is happening because of you.
[527.03] Oh, God, five missed calls!
[529.51] Don't know what this guy wants.
If Faiq sees this he is going to kill me.
[541.85] Don't you get it?
[543.25] My love, I...
[544.64] Shut up, Faisal. I have told you
that I am married now.
[547.86] I know, Nosheen.
But honestly I miss you so much.
[554.09] I have to meet you just once, just once.
[558.11] -Shut your nonsense.
-This is not nonsense, Nosheen.
[562.05] Please meet me just once.
Please, just once.
[565.56] Even I have to meet
you. What do you think?
[568.38] Am I going to let go
off my money so easily?
[571.85] No.
[573.01] You have deceived me, and you
think I am going to spare you for that?
[577.58] I didn't deceive you, Nosheen.
[579.58] Faisal, just hang up now.
[581.67] I honestly have to tell you
about something very important.
[586.64] Listen, nothing you say
is important to me anymore.
[589.98] Just hang up now or else
my mother in law will come.
[593.72] Look, until you agree to meet me
I am not going to hang up.
[597.63] Go to hell.
[601.67] Nosheen, hello? Hello?
[616.33] Oh, God, what should I do?
He has become a curse for me.
[644.79] Zoya, Zaid's flight must have landed.
[655.16] What time was his flight?
[658.45] It must have landed at 7 o'clock.
[662.00] But it's 10:30 now.
[664.97] He should have come by now to pick you up.
[668.60] I am so angry at that boy.
He didn't even call you.
[674.16] I'm asking you something.
[677.42] I didn't get any calls or message from him!
[681.37] And why are you getting on my nerves by asking
me the same question over and over again?
[684.78] He doesn't love me!
[687.88] All that was just a drama.
[690.46] It's nothing like that.
[693.59] Zoya,
[696.31] Zoya, my child.
[699.54] Relax, dear. Everything
is going to be all right.
[707.67] -Everything is going to be fine.
-He doesn't love me.
[748.34] Since you have come to this house,
you have destroyed the peace here.
[753.03] Wow, now you are going to
accuse me when it's all your fault?
[757.56] What does that mean?
[761.49] What is it that we have done to you?
[763.34] That's the thing. Since I have
come here, neither you guys have
[767.87] nor you have made me feel
like I am a new bride.
[787.95] -Where is Nosheen?
-I don't know.
[791.51] What is the problem with you both?
[795.24] You both were fighting last night
so much too, there was so much noise.
[858.32] Hello, Zaid, I was calling you,
why weren't you answering my call?
[863.07] -Greetings, Auntie.
-Greetings.
[866.80] I have asked you something.
Why weren't you receiving my call?
[870.37] I was busy and couldn't attend your call.
[873.05] What was so important
that is more than Zoya's happiness?
[876.35] Did you want something from me?
[877.77] Yeah, I have to talk to you,
come over to my place right now.
[882.90] -I can't come right now, auntie.
-What do you mean by that?
[888.84] Do you think I have no worth at all?
[891.91] Auntie, you can talk to me politely too.
[894.51] Zaid, don't try to teach me manners.
[899.77] I have to talk to you something
important about my daughter.
[902.83] Come to my place right this moment.
[905.60] -Auntie, I told you, I can't come.
-Can't come?
[910.06] Why? Why can't you come?
[915.70] Auntie, try to understand. I can't
come because I am in Islamabad.
[918.16] What? Islamabad? But weren't
you supposed to be back today?
[922.71] Yes, but our meeting has been
postponed, and I am getting back on Monday.
[926.74] -Monday?
-Yes.
[929.18] But you know that you
and Zoya have a flight on Monday.
[933.45] I know, I know. I will reach by 8:00-9:00.
[936.96] Look, Zaid. Keep your word.
[945.04] You must land in Karachi
by 9 'O clock. Understood?
[948.78] Yes.
[964.34] -Greetings, Mom.
-Greetings.
[968.34] You here at this time?
[970.07] Yeah I felt like having lunch
with you guys, so I came.
[973.67] That's really nice, dear.
[975.86] What have you made for lunch?
[977.87] -You know I make only vegetable for me.
-Okay, and what did Nosheen make?
[984.10] Nosheen, isn't home.
[987.43] What do you mean? Has she gone
 somewhere today as well?
[990.18] She goes away almost everyday.
[995.89] Did she say something before leaving?
[998.35] No, I was in the washroom, when
I came out she had already left.
[1010.94] Where are you?
[1013.10] Why do you go to your
mother's home everyday?
[1020.63] When will you be back?
[1032.22] Just shut this nonsense and
return each and every paisa of mine.
[1036.08] You don't know me well. I am going to
bring your whole family on the streets.
[1041.98] Just shut up because I
am not interested in it at all.
[1046.29] Return my money.
[1052.12] Mom, I'll freshen up then we
will have lunch together, okay?
[1056.39] Okay, son.
[1063.76] To tell you the truth, Nosheen,
I am missing you so much.
[1068.07] Aren't you ashamed even a little?
[1069.35] Even after what you have done to me, you
are saying all this nonsense?
[1073.74] That is the truth.
If I hadn't had this problem
[1079.28] I would have never deceived you.
[1081.63] Nosheen, I love you so much.
[1084.22] Shut up, don't say all this nonsense to me.
[1086.78] And try to trap those with these stupid
love promises who may believe you.
[1092.50] I have only come to meet you
so that you return my money.
[1097.60] I will return it, Nosheen. I promise I am
going to return each and every penny of yours.
[1104.14] But please pray for me. I am
honestly stuck very badly right now.
[1108.12] I don't care if you get stuck or die.
[1111.17] I have got nothing to do with you.
[1115.93] And I wish that your family has
to pay for what you have done too.
[1123.11] It's already done.
We have been through very bad times.
[1127.21] You will be surprised when you will hear it.
[1132.71] -Because I know that we both love each...
-Enough, just shut up!
[1136.37] I love my husband only.
[1141.06] And you know what? I am not even
interested in your useless stories.
[1147.29] But, Nosheen, I can't
love anyone else than you.
[1152.29] Go to hell.
[1155.39] I don't care.
[1156.82] And just don't take me wrong
that I have come here for any other reason.
[1160.18] I have only come here so that
you return my money within a week.
[1164.51] -And if you don't do it then...
-I will do it, I promise I will, but...
[1171.67] Not a month, at least
give me time for a month.
[1176.37] I will return all your money.
[1177.93] Okay, fine. Arrange my money
within a month and return it to me.
[1185.49] -Listen, Nosheen.
-What now?
[1190.07] Actually,
[1192.46] can you lend me some money?
[1195.54] What? Have you lost your mind?
[1219.75] Nosheen's mother is here.
[1222.69] Okay.
[1243.71] Here, have some tea.
[1248.69] -What are you doing?
-I'm tracing her location.
[1252.92] What's the use of all this?
You are getting hyper for no reason.
[1256.71] You think I am getting hyper for no reason?
[1258.91] I didn’t mean to say that.
All I meant is that
[1264.42] I can understand that you are frustrated.
[1266.49] -But she is your wife.
-Exactly, she is my wife. And I have to find out.
[1272.56] Don't know what this girl is involved into.
[1274.64] You are over-thinking.
[1276.30] Why shouldn't I over-think?
Haven't you seen what she is doing?
[1280.47] She might have gone to some friend.
[1283.15] Look, Salman, if she had gone to
her friend, she didn't need to lie to me.
[1287.62] -I don't know. She might have some reason.
-To lie?
[1291.78] She might be afraid that you are going
to scold her, that's why she lied to you.
[1296.18] Come on man, it's not like I
am a cruel person and hit her
[1299.11] that she is going to hide things from me.
[1300.86] Anyway, forget it. Have your tea.
It's getting cold.
[1305.41] -My blood is boiling over that girl.
-What did her mother say?
[1309.29] All sorts of useless things,
which don't make any sense.
[1314.66] Right.
[1315.86] I was furious, but I just
controlled myself in front of her.
[1320.22] That was right of you.
[1321.97] She must have had no idea either
that's why she came to your place.
[1326.17] -She must have felt so awkward.
-I don't know, all this is her upbringing only.
[1333.91] And you know what, I don't like Nosheen's
mother that much in her family either.
[1338.62] Look, Faiq, I'd say
you shouldn't give such harsh reaction.
[1342.34] You mean you want me to ask Nosheen
that Nosheen, where have you been?
[1347.29] I was getting so worried about you.
Yeah, do you want that?
[1350.10] I don't want that at all. I'm just
saying that stay calm right now.
[1353.90] It is possible that she might
have a genuine reason.
[1360.14] For now, just have your tea and go home.
[1365.53] Auntie must be getting worried about you.
[1368.96] No, I won't go home right now. If I go now
then honestly I am going to end everything.
[1374.86] Man!
[1378.00] Okay, just drink your tea,
it's getting cold.
[1381.65] Drink it, man.
[1396.80] -Zaid, you scared that manager.
-Wasn't it so much fun?
[1401.89] He was actually, shivering.
[1403.69] When he said that there is no mattress
available I thought of doing a little mischief.
[1407.76] You're so mean.
[1409.23] By the way, just call him
and tell him not to get the mattress
[1411.69]  or else he might buy
it and send it over to the room.
[1412.98] Okay.
[1415.38] Aima! What happened?
[1418.11] -Show me.
-Zaid, something has pricked me here.
[1421.20] -Wait, wait a second. Hey Wait, please.
-No, please!
[1424.09] I see it, it's a little...
[1426.48] It was this.
[1429.82] -Is it better now?
-Yeah. Please.
[1432.12] Put your foot down.
[1436.76] I'm going to call them and complain,
they haven't cleaned it here properly.
[1440.10] No, please, leave it.
[1445.26] Why are you crying? I just took
out the glass. Does it still hurt?
[1449.70] No.
[1451.12] -Then why are you crying?
-Zaid,
[1456.32] -Can I ask something from you?
-Yeah, sure tell me.
[1463.03] Your ignorance hurts me a lot.
[1473.03] Can't you stay with me like this?
[1480.19] I don't want anything else.
[1482.26] From flowers and from buds
[1486.82] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[1491.47] When I saw you
[1496.51] I learned to chirp from you
[1500.98] When life starts to test you
[1524.28] -Faiq, auntie is calling.
-I don't want to talk to anyone.
[1528.41] What is this childish behavior?
[1530.86] I said I don't want to talk to anyone.
[1533.51] Why are you punishing
auntie because of her.
[1536.24] Look, Salman, mom knows very well that
when I'm angry I react in the same way.
[1542.08] She knows it, but right
now she is getting worried.
[1545.89] I will leave in a while. Right now I
don't feel like looking at Nosheen.
[1550.21] What is this childish behavior?
[1553.23] What do you want? If you want
me to leave from here I will leave.
[1556.27] I didn't mean that at all. You are taking out
someone else's frustration on someone else.
[1564.13] I'm just trying to explain you and
in return you are fighting with me,
[1567.33]  what's wrong with you?
[1568.88] I have gone mad. Since the day this
girl has entered my life I have gone mad.
[1574.89] You can't punish everyone
because of a single person.
[1581.00] Faiq, what's wrong?
[1584.78] What can one say. He is hopeless.
[1597.03] Hello, Mira. Listen if my husband calls 
or I call you
[1601.64] then please say that I was with you today.
[1605.09] Please, can you preach me
later on, just do as I say right now.
[1610.39] Okay, listen, I'm hanging up.
Just don't mess up, okay bye.
[1619.72] It's 10 'O clock, don't know where
this guy is. I am really worried.
[1653.68] Faiq, I have been calling you
for so long, where have you been?
[1658.00] I went for some work, Mom.
[1659.84] Just listen to me.
[1661.86] Mom, please, don't ask me to be patient.
[1666.96] I am going to make a final
decision about this girl today.
[1669.19] Don't get so emotional.
[1670.98] Mom, what are you trying to say?
[1672.58] She is cheating on me and I
should be gentle with with her?
[1675.16] I'm just saying that at least
listen to her patiently first...
[1678.08] Please, Mom, I can't
be polite to her anymore.
[1680.75] -But still...
-What's wrong? What are you guys arguing about?
[1684.77] -Should I tell you? Should I tell you what...
-No!
[1687.59] Faiq, is this the way to talk?
[1690.44] You don't see her rather stopping me, who has
done wrong and still doesn't accepting it.
[1694.76] -What have I done?
-What have you done?
[1699.12] Where do you go by telling us that
you are going to your mother's place?
[1703.09] I went to meet my friend.
[1705.86] And who will tell us that you are telling
the truth? Because I don't trust you at all.
[1711.97] Here, I have her umber in my phone. Just dial
it and ask her whom I was with today. Dial it.
[1719.01] Take it away, I don't
want to talk to anyone.
[1722.20] Okay, fine, then don't.
Mom, please tell him.
[1728.23] Faiq, whenever a person talks
in anger, he says wrong things.
[1735.07] We will sit calmly and talk in detail.
[1740.37] Besides, this is just the first time.
[1743.08] Not the first time, 
but it has happened the last time.
[1748.16] And if I see it happening again then just pack
your bags and go to your mom's, understood?
[1785.20] Who is calling you this late?
[1788.19] Faiq, it's mama.
