From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you I want that you too should forgive Nosheen. You have a very big heart, Aima. A person who made sure
that you should get humiliated, you forgave her without
giving it a second thought? I actually want to help you
with everything. Of course, you both are going
to help me happily. Because my Nosheen is going away
from this house. Rather she is being kicked out
of this house. Auntie, usually you give the news
from whole world to mom. But you didn't tell her what your
daughter, Nosheen has done. Amber, don't believe
any rumors that you hear. Okay, I'm coming. Oh, I'm such a fool. Do one thing, send her
to me while you leave. -Who?
-Nosheen, who else? Do you want something from her? Before she leaves, I want her
to clear her heart from my side. I don't want her to think of me
as a cruel person forever. She needs to see my softer side now. That's why I’m calling her. She didn't have a few things
like cosmetics so maybe she went to get that. Oh, cosmetic is left. What do you mean by maybe?
Didn't she tell you before she left? Maybe she couldn't find me
so that she could tell me. I'll send her. You're just amazing. You stay at home
and still you have no clue. Saying maybe on everything. What sort of house is this?
No light is working, nor any fan. There is just one fan
even that is of no use. This is such an old house. Doesn’t seem like anyone lives here. This Faisal, don’t know
where he has gone after dropping me. He can’t do anything properly. And he has even asked me
to switch my phone of. It''s 9:00 pm. Nosheen is still missing. I’m so frightened. Sister, please don’t worry. When one goes out for shopping,
it takes a little more time sometimes. What kind of shopping is it.
She has been gone before I even woke up. She still isn’t back, Shabana. Did you call Nosheen? Her phone is switched off. Phone''s switched off? Oh, God! What if someone
has stolen her cell phone? -What if some has taken her...
-God forbid. Sister... Say positive things. Being positive right now
is like deceiving oneself. I’m saying what I feel. May God protect Nosheen. Don’t worry. I keep praying
for every member of this house. I just hope she gets back
before Azmat arrives, or else... only I know what Azmat is going to do. And Zaid, I don’t know
where he has been since morning. Actually, Zaid has gone shopping with Aima. Oh, you mother and
daughter... His mother is worried since morning
and he has gone shopping. What are you looking at? Call your
daughter. My head is about to explode. Yes, I’ll call her right away
and tell her to come home. Hurry up. Your daughter is missing since morning. And you’re telling me this now? I thought she is gone shopping,
she’ll return in a while. But she is still not back. It''s 9:00 pm, Mama.
Almost the whole day has passed. There is a limit of being careless,
for God''s sake. You don't even know
when she gets out of home. Do you have a thing called shame? When I asked you to send Nosheen
to me even then you refused. We are seeing this day today just because
of your carelessness and cunningness. Dad, please don’t get angry. Calm down. Just think with a cool mind
what can be done. Mama, did you call her friends and ask? I’ve called everyone,
nobody knows where she is. Some were saying
that I should call that boy too. -What boy?
-Faisal. Oh, God! Come on. -Did you call him?
-I don’t have his number. Zaid, let''s go, we’ll
have to report to the police, we don’t have any other option. Dad, I think we should check
other places first. You know, I don’t want to involve
the police, it''s a really sensitive issue. Where else can she go? I don’t know. I had an idea to track
her location by tracking her phone. But, her phone is switched off. We have already wasted too much time. It''s not right to wait any longer. Whatever you have to do, do it quick. But I think there is no use of all this.
We have to involve the police. Dad, I think before going to the police
station we need to check the hospitals. Okay. Oh, God! My heart is sinking. Oh, God, please protect my daughter. -Zaid, get the car ready, I’m coming.
-Okay, Dad. Now you can cry all you want. I... I’m really scared. Mother, why are you getting worried.
She must be fine. And you’ll see, she will return herself. With God''s will,
everything is going to be fine. But my heart is sinking. I’m really worried. And I can’t help it. Until I’m alive, I am going
to worry in such situations. It''s natural like everyone
else gets worried. I’m sorry, Mother. I didn't mean that. I’m just worried about you. Yes, I know that. I share my sorrow with you. If I’ll keep things to myself then I don’t know what''s going
to happen to me. Yes, Mother, you are right. I don’t know why do I have a feeling that Nosheen has done
something really stupid. I think this time
she has taken a huge step. What do you mean? What step? I wish that what I’m saying
is proven wrong. She gets back home safely. But I have a feeling
that she has left home herself. But why would she do that, Mother? That is not the question.
The question is why wouldn’t she do it? Has she ever listened to
what brother has said. I don’t know why is she crazy
after that guy. But, Mother, Zaid was telling me
that she was ready for this marriage. And she met
the groom''s family very cordially. They liked her too. Even aunty told me
that she is really happy. Dear, it takes a lot of time
to develop one's personality. And it takes even more time to change it. The way Nosheen's nature is nothing can be changed in just two days. And, I already had doubts,
but I didn't say anything. You’re right, Mother. Even I was surprised on her obedience. Maybe she had planned all this earlier. I just wish, I wish all
of it just get's all right. What I’m fearing is proven wrong
and Nosheen gets back home safely. With God''s will. Faisal, where have you brought me?
It's such a weird house. You told me that you are
going to take me to your home, and you have thrown
me in this stupid house. Darling, just listen to me.
Wait for a little while. I don't want to wait. Take me to your home. -I can’t take you.
-What do you mean, you cant take me? You said that your mother knows about us. Try to understand, dear. Who is going to make a girl who has
run away from her home, their honor? Is this what she thinks of me, Faisal? You said that you mother knows about us. I told her. I told her for sure. But I didn't' tell her that I am going
to run off with you. They won't accept you like this. What am I supposed to do now? That''s why I’m telling you to wait
a little. Let me think of something. And why did you run off from home? See, now we are in even more trouble. Faisal, I have left my house,
my parents for you and this is what you have to say to me? Darling, I’m worried about you only. In fact I want to marry you as soon as
possible and take you home honorably. And obviously, this is the house
I could arrange in a hurry. Now, if you don't like it,
or however it is, what could I do? You call this mess a house? I did whatever I could in my capacity. And you know how my financial condition is. You could have hired
a much better place than this. Why didn't you use the money
that I gave you? Darling I’m sorry, but with the money
you gave me, only this could be arranged. So, Faisal, till when is it
going to be this way that you’re gone and I'll wait
for you all day like an idiot? Do you actually want to go to my home? Do you want to do court marriage with me? My Nosheen can't do this.
This is a conspiracy. All this is your conspiracy. You had the keys to my room/ You have stolen my jewelry. And you’ve put the blame on Nosheen. Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that Faisal, getting secretly married like this
doesn't seem right to me. Okay, no issue. I just wanted
to take your opinion. First make arrangements for  my stay. We’ll think about marriage later. There is a nice flat that I know. -Then?
-They are asking for 0.25 million as advance. And you know my condition.
I don't have a single rupee. By the way, how much money
have you brought? Faisal, I haven't brought
any money with me. Just this jewelry It''s decided then. Faisal, I haven’t brought them to sell. But, Nosheen, we'll have to do something. Mama was telling me that Dad has put
some money in my account, but I'm not sure. Why don't you log in to
your account and check. It isn’t confirmed but we can check. Okay then check it out. Five million! Wow, we have hit a jack pot! Sister, have some water. May God never test anyone with their kids. Sister, when God tests us then
he gives ease to us along with it. God will reward us for this difficulty. It''s just tests and tests for me. When will the ease come? When can I live carefree
in this house, like you. At this hour at night, Don't know how would she be. Sister, wherever she'll be,
she'll be in God's protection. I wish that God protects her all the time. Had Hammad been here, he wouldn't
have let any injustice done to Nosheen. He is actually my son, my son. You, just lie down for a while. Take rest for a while. Shut you your eyes. Whenever I shut my eyes,
Nosheen's face appears in front of me. Okay do one thing that take the tablet
you take for anxiety. - Tell me where it is?
-Yes, it's in my drawer. -I'll get it.
-No. I'll get it myself. -Did you open my drawer?
-Me? No, sister, what do I have
to do with your drawer? Did someone come to my room
when I was away? Yes, Nosheen took the keys from me.
She needed something. Is everything all right, sister?
All okay? Sister are you all right? Sister! What's wrong sister? Are you all right? Sister? Sister? Sister, get up. Oh, God! who should I call? Sister, sister! It would be really helpful for us to start. But don't think that I have
my eyes on your money. I'm saying it because your dad
might block your account. So, do one thing,
transfer the money to my account.  Oh, and give the password to me too. -Faisal, Dad has transferred
this money to my account... Wow, that's commendable. You trusted me so much
that you left your family and came to me. And now for such a small amount you
are doubting your would-be husband. Faisal, it's not a small amount,
it's a big amount. No problem. Stay here, spend time.
I have no issues anyway. And yes, don't regret later
when he blocks your account. And me, I can spend my life
in a simple way. No, Faisal, it's not like that.
I don't doubt you. What's your problem then?
Don't you want to stay happy with me? Okay what do I have to do? Nothing much. Just do one thing,
give me your jewelry sets. -And why is that?
-You know this house isn't safe, so I'll keep them at a safe place. And me? What about my safety, Faisal? Oh come on, listen, whatever I'm doing,
I'm doing it for your safety. I'm doing to for both of our betterment.
So, just trust me. Sister, sister! Sister. Are you all right? Here, have some water. Don't know what happened to me. Nosheen? My Nosheen can't do that. This is a conspiracy,
this is a conspiracy by you. You had the keys to my room,
you have stolen my jewelry. And you've put the blame on Nosheen. Sister? For God's sake.
Don't accuse me of such a thing. At least show some consideration. Consideration? What for?
For stabbing me in the back? I trusted you, Shabana,
but you deceived me. Sister, you have given me the keys to your
room before, have I ever done such a thing? That's because you have
never been caught before. You already had evil
intentions, Shabana. I'm telling you that Nosheen
took the keys from me. I didn't even step foot in your room. Stop lying. Don't know since how
long did you have your eyes on them. -How dare you hit my sister?
-Brother, brother, no. -How are you talking to her?
-No, no. -You are accusing her? What is wrong?
-No, no. Are you going to tell what has happened? Brother, I'll tell you. Sister's jewelry has been stolen. There is a catastrophe in our house
today. We have lost everything suddenly. Don't try to negate the reality.
All of this is done by you daughter. She caused harm to those who benefited her. My daughter hasn't done anything. Someone from them trying
to exploit the situation in the house. Don't you dare say something foolish. Stay in your limits or I'll do something
to you that you'll remember all your life. Oh, yes. It is normal
to hit women in this house. You've already hit your daughter,
and now me too... -You are arguing with me again?
-Brother, for God's sake. Listen to your sister. If you want to stay in this house
respectfully, then hold your tongue. Or else I'm going to do that with you that
you'll be out on the streets at this age. No brother. -Shabana, go. Go from here.
-Yes, brother. What I have said to you,
think over it carefully. And do as I say. You have ruined my life. Dad, I have got all his information. And I've asked a few people
to keep an eye on him if they see him. The problem is that he hasn't
gone home for a week. I can't find his mobile number.
Or else, it's a matter of hours. I just don't understand
how did Nosheen take such a step. She trusted such a cheap stranger. But whatever we have to
do, we have to do it quick, because all the arrangements
have been made. We have sent the invitation cards. If we'll be late it's going
to be a huge problem. But don't worry, I'll try my best. No need for that. No need to try. Stop everyone. Dad, what are we going
to tell the groom's family? -I'm going to tell them everything clearly.
-Then what, Dad? This marriage won't happen. The groom's
house is going to be saved from mischief. I'm going to confess in front of them that
I was handing over my problems to you. That guy is going to get married
to a virtuous girl. People will talk about us, despise us. But this agony will be for a few days only.
We won't die everyday. We will be humiliated
for a little while only. -But, Dad, Nosheen?
-Don't take her name in front of me. And you don't need to look for her either. Who has  torn our honor to pieces. -But, Dad, she...
-Stop worrying about her. She has nothing to do with this house now. It's too late, go and get some sleep. Try to do what she wants. After all she agreed to what I asked her.
She accepted my decision happily. So, I want that the rest
is according to her choice. She shouldn't have any complains. She has the support of her brother. But today, Azmat has
crossed all the limits. Why? What did brother Azmat do? I just said something to his sister,
he was about to hit me. Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that Dad is right. Why should
we care about Nosheen? Has Nosheen cared about us,
about our family or our family's honor? I'd say, it's good that she left home
herself. How are we going to face people. We have got rid
of these everyday problems. I know that you are angry right now
and saying all this being emotional. I'm not being emotional, Aima.
I've thought about it all night. Whatever Nosheen has done, she had thought
it out carefully, with proper planning. I'd say that she should get punished
for what she has done. At least don't curse her, Zaid. She is your sister.
Are you going to forget even that? -I guess.
-That's impossible. Impossible? Why is it impossible? Everyone has forgotten brother
Hammad too, haven't they? No one has forgotten
brother Hammad. Everybody misses him
everyday including Dad. And his case a bit different. We all know about where he is,
what is he doing, who has he married. What's the difference between
Nosheen and brother Hammad then? Nosheen is a girl. She is young,
immature and innocent. And we don't know where
that poor girl is right now. Please, Aima. No one is that immature
at the age of 18 but considered as mature. In fact whatever she has done,
she has done it with proper planning,  so please stop defending her. It's our assumption that
she has run off with Faisal. Just imagine, what if
the reality is something else. Look, Zaid, maybe there has been a mishap
with her, maybe it isn't her fault. Anything can happen. Please, Aima, everything is crystal
clear. You want us to close our eyes? Look, I don't mean that at all, Zaid. I just want that you don't give up on her. She is your sister and finding her 
is your responsibility. Responsibility? And what
about her responsibility? I know that she has done very wrong. She has done so wrong that
maybe nothing can be as bad as this. Zaid, I just want you to try your best. Without knowing the whole truth, 
you can't leave her like that. Please, she is your sister. I'll get some coffee for you, 
Zoya must be here any minute now. Oh, God! My child, my daughter. She just got trapped by that cunning man. Sister, please don't cry. Just think about what
you'll have to do next. I am not in a state of mind 
to think about anything. Whatever happens in the house, he makes me responsible for everything. He thinks everything is my fault. Sister, whatever Nosheen has done, you'll
have to bear the consequences for it. After all, you have brought her up Anyway, why do you let your sister-in-law 
say all that to you? She doesn't need anyone's permission.
She has got her brother's support. But today, today Azmat
has crossed all limits. Why? What has he done? I just said something to his sister, 
he was ready to hit me. He threatened to divorce me and what not. Brother Azmat hit you? My daughter hasn't run away 
from home just like that. She was compelled to do so, Amber. It has been a daily routine to hit 
because of these mother and daughter, But you never told that before. I never tell you this, Amber. 
It just slipped out of my mouth today. Anyway, I know that brother Azmat 
is a very short tempered man. But he hits you as well, 
I had no idea about that. A person who can forcibly marry her
daughter to anyone can do anything. I'm telling you, Nosheen
was compelled to do so,  or else she wouldn't
have done it at all. Sister, no matter how short tempered 
brother Azmat is, but Nosheen shouldn't have run off 
from home like that. So she should have gotten married 
to that old guy? There are a million ways to convince. She could have resisted, 
asked for forgiveness, she should have at least
tried to convince him. I don't know what brother Azmat is
going to do with her even if she returns. No one should dare touch my daughter,
enough of forcing her. I won't let it happen anymore. They have done so wrong 
with my innocent daughter. Anyway, sister, she isn't innocent at all. We all know it very well 
what she has done to Aima. Innocent girls don't do things like that. Have you come here to share 
my sorrow or to insult my daughter? Mp, sister, I didn't mean it like that. I know, Amber, you still have a grudge 
for Nosheen in your heart. Today I have come to know that in difficult times, even 
people's loved ones leave them alone. It's nothing like that, sister. 
Stop crying please. We'll think of a solution 
of this problem then. My child. What's wrong, Zaid? 
Did you get any news about Nosheen? Shall I ask you something? Are you angry at Nosheen 
or worried about her? I was worried about her first, 
but I'm angry now. And why are you angry? What stupid question is this? I mean, you can tell me. 
Your anger may release after sharing. The thing she has done to us. She
ruined our dignity, she has deceived us. That too because of that cheap man. Our family's reputation has been tainted
 and it's never going to get off. -Yes, I agree, but she had no other option.
-What do you mean? I mean, uncle was getting
her married to someone else,  and she wanted to marry someone else. This is insane, I mean, 
what could have she done? Zoya, whatever dad was doing 
was for her own good. He has seen the world, he knew 
that Faisal is a scumbag. And Nosheen was only destroying herself 
by being with him. I know that Faisal is a cheap guy, 
but still Nosheen loves him. And no matter how much uncle wants
the best for her he can't do anything. I mean he can't go against her will. What should have dad done then? He should have given her some
time, he should have talked to her, given her options. Instead taking it to his ego 
and do this to her. Oh so now all this is our fault? No, when did I say that? You are making us the
culprit instead of Nosheen? Because it seems so
with what you are saying. Zaid, I'm not defending anyone here. I'm just saying 
that it's not just Nosheen's fault. Right, right. So according to you
she should be given a medal on this, right? What is wrong with you? Zoya, why don't you understand that
me and dad look at the world differently. We just wanted to protect 
a girl of our house. We know the difference between
a noble man and a  scoundrel. Which you guys don't know. And hand Nosheen chosen a noble guy, 
what issue would dad have with it? Just think about it. Why have I become unwanted Nobody knows that Why have I become unwanted Nobody knows that Call Faisal right away, 
or let me talk to him on the phone. What did I tell you? Lower your voice. 
Don't you understand? I won't, what are you going to do? To hell with you both, 
do you think I'm mad? Listen, girl, if you misbehave even once then you will be responsible
for the consequences. You should be thankful that even after this
behaviour your dignity is still intact. Brother, just tell me 
what should I say to her now? Tell her anything. 
Tell her I have left for Dubai. Excellent, you have thought 
of such an international excuse. Yes, she will be at ease 
after knowing about Dubai. Or else if she gets to know that I am here then she will find me and won't
give up until I marry her.
