[0.00] From flowers and from buds
[4.54] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.13] When I saw you
[14.07] I learned how to chirp from you
[18.72] Nosheen, how am I going to
arrange the rest of the money?
[21.96] It's not my problem. Go work
somewhere or beg on the streets.
[30.66] Okay, half the money is fine.
[34.05] My dear, you are too stupid.
But very useful.
[39.63] Not just a hundred thousand, I will mint
hundreds of thousands of rupees from you.
[43.30] -You and Zoya should move to my house.
-Excuse me?
[49.69] What are you talking about, auntie?
[51.47] You want me to leave my home and stay
at your place like a live in son in law?
[54.84] You might have been his friend in school,
[56.04] but now you are openly
having an affair with him.
[58.78] What are you saying?
Are you in your senses?
[60.99] Don't try to be too
innocent. I know everything.
[63.66] The way you are busy on chat and
call, ignoring me, I understand everything.
[67.71] What?
[69.06] Tell me, who is this girl because
of whom you are ignoring me?
[73.32] What are you doing, Nosheen, leave me.
[76.07] Tell your daughter to
stay in good terms with me.
[80.35] She talks back at me,
[82.69] I'm not just her auntie now, I'm her mother
in law. She should at least regard that.
[96.09] Mom knows everything,
she lives under the same roof.
[99.30] She has an idea about
everything, and still she lectures me.
[102.40] That's a good thing.
[104.76] It is good but I can't say much in
front of her, because this was my wish.
[110.22] Anyway, go home and sort it out now.
[113.36] No, I'm not going home.
I have to go for some work.
[120.12] Are you going to Sania's place?
[126.94] I don't know.
[143.35] Okay, so now I'm trying to
guess what's wrong with you?
[150.99] No, nothing.
[153.61] Really?
[155.62] Then why have you made such a long face?
[159.07] Sania, a person can't have
the same mood all the time.
[162.40] Yeah right. But you always stay so
chilled out, what's wrong today?
[167.78] Did your wife throw you out of the house?
[171.39] -You guessed it right, now.
-Oh, no problem.
[175.88] If she threw you out then go back to her.
[181.66] And as soon as you go home,
hold her feet and ask for forgiveness.
[186.63] Say the dear wife please forgive me,
[188.95] I won't let you complain
ever again. Etc, etc.
[196.07] Thank God, finally, at
least you smiled a little.
[201.62] Okay, now tell me, what has happened?
Why are you sitting with a long face?
[206.46] Nothing, I just had a fight with
Nosheen on a petty issue, nothing else.
[211.25] I understand.
[214.16] I don't know why but I'm
feeling very low right now.
[217.95] It's all right, Faiq. It happens. The relationship
of a husband and wife is as such.
[222.72] When you have a fight, it
feels like everything has ended.
[227.15] But everything gets normal
after a while. Just don't worry.
[231.38] -You are saying it of all the people?
-Why not?
[234.55] -And what about your relation?
-Don't talk about my relation, Faiq.
[238.07] and God forbid that your
marriage ends up like mine.
[244.42] A fight among husband and
wife isn't something surprising.
[247.92] Don't get so disappointed.
[249.75] Go home and sort things out.
[252.42] No, not at all. I don't
want to talk to her at all.
[255.63] It's okay. Then give yourself some time.
[258.58] Everything is going to
be fine with God's will.
[261.34] -Hmm.
-What hmm? Be normal now.
[265.31] People are facing so much
problems in their lives,
[267.94] and here you are sitting with a sad
face after a small fight with your wife.
[272.94] -You're right.
-Good.
[275.96] Okay, now tell me what about the
issues you had at your restaurant?
[280.81] -Yeah, that's settling down gradually.
-Good.
[285.69] -Sania, shall I say something?
-Hmm?
[288.34] -I'm feeling better now.
-Thank God.
[292.38] -Thank you.
-Come one now stop it, no need to be so formal.
[297.75] Okay, let's go to my restaurant,
I have some work there too,
[300.99]  we can have dinner there then.
[302.90] Wow, good idea. I'll just go get ready.
[306.89] How much more ready are you
going to get? You are just fine.
[309.49] Oh you, Faiq.
[333.68] Hello, Salman, I'm coming
to the restaurant, okay? Bye.
[343.63] Come, Sania, hurry up.
[356.83] No, Dad, just leave it. Stop it.
[361.61] Till when are you going to
keep asking him to do things?
[365.23] I don't want the forced love
and forced respect.
[372.15] All of it seems fake.
[374.80] -But I was just...
-I know, Dad, that you love me a lot.
[380.63] That's why you keep
reminding him of my rights.
[385.96] But I want to request something to you,
[389.28] please don't force him to do things.
[406.00] Spend some time with me too, at times.
[409.48] So, tell me, what's new?
[414.29] -Everything is in front of you, Dad.
-Means, a life full of work and engagements?
[419.95] -That's it?
-Yeah, I'm trying to manage.
[425.12] Well, that's nice.
[429.43] Tell me, where did you go after work today?
[432.99] -Actually, auntie called me to meet.
-Everything all right?
[436.76] Yes, everything was fine, she just
wanted some advice for her business.
[440.77] Okay, fine. It's good
that you are helping her.
[450.13] Besides, she doesn't have a son.
[453.83] Dad, I wanted to talk
to you about something.
[458.32] Sure, go ahead. I have to talk to you too.
[462.24] But you go first.
[465.61] I was just thinking Dad that
[469.43] for everyone's benefit, I should take
Zoya and move out from here.
[475.04] Move out?
[476.28] Yes, I mean I want to move
to a separate house with her.
[480.75] Have you already decided, or...
[483.19] No, Dad, it's still under consideration,
I came to take advice from you.
[486.81] So, what do you think what is better?
[490.03] Is this the solution to your problems?
[492.44] Yeah, to me this is a good solution.
[498.56] Besides, I'm getting really stressed
out with these everyday problems.
[502.08] You have grown up, you are
responsible too and married too.
[508.78] If you think that this is the
solution to all your problems
[512.40] then okay, you may get a separate home.
[517.08] Dad, honestly, I never wanted
to be separated with you all.
[520.46] But the problems I am going
through since past few days,
[524.41] I think this is the best option
[527.55] And moving to a separate house doesn't
mean at all that I am leaving you guys.
[532.29] Look, this no doubt
that it's a huge decision.
[541.44] I pray to God that may this
decision be beneficial to you.
[545.74] Dad, I hope you have no objection.
[550.81] What objection can I have, son?
[554.68] -I mean you won't get angry, will you?
-No, not at all.
[565.67] You can get a separate home.
[570.16] I have already given too much
trouble to my kids with my decisions.
[577.85] Now you should take your own
decisions, I'm going to support you.
[588.21] Besides, you are not going to follow
your father's decisions all your life.
[596.20] A person has his own decisions too.
Do whatever you find right. I am with you.
[607.18] Always.
[626.06] Mom, I don't believe it.
[627.80] Zaid has told me that he is going
to get a separate home for us.
[632.83] This is so unbelievable.
[636.01] What have you said to him
that he agreed to it so easily?
[641.64] I have been dealing so many people everyday
since so many years.
[647.59] And he is just a kid.
[649.44] I just gave him some sense
and he understood it.
[653.38] That's it?
[654.89] That's why I tell you that if you'll follow
my advise you can tackle Zaid easily.
[661.15] Okay then, start advising me from today.
[669.18] I was just kidding.
[672.68] These things can't be learned
by someone's explaining.
[678.38] But yes, keep it in mind
[681.89] that instead of creating a scene,
deal your husband with patience,
[688.38] And even then if he doesn't listen to you?
Then what?
[693.68] Usually, all men are alike.
[699.66] At times they take time and at times
they listen to their wives right away.
[703.26] But yes, only few of them agree to it.
[707.31] It's not like Zaid doesn't listen to me.
[710.75] But at times I feel that he
prioritize his family over me.
[717.05] Dear, every relation in
a man's life is very important.
[723.96] But the closest relation
is the wife's relationship.
[730.24] But to get what you want,
[732.59] it's very important to see how his
mood is and if it's the right time.
[739.31] Mom, I can't do this family politics.
[743.98] To be honest, you know how blunt I am.
[750.10] If I don't like anything
I say it then and there.
[752.88] I'm not into all this
planning and plotting.
[757.10] That's your biggest mistake.
You do all things bluntly.
[764.35] You know, until your father was
alive, he was totally under my control.
[771.85] Wow, mom, you're so smart!
[775.51] But anyway, my life is going
to be set now. I'm not worried.
[782.89] No, the game has just started.
[787.23] Just wait and watch how I play this game.
[791.70] I have just got the roof separated
now. Then I will get Aima divorced too.
[797.04] so that he doesn't
have any way to return.
[800.07] And then I have to crush
Azmat Hussain's pride.
[803.70] I am going to make him
yearn to even look at his son.
[827.06] Auntie, tell your son to stop.
[829.96] -Is everything all right? What happened?
-Your son is fooling around with girls.
[834.44] How can you say that?
[836.28] Whatever I'm saying is the truth.
[838.01] He keeps talking to girls all day long,
meet them privately and what not.
[842.94] Nosheen, how can you talk
like that about your husband?
[849.67] I'm not just accusing him. I
have proof of all his cheap deeds.
[856.17] Whatever you say, I know
that my Faiq isn't like that.
[861.62] Oh come one, leave it. I know your
son's character more than you do.
[867.18] You can see for yourself.
[868.59] He was supposed to get married
to Aima but still he went after me.
[873.24] Your son walks with
his heart on his sleeve.
[875.73] And it's in his nature to have affairs.
[878.14] I know, Nosheen, that whatever
Faiq did with Aima was very wrong.
[885.53] But he wasn't married then.
He is a married man now.
[890.43] He can't do anything like that.
[892.63] A person's nature doesn't
change after getting married.
[897.45] No, I trust Faiq, he would never do that.
[901.21] You may trust him, but I don't.
[903.33] And didn't you see how he broke
your trust by getting married to me?
[908.62] And still you have so
much hopes from that guy?
[913.25] Anyway, tell your son that if he
does any silly thing with me again,
[917.45] I won't spare him this time.
[920.43] No, Nosheen, there must
be a misunderstanding.
[924.39] Neither I nurture misunderstandings,
nor vain hopes like you.
[928.10] Tell him that I won't spare him this
time if he does anything wrong to me.
[934.13] And I'm not Aima to
tolerate everything quietly.
[937.46] Just tell him that I am going to
ruin his life if he deceives me.
[942.26] I won't let him worthy
enough to face anybody.
[944.14] Understand this yourself too and
make him understand it as well.
[972.65] Hammad has left already, and now him.
[976.91] Aima, no matter how much we try not to
have expectations from our children, but
[983.68] there is something in our
heart which gives us hope,
[988.49] no matter how brave,
how independent they get.
[993.37] It feels this way when
you reach a certain age.
[999.84] But I feel that I don't have the
joy of my children in my fate.
[1006.89] Dad, why are you saying that?
[1009.72] What shall I say then? I am
sharing with you what I'm feeling.
[1014.80] Just don't lose heart.
[1017.89] Because after Hammad left,
I was counting on Zaid.
[1022.47] And now he will leave too.
[1025.71] So, what did he say exactly?
Didn't you stop him?
[1031.92] No, I gave him permission.
[1038.70] He is helpless, Aima. And by stopping
him I can't make it more difficult for him.
[1048.81] And you are the one who made me realized
that there is a lot of pressure on him.
[1053.51] -Dad, I didn't mean that. I was just...
-I'm not blaming you, Aima.
[1058.84] In fact I am happy about the fact that I am
trying to change myself even in this age.
[1066.96] I can feel your pain.
[1069.97] I am not sad because he is leaving, Aima.
[1073.67] I am sad about the fact that we make so
many plans, but something else happens.
[1080.61] And whatever happens,
that is God's planning.
[1084.95] So how can God's planning be wrong?
[1089.04] You are right, even then we humans
get worried if our planning gets disturbed.
[1096.15] That's the weakness of our faith, dad.
[1099.36] We claim that we trust God.
[1104.64] But do we endure his decisions?
[1108.79] Yes, you are right.
[1112.09] Us humans are too weak in this regard.
[1115.94] We lose hope and courage too soon.
[1122.16] Anyway, if he thinks that he is going
to stay happy being apart from me,
[1130.04] then I will be happy in his happiness.
[1133.96] Dad, I will try my best that you
don't feel his absence here at home.
[1142.03] This way your responsibilities will
increase, Aima. They weren't less as is.
[1146.33] Not my responsibility, dad, it's my duty.
[1149.90] Taking care of you, keeping you happy.
[1156.23] What are you thinking?
[1158.61] I'm thinking that
no matter how my life is,
[1164.73] but your life has been ruined because
of my stubbornness and wrong decisions.
[1171.79] To tell you the truth, I felt
[1173.16] that your marriage got called
off because of my daughter.
[1176.71] My son should makeup for it.
[1180.13] I wasn't able to face my sister.
[1183.26] I was afraid that she might...
[1185.00] Anything which happens without
your will is actually God's planning.
[1190.32] Then how can your decision be wrong then?
[1199.06] May be God is taking our test.
[1207.95] But now lead your life with your own will.
[1211.92] I don't want to force
you guys for anything.
[1217.24] I promise you that I am not
going to force anyone from now on.
[1222.91] It's your life, you can take
your life's decision yourself.
[1227.25] Dad, I have no objection
on any of your decisions.
[1231.73] Nor did I ever had.
[1234.26] Whatever decisions you have
taken for me, I am satisfied on them.
[1241.32] And after God,
you are the only one I trust.
[1248.56] No matter if anyone stays with you or not.
[1253.09] Your daughter Aima is
going to stay with you.
[1258.82] Stay blessed.
[1261.34] God bless you.
[1263.26] And, dad, whatever is happening,
[1267.98] maybe it's a trial for us all.
[1273.35] Sometimes God takes our
close relations away from us,
[1279.71] so that they can get even closer to us.
[1300.24] Faisal, for God's sake
stop doing such things.
[1303.87] -That's because I love you.
-I am well aware of the love by you men.
[1308.11] Why, what happened?
[1309.30] All men in the world are
liars, deceitful and cheaters.
[1313.43] Why? Did you husband cheat on you?
[1317.13] If I tell him this, he is going
to blackmail me even more.
[1325.21] No, it's nothing like that.
[1327.54] What is it then? At least tell
me. May be I can help you.
[1332.44] I said, it's nothing. Nothing at all.
[1339.49] It's nothing, but your face
is telling something else.
[1343.19] -I told you Faisal, it's nothing like that.
-Then why do you seem so worried?
[1348.42] -Because of you.
-Because of me?
[1351.88] -But what did I do?
-Why do you call me to meet all the time?
[1358.49] That's because I miss you.
[1360.81] Look, Faisal, these things
won't make any difference now.
[1363.77] I don't want to keep
any relationship with you.
[1366.40] When did I ask you to have
an illicit relationship with you?
[1370.18] Then what are you saying? What
do you want? I just don't get you.
[1374.57] Look, Nosheen I just want
to stay friends with you.
[1377.75] And such a friendship which never ends.
[1380.22] Yes, but I don't want even that.
[1382.94] But I want to, Nosheen.
[1385.54] And that's why you will have to also.
[1387.42] I get it how you are
trying to blackmail me.
[1390.43] No, I swear upon you. I would
never do such a thing with you.
[1395.42] I promise.
[1396.38] Don't you even try thinking about it.
[1398.10] And remember, if I tell my husband about
you, he is going to blow your head off.
[1403.88] Really? You have got me scared.
[1407.07] -Shut up, Faisal, I'm leaving.
-Please, Nosheen, stay for a little longer.
[1410.33] -Faisal, leave my hand, someone might see.
-Come on, just a little more.
[1414.70] Roll down your window.
[1427.55] For God's sake don't say
anything, he is my brother.
[1431.77] Brother? Hello, brother.
[1435.53] Nosheen, who is this? And what's going on?
[1438.91] -Brother, he is a friend.
-We are friends.
[1446.28] Nosheen, get out of the car, right now.
[1477.16] -What is it Nosheen?
-Nothing, brother.
[1480.95] Tell me honestly, who was that boy?
[1484.11] Brother, it's noting. I just got out of
mother's home and met him on my way.
[1489.17] He said, I'll drop you, 
so I just sat with him.
[1493.84] Then why was he
holding your hand?
[1495.45] You are suspecting me for
no reason, it's nothing like that.
[1498.70] He was just joking.
[1500.85] -Nosheen, are you sure?
-Definitely.
[1507.85] Just relax, there is no issue.
[1512.27] Just like a roller coaster.
[1515.64] Look, Nosheen, I still don't believe you.
[1522.28] If there is any problem then
let me know. I'll take care of him.
[1526.55] Come on brother. You get sentimental
over everything. Everything is just fine.
[1532.53] Okay, tell me how is married life?
[1538.06] Is your husband okay?
[1539.39] Really? When you left home,
didn't you think of this then?
[1549.20] You know that I had some issues with dad.
[1553.21] And there are a few other issues
too which I can't tell you right now.
[1557.85] Who doesn't have issues with dad?
[1561.19] Why? Is there any problem again?
[1563.76] Didn't I tell you how dad treated me?
[1567.87] I just had to get married for 
the heck of it, just because of dad.
[1575.20] If he hadn't done all that with me,
I wouldn't have been stuck here.
[1580.83] Nosheen, I am getting really
confused with what you are saying.
[1583.13] I don't understand anything.
[1585.02] Don't get confused. Just
take care of your own life.
[1588.70] Anyway, tell me did your
fights with you wife end or not?
[1596.20] Not the fights,
[1600.99] I have ended my relationship with her.
[1603.15] What? Really?
[1606.25] Nosheen,
[1610.40] this was the only solution I had.
[1612.18] This means all three of us
siblings have a life full of drama?
[1615.30] -What do you mean?
-I mean that Zaid is leaving the home
[1620.29] with Zoya.
[1622.02] What?
[1624.52] Does he have an issue with dad too?
[1627.36] No, not with dad, that poor guy
is stuck between both his wives.
[1632.61] Whoever pulls him wherever, he goes there.
[1636.00] You know what? Actually this is sad.
[1641.23] It's so unfair to Aima.
[1643.57] Well, it's not like that. She jumped into
this pit even after she knew everything.
[1647.81] Why did she have to marry
an already married man?
[1652.38] Yes, but there must be some obligation.
[1655.60] Brother, there wasn’t any obligation.
[1658.20] No matter how much dad would
have insisted, she could have said no.
[1660.44] But she was getting the chance of
her life, why would have she said no?
[1664.38] Aima is not like that, Nosheen.
[1667.60] I don't know why the men in our
home think of Aima as so pious.
[1674.20] It's simple.
[1675.63] She loved Zaid, and when she
got a chance she married him.
[1679.48] Anyway, listen, have you
told anyone about me at home?
[1684.03] No, brother, I have
buried this secret in me.
[1689.63] Thank you.
[1690.88] By the way, brother, why do you
hide that you are in touch with me?
[1696.51] I just don't want that anybody
gets to know anything about me.
[1701.27] So won't you ever return home?
[1710.85] Mother, this girl has lost
her mind, it's nothing else.
[1713.45] Faiq, if she is saying it
with so much confidence,
[1715.54] there must be something that she felt.
[1717.79] Mother, it's nothing like that.
And you know Sania very well.
[1723.56] Anyway, you aren't that naive.
[1726.80] Look, whatever you want to say, if
you'll say it clearly it would be better.
[1732.10] Your son is having an affair with a
girl and you aren't even aware of that?
[1736.28] Salman there's this thing, 
people are right, life isn't easy.
[1741.16] Stop it, man. You have been
talking philosophy since so long.
[1746.32] Life isn't that difficult.
[1748.29] We are much better than many
others. You should be thankful.
[1752.98] You are right.
[1754.67] And I have just one suggestion for you now.
[1757.74] That do whatever you feel happy about.
[1762.81] -Are you happy?
-Me?
[1767.53] Where did my happiness come in this?
