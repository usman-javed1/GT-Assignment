From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you By the way, there are so many people
in the house who can poison his ears. You do get what I'm saying, don't you? What can I answer you about this?  Okay, just keep you stance on this matter. Because if I get to know that
you are the one misleading him, you're going to see then
what I am going to do, got it? Where there is happiness coming to
this house, there is a little sadness too. There is confusion and worries. Regarding what, Dad? Let me tell you. I want that
you both clear it yourselves that you love each other
and want to marry each other. It was my wish that if any one of them
showed interest for the other then I would have talked to them.
They would have never let me down. I wish they liked each other then... only if... Brother, you did whatever you could do. If this relationship couldn't happen then there must be some wisdom of God in it. You are right. Brother, I would say regarding this relationship
I had my doubts too. I didn't feel like telling you about it. Look, Zaid is going to start his new life, he needs your support
and love a lot at his time. Zaid is going to stay very happy
with Zoya, with God's will. And then the girl is from our family, if not yours he chose sister's niece. It doesn't make any difference. Just forget the past and accept Zoya your daughter in law. All right. I am less burdened to know that you weren't satisfied with
that relationship either. And Aima didn't want this
to happen as well. At times one has to let go of one's wishes and accept the reality. I just pray to God that may he make
the children's decision best for them. Brother, you go and get fresh. I'll get you a nice cup of tea then. -Come on.
-I'm sorry, okay. -I don't understand one thing yet.
-What is it? The excitement you had regarding Zaid's
marriage, where did it vanish suddenly? What do you mean? Where can it
go? And who told you that it is vanished. Your behaviour. You don't even ask a single thing
 if I went there, what happened, how did it go? If I didn't ask you can tell,
what did you decide? We have thought that both the families
would sit together and decide for a date. Right after children's exams are over.
What do you think? You can see for yourself.
Do as you feel right. I have done what I thought was right. I went there with some sweet and
I've given Zoya some gift money too. Well that's enough then,
why do you need to go there again? What are you talking about, Azmat? I just went at Amber's
being her sister for now. Now we'll go with the proposal properly. You are Zaid's father,
at least take some responsibility. There are certain ways to do some things. There are protocols to follow.
Some etiquette. Please. You can say that softly too. You
asked for my opinion and I gave mine. Why do you need to get irritated over that? I'm not getting irritated, Azmat.
Have you seen your temper? -What's wrong with my temper, tell me?
-Ask yourself that, what is going on. As soon as things are progressing you are
getting frustrated by this relationship. What are you talking about? Why wouldn't
I like that my son is getting married? Well, you should, but somebody
must have said something to you. Now who would want to stop his wedding?
What nonsense are you talking about? Your sister. Who else is there
in this home to poison your ears? Where did my sister come in between
all this? Are you out of your mind? You must know about it, I'm just
getting an idea because of your attitude. Did Shabana say something else to you? Look, get rid of any suspicion
that you have for Shabana in your mind. Neither she has said anything like that,
nor she is interested in your son. Oh, so you have had a
discussion over this topic with her or else, how would have you known that
she isn't interested in Zaid any more? Stop talking nonsense. She told me once when it came up. Such things
just don't come up just like that. I was wondering what discussion
you both have in private for hours? Will you just stop now? Don't prolong this. Just let me know when you
have to take proposal to Amber's. I have told you. As soon
as I get a date from Amber  then' Ill let you know. We'll coordinate. -I have a lot of complains with you.
-Everything okay? You consider Zaid as your son, so aren't
you happy that his marriage is fixed? How can this be, sister. Who told you that? If it's not that then you should have
come to me, we live in the same house. It's our duty to share
our sorrows and happiness. When you brought the sweets,
I congratulated you then. And was that enough? You could have called Amber at least. Oh, yeah. Actually I didn't think of that.
I'm going to call her. Do I have to remind you
about everything. One should think of
somethings themselves too. As I said, I just didn't think  of it.
If you say I will call her right now. Yeah, if you feel like. I just thought to spend
some time with you today. That so nice of you, sister. Don't you ever think that I am not
happy about Zaid and Zoya's marriage. Believe me, I felt really happy
as soon as I heard this news. I pray that both of them stay blessed and may they have
all the happiness in this world. Amen. May your prayer gets accepted. I want you to get serious
about Aima's marriage too. Look all the girls and boys
of her age are getting married. And it's my wish that her marriage
gets fixed along with Zaid and Zoya. Zoya comes here after
getting married, and Aima goes to her own
home after getting married too. Yes, sister. You have been avoiding me for the
whole year saying yes, sister, yes, sister. Actually, sister, I haven't gotten
any appropriate proposal for her yet. And the proposals she was getting,
brother didn't like them. Oh, leave your brother, forget him. He never likes anyone. Anyway if you say
should I recommend someone? Yeah, sure. My distant relatives, they are
looking for a girl for their son. They asked about Nosheen, first but their son is a little old for Nosheen. So I thought I should ask you. After all Aima belongs to our house too. Okay, sister. I'll talk to brother
so that we can call them over. Okay, please be serious this time
and talk to Azmat. Yeah, sure, I'll talk to brother soon. Okay, get some clothes made
for yourself and ask Aima too. We'll go to Amber's house to fix a date. Yeah, okay. Dad, I've made the reports. You are here and I don't even know.
Nobody informed me. Yeah, actually you were
busy in meetings since morning, so I didn't
want to disturb you. My doors are always open for you.
You can come whenever you want. Show me. I'm really impressed. Excellent, seems like
some experienced employ has written it. I have written it
under Sir Yousuf's supervision. Still, you've
written it very well. You have gotten a masters degree,
it's not an ordinary thing. Dad, it's just been two days
since I have completed my masters. And we'll get to know
when I'll get my result. Look, as far as the result is considered,
I can say it with my eyes closed that as usual you are going
to get a good position. Let me tell you what is
the best thing about you, that in these three four years,
you were never after gaining marks. Rather you have developed
professional skills in you. These marks and all
are limited to the degree only. But in professional life
your skill is what you are going to need. Thank you so much, Dad.
And I'm sure what skills are left, you are definitely going
to teach me those skills. For sure. Tell me where is Zaid? He was telling me
that he is a little busy today. Yeah, very well. His marriage just got
fixed, we won't get to see much of him now. You tell me, what did you do today? Dad, for now I'm working with the research
team under Sir Yousuf's supervision. You will learn so much
after getting trained by him. Yes, Dad, I will try my best. Aima, I wanted that in these 4-5 months you must have know how
about all the departments. It might be a little overwhelming but you'll get to learn a lot. If you say I can ask
the department heads to talk to you. Yes, Dad, I was about
to ask the same from you. You are going to way ahead. Dad, it's just because
of the confidence that you have given me. -I'll go now, I have taken so much of your time.
-Okay. Thank you. Zoya, are you happy? By the way, why did you ask this question? I am really happy that you are going to
my sister's house after getting married. But I am a little anxious too. Because I want you to prepare yourself
very well to take this responsibility. My dear, I want that you
should learn in these six months. Learn? Learn what? Run a house hold, manage your
in-laws, and then there is Zaid. You must remember that Zaid
must be your first responsibility. You have to care about him
and his happiness the most. Mom, I was thinking can't we just
move the wedding date a little further? No, dear. I think It's enough time. After the marriage is fixed,
the wedding should happen soon. Other wise the more you delay it,
the more issues arise. And once you have made
a commitment with someone it's done. Mom, I'm scared that I might
completely change in these six months. No need to change, dear. I just want you to work on your weakness. So, do you think that I have got flaws? No dear, but you often lose your temper. You try to dominate people. And one has to control
a lot after getting married. It's not like I am going to strangers'
house. It's my auntie's house. No mater if your in laws
are the aunties family, but still they are going to be your in laws. There every shortcoming
of the daughter in law is kept an eye on, everything is pin pointed. You can't do your own will all the time. -Mom, you are scaring me.
-I'm not scaring you. I am explaining you so that you
don't have any difficulty adjusting there. Mom, Nosheen is there too.
And who can adjust with her? And you know what kind of a girl she is. It's too difficult. The best thing is to ignore her. That's all right, Mom. But if she is going
to say anything stupid I won't tolerate it. She is not only your cousin,
now she is your sister-in-law. You can't respond to her on everything
in a straightforward way. But how am I going to adjust with her? That's the thing
that you need to understand. And to adjust. Not everything is ideal. If she is a problem maker
be a problem solver. What's up with you suddenly? Mom, do you remember
how much I avoided getting married? I never wanted to do these adjustment,
compromise and all of that. What did you get me into? Every girl has to face it. And the good thing about
getting married here is that you know everything about
that house, about everybody. But if you were going
somewhere else after getting married, then you would have known about the
problems there after you would have gone. You're right, no matter who you marry,
in the end you have to face all this. I just don't understand
how am I going to sacrifice. I'm not like Aima. No dear, I do not want you
to be the scapegoat at all. But I just want you to learn where you have to roar like a lion
and where you have to mumble like a goat. Yo, you've got six months. Prepare
yourself properly and Zaid as well. Mom, how should I prepare Zaid? -By having a discussion.
-Discussion about what? Your emotions, insecurities, feelings. Discuss all these things with him. All of this is really important
before getting married. You'll see how much all these things
are going to be beneficial for you. I think you're right, Mom.
I should to talk to him. -Brother, I'll come later.
-No, no. Sit, sit. What is it? -I wanted to say something to you.
-Yeah, go ahead. Maybe you remember Aima's paternal auntie sent 
a proposal for Aima few days ago. So, she called me again. She is very willing for Aima. Oh, yes, she has asked it 
for the second time, hasn't she? Yes, brother. I wasn't serious about it earlier, because of a few reasons. Yeah, I have an idea. You didn't answer them because of me. Oh, no, brother. 
Please don't think that way. I had a few doubts. Actually, they used to live in Norway. I didn't want to send Aima 
so far away, across seas. Sister Nimra , is Aima's paternal aunt, but still I don't want Aima 
to go so far away. You know it how it would be possible 
for me to live without her. That's nice, other wise you know how people
blindly agree for proposals from abroad. Yes, brother. You know very well that I can't be apart from Aima. I can understand. Anyway, complete what you were saying. Actually, sister Nimra was telling me that
they have permanently moved to Pakistan. And Faiq has started 
his own business as well. -Faiq? Nimra's...
-Yeah. He is sister Nimra's eldest son 
whose proposal she has given for Aima. Younger son has moved to Canada long ago. Oh, okay. So, I just wanted them to invite them over. He is one of our own children, and then children can meet each other too.
It's been years since we met them. Yeah, sure, why not? That would be great. Oh, and, sister told me 
about a proposal as well. She was praising the family a lot. Whose proposal? She didn't give me any details but she way saying they are her relatives
and have proposed Aima. Oh, okay, I understand 
who she is talking about. She mentioned it to me. 
No, no, please say no to Almas. -Any specific reason, brother?
-I know those people. That proposal isn't appropriate. And besides, when her paternal aunt is
willing, it's better that you talk to her. Yes, brother, you are right. Set a time with her. Everything
is going to be fine, with God's will.  He will do better for us. Okay, brother. -Shabana.
-Yes? Look, you don't have to worry about
anything. Aima is my responsibility. I will do good for her 
as much as I can. That's a promise. And I know very well 
how to fulfill my promise. Brother, you didn't need 
to tell that to me. With a brother like
you, why would I worry? Bless you. Thank you. Aima, how did your day at work go? Mother, first day at work went great. It felt like I have learnt 
so much in just a day. But I have a little headache too. Let me massage your
head with some oil. You'll see your headache
is going to vanish. I need it badly. Aima, your paternal aunt called. She was asking about you once again. -Really?
-Yes. She wants to visit us. Whenever she calls 
she asks a lot about you. She wanted it since long. 
She likes you a lot. You tell me, what do you think about it? Well, you can do whatever you 
and dad think is better. That's all right, but your 
consent is important too. I want that you meet Faiq once. It's been eight to ten years 
since you guys have met. So just meet him. If you like him, then if God wills 
your marriage can be fixed. Okay? -Mother.
-Yeah? Please say yes to auntie on my behalf. I hope you didn't have any trouble
finding the house after so many days. Not at all, brother Azmat. Zaid guided us so well that we
stopped right in front of your house. Faiq so do you like it here? Uncle, why won't I? It's my own country. In fact I had to force myself to
like it there after leaving from here. That's really nice, son. Now, you tell me, where
can we have such a country We have all the four seasons here. 
Our own people, own culture. There are just some flaws 
that I will try to rectify by living here. Wow, it's highly unlikely that we see
our children these days don't forget our culture and
traditions when they go abroad. Brother Azmat, no doubt
my children used to live there but their hearts were in Pakistan. Sometimes they missed flying kites and sometimes the
hustle-bustle  on Eid ul Azha. To tell you the truth, one values
his country when one moves out. One misses it on every festive occasion. I felt like flying and coming back here. as soon as Faiq told me that he
want to set his business in Pakistan, I told him, I'll stay with you. So, Faiq, what business 
are you planning to start? Actually, uncle, I have a couple of plans. I'm researching what kind of products 
can be imported from Norway. And what kind of products are here
which can be exported to Norway. And secondly I'm interested in
opening  a restaurant. And I want to introduce 
some new dishes here. Let's see. Your idea is great, and I think 
there is a lot of potential in it. Brother Azmat, 
where is my dear and Shabana? I can't wait anymore. I've been waiting 
for so long, please call them. They must be busy in the kitchen. 
They'll be here any moment. And where is sister? I didn't
see her either. Is she all right? She has gone out for some work. 
She'll be back soon. Zaid, can you please call you mom 
and check where she is? Okay, sure, I'll just call her. No, dear, don't disturb
her, I asked just like that. I thought if she is here I could meet her. Greetings, auntie. Greetings. Wow, Aima, you have become so pretty. We didn't even realize how time passed. Look, Faiq, Aima has changed so much. Yeah, you're right, Mom. I think auntie has got her 
exchanged with someone. Remember how she was in her childhood?
Roaming around with two braids on her head. Don't you dare tease my daughter. Greetings, brother Faiq. Aima, don't call him brother at least . Oh, come on, Mom, it's okay. And you. don't tease her too. It's been
eight years when she used to have two braids. She was beautiful then 
and she is very pretty now too. So, Aima, what are you doing these days? Auntie, I've graduated. And now I'm under training in dad's office. Great, but you still seem 
to be a student of 11th standard. No one could believe 
that you are a graduate. Not just a graduate but she is 
a position holder of her university. And these days she is gracing 
my office with her presence too. Oh, wow, that's impressive, that not
only you completed your graduation but you are working too 
along with that. Good. Thank you. Children if you want 
you can show Faiq around. Yeah sure, go and take
a look around with Aima. Sure, let's go. Please come. Zaid, at least pick up your phone. Hello, what kind of a person are you? If you aren't picking up my call, 
at least you can message me. Sorry, Zoya, I had told you. What did you tell me? That Aima's auntie 
and her son are coming to meet her. You mean for marriage? No, as in they wanted 
a maid for their house, for that. I mean, it's not right 
to joke about everything, Zaid. And I didn't know about it, 
that's why I was asking. -I got to know about it for the first time.
-Seriously? Didn't I tell you? No, nobody told me. Not even you. -And you know how forgetful you are.
-Okay, I'm sorry. Anyway, forget it. Tell me how is the guy? Honestly, not bad. I mean, 
to tell you the truth, very good option. Okay, that's nice. Yeah, I mean he is well settled 
and mature, confident and handsome. If not anyone else, 
I'm already impressed by him. Wow, that's great. And the best part is
that he's quite liberal. So Aima won't face those 
typical local husband issues. And what about Aima? Is she happy? Well, she seemed happy. 
She was getting shy too. I'm so happy for her. I want to
meet her as soon as possible. No, no, don't talk about this right now. Why? You know until I play a prank
with her I can't be at ease. Zaid, what are you talking about? Well, when she is going
to ask me after the meeting  what's my honest opinion about the guy I will tell her that I don't like him at
all and she should not marry him. It's going to be a big mistake. Zaid, you know how
sensitive Aima is. So don't do it. If she is emotional 
so should I stop pranking her? Well, okay, but be careful, you are aware
how emotional she is. She starts crying. I know it. Okay, tell me what's his name? That gentleman is called Faiq. Faiq? Nice name. Right now they are having 
a conversation in private. What? Hoe has Aima become so confident? Wow. No, dad asked me to accompany them but I used the opportunity and left
Aima alone with his special someone. But you know, by seeing them together, 
I started missing my special someone too. Stop being so dramatic. You are such a drama queen. Okay, forget it, tell me will they agree? They had requested long time ago,
now it's just us who have to say yes. Which honestly I think we'll agree now. Well would be nice. By the way it would be so nice if all
three of us will get married together. I'll ask auntie to keep the dates 
close to each other. Yeah, for sure, you should. Okay, I'll hang up now. All right? Okay, bye. So, after that mama asked
me to go back and I came back. Why aren't you drinking you coffee? Actually I'm used to having
black coffee since the beginning. So, why didn't you tell me that? -I'll just get some black coffee for you...
-Oh, no. It's okay Aima, please stay. Besides, I don't want 
to waste such a good time. By the way, Aima, you know 
what we are here for? Yes. Mother, told me. That's nice. Aima, I have no objection 
on my mother's choice. I know whatever she has
chosen for me must be the best. But I want that we both know
each other a bit before that. What do you think? Yes, I don't have any problem with that. -Okay, then tell me.
-What? Anything about yourself. What should I tell you about myself? What you know about yourself. I'm Nosheen, and this is my house. I'm really sorry, I thought
my auntie lives here. She lives with us. Didn't you see how that lady 
was praising her niece? I mean, okay everybody has some qualities. But why did she need to praise her so much? I don't know, I'll change. 
I wish I could go somewhere. Well, if you want you can join us. What happened? Where is she? With Faiq and Aima.
