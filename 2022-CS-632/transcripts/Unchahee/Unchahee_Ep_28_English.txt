From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you Have you asked your sister in law
what she wants for dowry? Sister, I don't find it
appropriate asking her this. Look, I'm just saying that in your favor. This way you'll know if they want any dowry
or not. And if they do what do they want? Why did you take Nosheen along? This
was supposed to be your special moment. And you involved Nosheen in it? You're so stupid. I'm busy right now. -What do you think?
-What the hell? That if we don't remind you that
doesn't mean that we all have forgotten. Are you going to do whatever you want? Have you forgotten what you have done? Who the hell are you to forgive me? So, you handle your dad's business? Yeah, actually I've joined recently. Not only me, Aima has
joined with me as well. -I think uncle has a garments business.
-Yes, garments. Import and export to be precise. We export consignments from here, dad's partner in the US
receives it and deals further. -Good.
-You tell me, how is your business going? Yeah, going good, but it's moving slow. But if I say that it's going in the
right direction it won't be wrong. You know what? I saw your plan,
and I'm telling you it will work. Thank you. By the way, I've hears that you're
really good friends with Aima. Actually, me Aima and Zoya
are friends since childhood. School, college, university,
we were together in all of them. And see, now we're
all getting married together as well. Impressive, that's
what's called friendship. To tell you the truth, aunties says that
we heard about two bodies and one soul, but I am hearing three bodies
and one soul for the first time. By the way, there is another rumor about
you that you are marrying your cousin. I have to agree, you informant
has filled you in with correct information. You guys have met just once
and Aima has told you everything? Do you guys even talk about yourselves or
am I always the hot topic between you two. Oh, my would be wife is really
a miser when it comes to talking. That's why we have talked
about you only with her. That's all right, but you guys should
know each other before getting married. Yes, you're right. One should know
each other before getting married. But we don't talk that much. If she isn't talking,
why don't you initiate? I'm telling you she's a great listener. You should develop some
understanding with her, I'm telling you. I don't think there is going to be
an issue with the understanding. Because Aima is my cousin. That's what you think.
Zoya is my cousin too. But childhood friendship
and things on one side, the friendship, and meetings
post engagement on the other side. -Really?
-Oh, yes. Actually after being in a relationship the girl and the boy change a bit. Which is beautiful, I'm telling you. You get a feeling that you
have someone in your life who likes you who misses you in their little joys and sorrows, and
at times miss you without any reason. That's why I'm telling you, you should
get to know the other side of Aima. Wow, I'm impressed.
You talk quite sensibly. Aima has made a great friend. To tell you the truth, Faiq, I'm grateful that Aima is friends with me. Whatever qualities I have
are because of Aima. By the way, Zaid, may I ask something? Look, I'm asking you this because you
know Aima very well, you're close to her. Can she become a good life partner? Look, Faiq, there is a lot that I can say but I'll say one thing only, -You're a very lucky man.
-Really? Aima is the best girl, in every aspect. She is the best daughter, best friend, actually it won't be wrong if I say
that she is the best human being. And I have no doubts that she is
going to prove herself as the best wife. Mom tells me that too,
that she is perfect for me. Well, then Mr. Faiq I expect that
you'll become Mr. perfect as well and give this relationship its full rights. Let's see, I'll try my best. -Come, let's go inside.
-Yeah, let's go. What kind of things
were you saying at their place? What do you mean? What kind of things? You are not supposed to ask such
personal questions from somebody. You didn't need to ask about
the age, who will marry when.  All these are their personal matters. Come on, Azmat, I can't sit like a dumb person
when I'm visiting someone. When we visit someone we can't stay quiet. Actually, Shabana should
have started some conversation. My sister doesn't have the habit
to talk uselessly, okay? Wow, now if I have said something
out of courtesy you don't even like that. I am not a fool. I have a good idea why you and your daughter were
displaying so much courtesy. Can't the girl's family
even hint the boy's family? You weren't hinting, in fact you were
announcing  your daughter's qualities. And those qualities
which haven't even touched her. So what? Everyone lies at least this much. Look, my intentions were good. That our daughter gets married. They are such a nice family,
settled people. And every mother wants
that her daughter gets such in laws. Wanting and forcing
are two different things. And tell your daughter too, she was
trying to get noticed too much by Nimra. Tell her to talk less. Azmat, Nosheen is confident,
what's wrong with that? I think you are forgetting that your daughter ran away from
home on the basis of her confidence. I don't get one thing that why do you taunt and tease me
by calling her just my daughter? I didn't bring her from my mother's. She is as much your daughter
as much she is mine. So, when did I deny that? But I have no role in her up
bringing and her character. She is your responsibility. If you want to say any other
bitter thing then please go ahead  or else you might regret, Azmat I didn't mean to fight with you,
just to advise you. I only want to say that you should
avoid to say anything in front of them which can effect Aima's relationship. Azmat I just wanted that Nosheen's marriage
is fixed with her younger son. You've put it in her ears, that's enough. If she is interested
she will express it herself. And for God's sake don't say all
those stupid things again in front of her. She has seen the world,
she knows how to recognize tones. What do you think, did Shabana got Aima's
marriage fixed there by praising her so much? Yeah, she is her relative too. You are Shabana's relative too,
you never thought about them this way. The point is that people
don't look at the relationships. She has seen a lot more in Aima
that you aren't able to see. She's a very wise woman. Anyway, listen, people ask Nosheen
about her education. She gets so embarrassed. People don't even talk properly with
uneducated people let alone get married to. Please, Azmat, let her complete
her education. Let her continue it. Okay, go to her college tomorrow
and get her admitted. -Faiq, let me do it.
-I'm telling you... Aima... I needed to iron my shirt, so, Nosheen... Yeah, I said that I'm going to iron it. Auntie sent me to do it. What's wrong? I scared you a little
and you got scared so much? -Why are you here?
-Isn't this understood? I'm here to tease you, why else? I have talked a lot
with your special someone. What's wrong? Why are you sad? No, I'm not sad. Really but it's shouting out loud
that you're sad. -What?
-Your face, what else? Zaid, it's nothing like that. -Can I ask you something?
-Sure. Why do I have a feeling
that you aren't how you show yourself? What do you mean? I mean, there are a lot of things that
you hide from everyone, even from me. There are a few things
that you have kept inside you. And these things become
the reason of your distress, am I right? Am I wrong? Tell me
what is it that is bothering you? Do you think that Faiq is interested in me? What kind of a question is this? You wanted to know, didn't you?
Then answer me. Of course he's interested in you. Okay, but how can you say that? Because Faiq has told me himself that
he likes you and wants to know you more. He is really excited
about this relationship. What's wrong, Aima?
Why are you so uncertain about Faiq? Tell me, share with me everything today. Zaid, I have a feeling that auntie is forcing Faiq
to get married to me, he doesn't like me. -But why do you feel that way?
-Because... because nobody likes me, Zaid. Who told you that? I just feel that way. I'm not that type of a girl
which is liked by anyone. -Are you mad?
-I'm serious, Zaid. I'm not that type of girls which guys like. Okay, and what kind of girls do guys like?
Would you like to bother telling me that? Whatever kind they like,
they aren't like me at least. Aima, you are absolutely wrong, in fact
you are a girl which every guy would like. Would want to make you his life partner. If that's the case,
why didn't you like me, Zaid? -I, I just...
-I didn't mean to say that. I meant that guys like vivid and lively girls
who are very expressive. I've got a simple nature. Let me tell you one thing, Aima, every other girl is vivid,
talkative and expressive. But there are very less girls
who are like you. I mean, have you ever looked at yourself? You're so intelligent,
educated, well behaved. And forget all that, the most important
thing is that you are a caring person. How can anybody not like a girl like you? A girl, who understands the feelings
and emotions of the other. Doesn't leave him in bad times. Anybody can pretend to be vivid. One can deceive other. But being caring
is part of someone's nature. And your nature is like that. So please, stop pitying
and feeling sorry for yourself and go talk to Faiq. He likes you a lot, if you won't talk
to him how will you know? Even I talk to him more than you. Got it? Oh, show me, what texts are you getting? Hey! Go ahead, talk to him so that you know
how special you are to him. Go ahead, reply him. I need a little privacy. Sure, you can have
all the privacy you need. Nosheen, everything all right?
You called so early in the morning? Yeah, actually I was getting bored,
so I thought of calling you. -Actually, Nosheen I...
-Can I address you casually? Right? We're friends now. No, actually I was waiting for Aima's call. So, that's why... Okay, so when shall I call you? Okay, listen, I'm a little busy these days
so I can't talk to you daily, okay? Bye. Is my son talking to his would be bride? No, Mom, Nosheen was calling. Nosheen? Brother Azmat's son? -Yes.
-But Faiq, why is she calling you. Mom, she keeps calling,
she is a bit frank in nature. She keeps joking around,
and she's a bit dumb too. She isn't dumb but a very clever girl. She is very cunning. I observed even that day at the party,
she was trying to get too frank with you. And I'll advise you to avoid her. The kind of relation you both have,
her frankness with you isn't good. Do you get what I'm saying? Yes, Mom, I get you, don't worry.
And I'm not a small kid. You are still a kid to me. Faiq, I'm really worried about Aima. Why, Mom? What's wrong with her? No, nothing happened as such,
but she seemed really low that day. It seemed as if she is unhappy. -Really?
-Did you notice it too? I don't know, Mom. I didn't have
much interaction with her that day. Faiq, tell me clearly. Did anything happen
between you guys that day? No, Mom, nothing as such happened. She doesn't seem happy to me at all. And to tell you the truth,
you don't seem satisfied as well. I think you both need to sit together,
you need to know each other. Mom, I think she won't be
much comfortable in meeting me alone. She wasn't talking to me at the dinner too. Well, okay then, ask her how will
she feel comfortable in talking?? If you say may I call her home? Yeah, that would be rally nice. You both can spend time with each other
easily and talk to each other too. Okay, Mom, I'll talk to her about it. Faiq, look dear, whatever doubts
a girl has before getting married only her would be husband can remove it. And it's your responsibility
to remove all her doubts. Mom, don't worry
everything is going to be fine. -With God's will.
-Come, let's go. Hello, yeah this is Zoya. okay, I'll reach in an hour and then
we can discuss it with each other. Okay? Thank you, bye. Whose call was it, Zoya? Mom, I'm going to Dubai for a shoot. Dubai? How are you going
to Dubai all of a sudden? Mom, do you remember I went for
an audition a couple of months back? So they have liked my portfolio a lot. So I just got a call from them. And it's a multi-national company, 
and I've got a lead role in it. So, I'm going to Dubai. I have to go sign 
the contract with the client. Can you please ask the driver 
to get the car ready? Okay, I'll tell him to. Zoya, may I say something? Yeah, I'm ready to listen 
to anything you say right now. You should tell Zaid 
about it before leaving. Mom, I have a lot of things to do
right now. I'll tell him when it's time. No, you should discuss it with him 
before signing the contract. Mom, until things are finalized, 
I don't want to tell anything to anybody. But, Zoya, he will mind 
if you won't discuss it with him. Why would he mind? Besides this is
my personal and professional decision. And I don't want his opinion in it. Why don't you try to understand 
that you aren't single anymore. So what? Well, so you can't take such 
a big step without asking him. Mom, please don't say these
typical things to me, all right? Besides, I agreed to marry Zaid 
because he is aware of my nature. I know, dear. But you have to adjust a lot of things, you have to do a lot of
things against your nature. Mom, can we end 
this topic right here, please? Besides, my privacy 
and independence is on priority for me. And it would be better 
that you do the same. Get ready, Don't tell me, have I got a proposal 
from some rich family again? There is a thing called modesty
and manners. It's nothing like that. What do I have to prepare for then? Your dad has given permission
to send you again to college. Really? Thank God, dad got back to his senses. How rude? Aren't you ashamed? 
You say whatever you feel like. He is your dad. Yes so? I'm saying the truth. Besides,
one shouldn't keep things in their hearts. Listen to me carefully, nobody marries 
a rude girl. Specially people from good families. Nothing as such happens, 
it all depends on fate. Just look at Aima, 
what an item she has got. Well, that's true, but one 
can write his own fate too. Do you know that Nimra 
has a younger son too? So, are you also thinking about it
that auntie Nimra might choose me... Yeah, I've been thinking about it 
since the day they came to our place. Mama, you're so clever too. But Nosheen, correct yourself.
She won't even pay any heed to you if you don't correct you habits. So do you want me to change
right now in the hope that one day auntie Nimra is going to send a proposal 
for me for her son in Canada. Yeah, why not? She likes girls like Aima. Naive, simple and skillful kind. Oh, what's going on, since when 
have you started praising her? Nosheen, what's true is true. Wherever this
girl goes, everyone starts praising her. So do you want me to become Aima? Yeah, make her your target. If you are able to do that, then it
would be easier for me to trap Nimra. What's wrong? You used to say I'm going 
to prove this and prove that. I can do a lot of things, 
just let my time come. Yeah, Shabana, please come, sit. Yes, brother, you called me? I've called you because you still haven't
given me the list of stuff for dowry. I forgot to tell you, sister Nimra called. She was saying that
 she didn't like it at all. -Didn't like what?
-Te thing about dowry. I didn't get it. Actually she wants us to just marry
Aima. She said she doesn't need any dowry. And we will take care 
of everything that Aima needs. That's their greatness, 
but we can't send Aima empty-handed. God has made us able to do that. Aima has got some wishes too. We're going to make proper arrangements. Yes, brother, I'm thinking the same. Just don't worry 
and do the preparations, okay? -But brother, sister Nimra...
-I'll explain her myself over the phone. It's her goodness,
she is talking so nicely. People with large-heartedness 
are like that. But just think for yourself, if a
person has to go even on a journey, he keeps a pair of dresses
and a few things that he needs. And this is the journey of life. Don't worry. Aima's preparations are going to be great. Okay, brother. Hello. You are smiling a lot today,
any specific reason of this happiness? -Not really.
-Tell me. It just seems like I am less burdened now. Would you like to tell 
why you feel that way? I was angry with Faiq, over a small thing. I liked it that he tried to appease me. And there are no more
misunderstandings between us. Congratulations, this means the relationship
between you two has officially started. It was official earlier as well. No relationship doesn't mean 
to be engaged only. It's a very difficult relation. Not everything is
good in it all the time. You know, you get
misunderstanding and problems in it. You can say that at times of
peace being happy together and at times of distress
finding a solution together  is the sign of a good relationship. It's difficult, but if you have the support
of the other person then it's doable. But I'm glad that you guys have started 
to understand each other. You tell me, did you and Zoya 
have your understanding yet? We always had our understanding. You know, at times I feel I'm very lucky. And what's the reason behind it? She's just too chill. I mean there never comes a point between
us where there is a misunderstanding. She's the best. I'm happy for you both. And I'm happy for you both. So tell me did Faiq send any gift? The way you're smiling, 
I think there is something fishy. Come, come dear, sit down. What brought you here today? I was just passing by so
thought of meeting Zoya. Meet your auntie too sometimes. I don't see Zoya, -She has gone somewhere. She had got a call.
-Everything okay? Oh, I think she had applies somewhere. Yeah, related to modeling. She was in a hurry so she 
didn't tell any details to me. That's rude that she didn't tell you. No, she was calling you. 
She called you many times. I think there was an issue 
with the signal so it didn't connect. Any idea when she will be back? In a while, just stay, wait 
for her, she'll be back soon. By the way, it's good 
that you have come today. I had to talk to you 
about something important. Yeah, sure, please go ahead. Can you please take out time 
and visit my office some day? I wanted you to meet the lawyer. Regarding what? You know well that after me, 
all of this is Zoya's. And that girl just doesn't get serious, 
neither she has got any knowledge. Okay, but why are you telling me all this? Zaid you are my son. And you've got knowledge, you are mature. 
You understand everything. I just wanted you to visit my office
so that you can meet my lawyer  and he can explain you the details. Okay, I'll visit. Tell me, when are you coming 
to the designer with me? Yeah, I had thought about it 
but honestly I didn't get time. Let's go this weekend, there's just 
a month left in the wedding. Okay, sure, let's finalize it this weekend. So, tell me, what preparations 
are going on at your home? Wedding preparations 
are going on in full swing. Very good. Okay let me get something
for you, just wait. I'll be right back. Sure. -Hello, how are you doing?
-I'm good, how are you? I'm good too, in fact 
mom says that I'm too good. -Why? Ain't I good?
-You are good, anyway, tell me what's up? Nothing much, was just getting bored. Really? And I thought 
that you must be missing me. Oh, that's understood. 
I miss you all the time. You tell me, why did call me? -Just like that.
-Tell me, why did you call me, how did you call me? With my phone. Means you feel like joking, right? Aima, don't hide your feelings. Tell me honestly, were you missing me? Yeah, I was missing you. I really like how you called me like this. Thank you. Do call me when you can. Okay tell me, what do you want 
for your wedding night gift? How can I tell that, Faiq? 
You can give whatever you like. No, I want to give you what you like. I'll have to think about that then. Well, then think about it, 
what's the problem in it? Fine. Oh, sorry, I know that
you don't like these papers and files lying
around in the bedroom. But as the study was being cleaned,
so I thought of sitting here and work. What file is it? I was about to tell you. 
There's nothing to hide from you. You know how much I love Aima. I have always treated her 
like my own child. Now that she is going away from this
house, it's my right on her that I send her  as I planned to send my own daughter. But it couldn't happen 
with Nosheen as I planned. Anyway, forget that. I have booked an apartment for Aima. And I've opened a bank
account for her personal use. So, these are all the documents for those. We are not going to be 
with them all their lives. What happened? You didn't like it? You are telling us to exclude from the
house and you think I'm going to like it? What are you talking about? Mr. Azmat tell me, are you 
saying all that in your senses? What is it that I said that you 
are taunting me about my senses? You are telling me that you are going to
spend all your money on this mother daughter. When did I say that? I'm giving Aima 
what I planned to give Nosheen. Just stop it. Till when are you going 
to use Nosheen as an excuse? Oh, hello! What a surprise! Where have you been, Zoya? 
I've been waiting for you for so long. Nosheen, what are you doing here? Faiq I wanted to talk to you about something
important that's why I had to come. Try to resolve your own problems. I don't know what is going to happen
to you both when I'll move to my in laws. We'll wait for you to visit so that
we can place our case in your court. You have made your dresses for your
brother's wedding with so much difficulty. Why haven't you made 
any dresses for Aima's wedding? Let's see if this wedding 
takes place or not.
