[0.06] From flowers and from buds
[4.68] I have learnt to bloom and be fragrant
[9.29] When I saw you
[14.16] I learnt how to chirp from you
[19.35] I love you, Aima.
[22.56] You cheap man, if you
contact me ever again,
[26.21] then I swear I am going
to involve the police, understood?
[29.19] When I told you not to discuss it,
why did you do it then?
[33.02] -Discuss what?
-The one with Auntie and Nosheen.
[45.34] What happened?
[48.08] Dad, are you okay?
[50.64] Dad... Dad? Aima, get some water.
[53.94] -I think, are you getting a heart attack?
-Dad?
[71.48] -What's going on, Nosheen?
-What, Mama?
[75.58] There is something going on
that only you know,
[77.42] or else you won't have been
sitting here so peacefully.
[82.18] There can be something or nothing.
[84.40] Don't make me guess riddles, Nosheen,
tell me honestly.
[88.52] Mama, Why don't you trust me?
It's a good news.
[92.19] If it's such a good news,
then why don't you tell me?
[94.34] As it is your father isn't talking at all.
[97.97] You fool, tell me what is it?
[100.97] Mom, I think you are forgetting, ours
and dad's happiness is not the same.
[106.74] Till when will you keep me guessing,
just tell me, Nosheen.
[109.84] Mom, the fruit of patience is sweet.
[112.75] Let the fruit ripen properly, we'll eat
it after that slowly and enjoy it.
[119.53] Now, if you are going to eat an unripe
fruit, then it's sourness would taste bad.
[123.66] Don't try to become my mother.
Are you telling me or should I smack you?
[128.01] Oh, Mama, my, Mama, why
are you getting angry?
[131.94] When I'll tell you the whole story
[134.27] then instead of smacking me,
you are going to clap for me.
[137.44] Just stop praising
yourself now and tell me.
[141.23] Well, the story is
[143.71] that your sister-in-law's daughter
went to meet a boy.
[147.16] Aima?
[149.03] You know, affair,
girlfriend-boyfriend things.
[152.38] What happened then?
[154.25] What happened then was
that someone was already there,
[158.35] who took their photos.
[160.04] What are you talking about?
[161.30] And photos are as such, that the mythical
lovers Heer and Ranjha would fail too
[165.36]  in front of Aima and that boy.
[167.15] Then what?
[168.38] Well coincidently that guy
found dad's number,
[172.92] and he forwarded the photos to dad.
[178.49] And after looking at the photos,
[180.98] all the reality of her favourite
got revealed in front of him.
[185.14] How did all this happen, Nosheen?
[188.01] Just have the fruit not the basket.
[191.10] How did you play this trick, Nosheen?
[195.29] Mama, I didn't play this trick, time did.
[198.88] You know well that time
doesn't remain the same.
[201.34] It's in favour of someone at one point,
 and of the other at another.
[205.96] You didn't finish your dinner?
[209.88] Yes, I got so worried, Mother.
[214.16] And then, dad had left too,
who would have eaten without him.
[219.44] There must be some issue at work.
[222.14] Don't worry.
[224.88] Brother is a successful man.
[228.35] And there are a hundred evil eyes
after a successful man.
[231.77] But I know that brother knows
how to solve every issue.
[241.56] You are right, but...
[244.92] dad has never reacted this way.
[248.81] Dear, with time a person's nerves weaken.
[254.34] It's not the same as earlier.
[258.05] God has done better for us in the past.
[261.52] We should expect Him to do better
for us in future as well.
[265.47] Besides, I keep praying
for everyone in the house
[267.98]  that may God keep them safe.
[272.08] We should expect good from God.
[276.67] Yes mother.
[278.93] -Dad, dad how are you feeling now?
-Shabana, I have to talk to you in private.
[284.89] Aima, go away.
[287.94] Mother...
[292.57] Sure, please sit, brother.
[299.87] Everything all right?
[306.08] What do you think, why is dad so worried?
[312.34] I don't know but it's definitely
something big.
[315.39] because dad is not one of those
who get worried so easily.
[320.78] I got really scared.
[323.60] I gave dad the glass of water,
he refused to take it.
[327.79] He has never done this to me before.
[331.29] Calm down, Aima.
[333.28] He must have done it because he was tensed.
He would never do it intentionally.
[336.84] Zaid, please go and ask him what his wrong.
[340.52] What is it that he got to know
in his messages,
[344.62] which made him so worried.
[346.85] You know well that when he is worried
he doesn't talk to anyone.
[349.44] He asked mother and Nosheen
to go away from his room as well.
[356.73] But I am sure that if you go talk
to him, then he will let you know
[359.92] because he never says no to you.
[362.24] No, I don't want to go to dad right now.
[367.48] Why?
[369.71] Because... because I think
we should leave him alone right now.
[375.77] I don't want to disturb him.
[379.66] I hope it is something
related to the house.
[383.97] Because he never shares
anything related to business.
[386.37] But if it's a domestic issue
he will tell us.
[390.12] -So, is it regarding his business...
-Honestly, I have no idea.
[394.78] I don't know what message he got
that made him so worried.
[399.63] Phone... that reminds me,
where is dad's phone?
[402.87] Nosheen might have picked it up. Dad forgot
it on the dining table when he left.
[409.36] Right. Now, we can just wait
[413.82] that dad comes out of his room
and tells us what is wrong.
[440.82] Aima, all the pictures that I have
of yours are edited by me.
[447.48] All of them are fake, edited.
[450.63] Besides, I am not going
to send your pictures to anyone.
[453.45] I don't have the contact
of any of your family member.
[456.93] Delete them in front of me. Right now.
[468.50] Such a huge thing has happened
and your dad is sitting quietly in his room.
[472.79] I get really scared of his silence.
[476.03] Mom, those who are guilty should be scared.
[479.49] Just stay calm, besides the reality will be
revealed in front of everyone eventually.
[483.33] Your dad knows well how to keep a secret,
[485.27] it might be possible that
he just doesn't reveal it
[486.48]  and no one ever gets to know about it.
[487.81] I won't let that happen,
the damage is done all ready.
[490.77] When he caught you,
[492.58] he announced it everywhere that
my daughter won't continue her studies.
[497.41] This is how your dad is. It's been hours
and he hasn't uttered a word until now.
[503.04] He cares about his niece
 more than her daughter.
[506.12] Mama, I am more furious than you
on these mother and daughter.
[510.62] How can I forget, how much humiliation
I had to face because of them.
[513.93] She stabbed me in the back
in the name of friendship.
[516.36] Don't worry. I won't let Shabana
raise her head after this.
[520.97] She was so proud of her
daughter being so naive.
[525.11] You'll see how I am going
to humiliate her all the time.
[530.71] Get ready then, because dad went
to their room just now.
[536.89] He must have shown the wrong doings
of his favourite one to auntie.
[541.06] We have started this game,
[543.14] and your dad shouldn't
get out of our influence now.
[547.21] Excuse me, Mama, out of my influence.
[550.29] I was the master mind of this game,
[552.59] so everyone is going
to do what I say, including you.
[555.70] You fool, I have given birth to you.
[559.24] What's so different about that?
As if you had another choice.
[563.13] Pride must have a fall.
[565.08] Just don't do anything in your pride
[567.04] that all this game that you have
setup goes to waste. Okay, Nosheen?
[570.90] I know what I'm doing, Mom.
[574.02] I thought that he wanted something else.
[580.55] I thought he wanted you
to get married to Zaid.
[588.77] Why did I become unwanted
[593.30] Nobody knows that
[598.03] Why did I become unwanted
[602.61] Nobody knows that
[609.67] Mother...
[612.73] Has dad said anything to you?
[621.31] I don't understand,
[624.55] what's wrong with brother?
[628.81] He has never talked to me
 in this gruff tone before.
[634.23] -Has he said something about me to you?
-Yes.
[641.17] He has told me that...
[644.54] whatever proposals there are for Aima think
over them and whichever you find suitable
[651.37] get Aima married there as soon as possible.
[658.20] Before today whenever your
marriage was discussed,
[665.02] brother always told me to let
you finish your studies first.
[671.05] I thought that he was
thinking of something else.
[677.56] I thought, may be he wanted you
to get married to Zaid.
[686.80] But today, suddenly,
[692.50] brother said this to me.
[699.56] I... I don't get it.
[719.32] -Aima, Aima?
-Yes?
[724.28] Yes, yes, Mother?
[727.46] What's wrong? What are you thinking?
[731.59] Nothing.
[734.23] Then why is your face turning pale?
[743.35] Just... just like that.
[748.55] Go, have your dinner. You know
that you get sick if you stay hungry.
[754.47] I'm not hungry right now.
[757.63] I will eat when I... I'm hungry.
[765.98] Aima, dear...
[770.83] dear, tell me
[774.79] have you committed any mistake?
[795.55] What I was fearing has happened .
[802.14] He sent dad my pictures.
[808.78] Oh, God!
[812.12] What shall I do?
[819.67] How am I going to prove
in front of dad that
[825.62] I am innocent.
[830.60] How am I going to regain
my place in his eyes?
[835.41] I just don't understand.
[855.05] Hello, Aima. I have been calling you
for so long, why weren't you picking up?
[860.02] Zoya, can you please come to me?
[864.75] I need you.
[868.14] What's wrong, are you all right?
[871.07] No, Zoya. Please come to me.
[877.05] My heart is sinking being alone.
[879.74] Okay, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[895.79] Zaid, where are you, please pick my call.
[917.95] What's wrong, sister? Everything all right?
[919.96] What should I tell you? There is so
much sensational going on in the house.
[924.52] Oh, sister, please don't do anything that
bother Azmat gets angry with you again.
[930.22] We are all fine, it's our enemies
who have lost their senses.
[934.88] Why? What happened?
[937.12]  He has no reason now to get angry on us.
[942.00] Oh, why are you creating suspense?
 Just tell me.
[945.24] Well, something has happened through
which my oldest wounds have been healed.
[951.06] It's no fun telling all this
over the phone. Come to my home.
[957.17] Oh, you should have called
five minutes earlier,
[959.43] Zoya has just left for your house.
[961.51] -Zoya is coming to our house?
-Yes she is, don't you know?
[965.61] No, anyway, you too come over,
as soon as possible.
[969.89] Okay, I'll see. I will come to your place
after getting off from work tomorrow.
[973.79] -Goodbye.
-Okay, good bye.
[985.86] Aima, this can't be, it must be
some other matter.
[993.26] Zoya, al the signs are clear.
[997.80] He has sent my pictures to dad.
[1001.77] Looking at which, dad got sad.
[1005.34] And he asked mother to get me married
as soon as possible.
[1013.23] But, Aima, you said yourself that he is
some random guy, why would he do this then?
[1021.55] Yes he was.
[1027.20] I don't understand his motive
of doing all this.
[1033.25] Zoya... Zoya,
[1037.62]  What if dad won't believe me?
[1041.56] What if he proves in front of dad that
I went to meet him alone at his flat?
[1049.93] -I will lose all respect in dad's eyes.
-Aima, Aima...
[1054.38] Aima, calm down, calm down.
[1056.41] Wait a second, listen.
Listen to me, look here.
[1059.12] Listen to me. Look, don't worry,
we'll think of something, okay?
[1064.99] And, did you talk to Zaid about it?
[1070.70] Aima, are you serious?
 What were you thinking?
[1076.05] I told you to take him into confidence.
[1081.32] Now, Zaid knows nothing about it,
what if uncle asks him anything?
[1087.94] Where is Zaid right now? Talk to him.
[1091.81] I have called him many times,
couldn't get through.
[1099.94] I just don't get why this person
is doing all this?
[1105.86] Okay, listen. Listen to me
with a cool mind, okay?
[1109.44] If he wanted to blackmail you, he
would have asked for money from you, right?
[1113.95] But he just met you,
so maybe he just wanted to meet you.
[1119.62] I don't think there is any enmity.
[1124.88] Yes, it's possible that he isn't my enemy.
[1129.97] But it is possible that someone else
might be using him for their enmity.
[1137.52] -Who?
-I have no idea.
[1139.87] Zoya, I don't understand anything.
[1142.09] Okay, enough, enough.
[1147.11] Enough, enough.
[1155.85] -Dad.
-Hmm?
[1158.08] Why are you so worried?
[1164.04] I know you are always worried about me.
[1169.89]  But I am better now. I'm fine.
[1172.55] But we should know, Dad,
[1174.48] what is it which made you so sad?
[1180.25] Yes, there is an issue.
[1182.75] But some things are for elders to deal with.
[1185.84] It's better that you don't
take any interest in it.
[1190.20] Dad, what if I tell you that I know
what this matter is?
[1197.39] Do you remember, Dad? When you left your
phone on the table, I gave it back to you.
[1203.65] I have seen everything, Dad.
And I know why you are worried.
[1209.21] Dad I think this is the first time when
[1212.02] I am looking you in the eye
while talking.
[1215.94] And why is that?
[1217.72] Because the reason why I was
 humiliated and belittled,
[1221.88] and the girl whom you made my role model
[1225.77] she has done something worse than I did.
[1229.17] I told you earlier as well, wrong
remains wrong no matter who does it.
[1236.07] And these are your words too, Dad, that,
"I consider you and Aima as equal."
[1239.32] Where is that equality now?
[1241.17] Why haven't you gone to her university
yet, to get her admission cancelled?
[1245.66] Why haven't you put
any restrictions on her?
[1247.74] Why aren't you looking
for proposals for her?
[1249.87] I did go to Shabana to talk about it.
[1252.42] Where did your equality go
 in this matter, Dad?
[1255.16] You humiliated me and mama so much.
[1257.92] The whole house was echoing of your
voice when you were humiliating us.
[1262.32] And today? Today your silence
 is saying something else, Dad.
[1266.36] Quiet. Stay quiet.
[1270.75] Don't you have any manners?
[1273.37] I am your father, how are you supposed
to talk to me? Do you have an idea?
[1277.86] No, Dad, not today.
[1281.83] I know that I am ill-mannered
and I know the reason for that as well.
[1287.66] And Aima has shown you her real face.
[1290.66] She has shown you that we both
are such girls that you don't like.
[1296.03] -What do you want?
-Justice.
[1298.72] Equality, Dad. You are a man of your words.
[1302.93] Then you can't get
a better chance than this, Dad.
[1328.59] Greetings, Dad. Shall we go?
[1330.86] -Yes, let's...
-No!
[1333.39] You are going to go
to the university alone from now on.
[1336.29] Aima won't go.
[1343.53] Why did I become unwanted
[1348.12] Nobody knows that.
[1355.94] Why did I become unwanted
[1357.40] Nobody knows that.
[1371.84] Come on, hurry up, we are getting late.
[1376.48] -Greetings, Dad.
-Greetings, didn't you go yet?
[1380.10] I was just leaving, I was waiting
for Aima, and here she is.
[1385.30] -Greetings, Dad. Shall we leave?
-Yes, let's...
[1388.26] No! You are going to go alone
to the university.
[1393.02] Aima won't go.
[1415.38] Dad, can I talk to you for a while?
[1417.98] No,you can't.
[1420.73] But, Dad...
[1421.94] I told you, I am not in a mood
to talk right now, go from here.
[1430.59] It's a request, Dad.
Just listen to me for two minutes.
[1442.47] Dad, why have you stopped Aima
from going to the university?
[1447.77] I think you are not old enough
that I am answerable to you.
[1453.01] No, Dad, I didn't mean it that way.
[1455.10] It's just that, it's a
very important day.
[1457.37] It's the last date for
our report submission.
[1459.32] It's really important for us to go.
[1461.65] If it's so important then you may go.
[1465.07] -Dad, what has happened?
-I said what I had to.
[1471.30] Dad, you wanted me
to take interest in domestic issues.
[1474.37] Now that I am asking you that
what is going on at home
[1477.87]  then you aren't telling me.
[1479.88] Look, son, I want you
to take interest in domestic issues,
[1484.03] But I don't want you
to ask questions from me.
[1489.48] Secondly, I don't say anything
for no reason?
[1496.68] I think you are getting late. Go now.
[1520.84] Aima. Aima what is it? Why are you crying?
[1526.96] I don't understand what is wrong?
Why would dad do that?
[1534.85] All this drama had to be today.
[1537.81] After the due date,
[1538.74] either sir won't accept
the the assignment,
[1541.43] or he will deduct marks
because of late submission.
[1546.94] Aima, do you know why dad is stopping
you from going to the university?
[1553.95] Zaid, you just talked to dad,
what did he say?
[1558.68] He didn't give me a proper answer,
rather he scolded and sent me away.
[1561.71] He was saying,
"Don't question my decisions."
[1567.05] Aima, may be
he didn't like something that you did.
[1570.66] And may be he has stopped you from going
to the university for the time being.
[1577.96] Okay, please don't worry,
[1579.85] I will meet the teacher personally and
submit your assignment, don't worry.
[1585.10] -I am not crying because of that.
-Then what?
[1589.53] I am crying because dad is angry with me.
[1597.98] -Zaid, he has never been angry with me.
-That's true.
[1604.58] In fact he has never scolded you even.
[1607.28] Dad... dad is angry with me.
[1613.41] I... I feel like I am going
to stop breathing.
[1618.99] I just don't understand.
[1621.08] Then why don't you just go
and say sorry to him.
[1626.16] I mean, did you misbehave with him?
[1628.45] Did you deny something
what he asked you to do?
[1631.20] Did you  made auntie angry?
[1633.61] Then why would dad be angry
with you for no reason?
[1637.11] There must be some reason.
[1643.76] Are... are you aware of the reason?
[1650.99] Aima, have you committed any mistake?
[1657.03] Zaid... I...
[1660.56] I... I...
[1664.56] I have committed a huge mistake.
[1691.36] Nosheen, is this the time to sleep?
[1695.25] Mama, don't scold me.
I slept peacefully after so long.
[1700.12] Why is that?
[1701.98] Because I paid everything back last night.
[1706.00] To Aima?
[1707.66] No, I will pay her back
once I get a chance.
[1711.14] I went to dad last night.
[1713.44] What did you guys talk about?
[1716.60] -There was no talking, just rebuked.
-Your Dad?
[1722.22] No it was my turn this time.
[1726.76] By the way, what you
anticipated was right.
[1730.07] What?
[1731.52] Dad was completely in a mood
[1733.62] to hide everything what his
favourite one did and sit quietly.
[1738.62] I had an idea. I am well aware
of Azmat's nature.
[1745.84] But I have tightened the screws
in such a way
[1749.66] that  dad will be enraged
because of his honour.
[1754.16] So, that's the reason.
[1757.97] Is Aima at home today?
[1759.88] She went crying into her room. I am
sure Azmat must have stopped her.
[1764.52] Thank God, she is done with the university.
[1767.19] By the way, what do you think of me now?
[1771.25] I must admit, Nosheen.
[1773.24] No one in my previous seven generations
could have been as sharp as you are.
[1777.57] Something that I couldn't do all my life,
you did it so swiftly, Nosheen.
[1783.59] Oh, my God!
[1785.09] I would have also made these mother-daughter
duo dance on my tune as well,
[1789.05] but I was never to shut Azmat up ever.
[1792.45] Whenever I say something,
Azmat loses his temper.
[1797.02] I have made such an arrangement
that he is going to stay quiet now.
[1800.19] The game which you have played,
heads is ours and tails is ours too.
[1805.58] Now you'll see how Azmat
gets straightened like an arrow.
[1809.56] Mama, whoever messes
with us is going to bite the dust.
[1813.33] I am just waiting for what
is going to happen next?
[1816.48] Just a few people know that right now.
[1819.02] This thing is going to be a slap
on every one of his loyal people.
[1825.92] I am thinking, Mama,
that I should nab one of them today.
[1830.72] Where you have waited so long,
wait for a little longer.
[1834.62] If you'll get involved
then someone might doubt you.
[1838.39] Me? How will someone doubt me, Mama?
[1841.91] I am a naive girl,
who stays within the house.
[1846.55] I have no connection from the outside
world. I don't even have a phone.
[1853.19] Okay, now stop being a drama queen.
Just have some patience.
[1855.57] Let your father reveal what has happened.
You can do whatever you want after that.
[1859.63] or else your impatience
[1862.31] might ruin the whole game
that you have played, Nosheen.
[1869.18] You are right.
[1874.18] Aima, so much has happened and you
didn't even bother to inform me?
[1880.34] That cheap person kept torturing
you, and blackmailing you,
[1884.36] and you just kept hiding it from me?
Till when were you planning to hide it?
[1888.74] Zaid, I didn't intend to hide it from you.
[1892.98] Whatever the reason is, Aima,
[1894.32] there is just one justification for it
and that is that you don't trust me.
[1898.76] I have no importance in your life.
[1902.24] It's nothing like that, Zaid.
Please try to understand.
[1906.88] Such a huge thing happened and even
Zoya didn't let me know about it?
[1910.22] I kept asking you both
over and over again
[1912.15] to please tell me what is
the problem, share with me,
[1915.26] And every time you guys avoided answering
it by talking about something else,
[1917.71] as if I were a kid. As if you were
avoiding something a kid is asking.
[1923.41] In such situations
[1924.59] one even asks for help from a random
person, some relative or a friend even.
[1928.19] You didn't think me worthy enough
that I could give you any sort of help.
[1931.99] Ridiculous.
[1933.56] Zaid, it's not like that,
you have misunderstood.
[1938.92] I have understood everything.
[1940.77] I am just not worth it in yours and Zoya's
eyes to be trusted even a little bit.
[1946.29] Sometimes I think that I am just there
to pick and drop you guys in your lives.
[1952.45] I tell you my secrets so that you guys
can laugh on them behind my back.
[1956.11] Zaid...
[1958.93] Zaid what are you talking about?
[1960.72] You are misunderstanding us.
[1963.89] Yes, Aima, you are absolutely right.
[1965.87] I have been misunderstanding
you both before today.
[1972.52] You know what, Aima,
I thought of our friendship matchless.
[1977.49] But it all was a lie, a deception.
[1980.56] No, Zaid, we are the same as we were.
[1984.06] It's just me, I committed a mistake.
[1990.41] May be yours and Zoya's friendship is
matchless, I am not part of it anymore.
[1994.89] Zaid, please.
Please, just listen to me once.
[1998.62] No, Aima, please. It's okay, I understand.
[2000.96] If you think you can handle
all your problems yourself
[2004.27] -that's good for you then.
-Zaid, just listen to me.
[2008.98] I need you.
[2010.84] The sorrow which I have draped myself with
[2015.70] My body burns because of it
[2020.35] I have watched the flames burning
[2024.61] So I learned how to burn
[2027.54] Why did I get unwanted
[2032.22] Nobody knows that
[2036.87] Why did I get unwanted
[2041.09] Nobody knows that
[2046.21] Aima, were you crying?
[2050.65] No, I wasn't.
[2055.31] Did anybody say something to you?
Sister or Nosheen?
[2059.70] Zaid, I am not Aima,
so behave yourself, okay?
[2063.00] Then don't listen, go from here.
[2065.36] I am a savage person,
I start beating up people walking by.
[2069.43] It's not like that, Zaid.
[2071.19] Yes, I knew about your character.
[2073.17] But I can't support you here
because I was not aware of anything.
[2078.81] You called him yourself.
You went to meet him at his flat as well.
[2082.08] For all I know, you might be having
an affair with him too.
