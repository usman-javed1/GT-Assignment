[0.00] From flowers and from buds
[4.57] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.16] When I saw you
[14.30] I learned to chirp from you
[18.67] I was thinking of going to lunch
tomorrow after our presentation.
[24.36] No, I won't be coming to office tomorrow.
[27.71] Aima, is everything all right?
[30.61] I tried to talk sweetly with
your son on your advice.
[35.09] Then?
[36.34] Then what? He thinks
of himself as something.
[39.26] He is so proud.
[41.54] -Rather do one thing. You want money?
-Yeah.
[44.63] Then go and jump off a roof.
[47.66] I promise I will pay for your shroud.
You won't die like you don't have anyone.
[51.45] Just try and die once.
[53.50] Well, I am not going to die so easily.
[58.36] And if I die, I will cause
many others to die with me.
[61.83] What do you mean?
[63.03] You are wise enough to
understand what I'm saying.
[67.25] You will get fever. Wear this.
[73.96] You are just...
[76.02] Oh, I'm so sorry guys.
I didn't want to disturb you both.
[82.52] No, Zoya, it's nothing like
what you think, we were just...
[87.69] talking.
[88.92] It is like that, Zaid. Besides there
was such a nice romance going on
[93.52] and I spoiled it for no reason.
[100.65] Nosheen, one day you are going to
make us stop breathing. Tell me what it is?
[104.93] -Mama, I need some money.
-How much money?
[109.97] Around a 100,000 rupees.
[112.12] A hundred thousand?
[114.43] talk slowly someone might listen.
[117.19] Why do you want so much money, Nosheen?
[119.94] I can't tell you that.
[122.21] Oh, God. Are you involved
in something again?
[128.41] Please don't do any stupidity this time.
[130.96] Tell me are you involved in something?
[133.35] -Mama, what are you talking about?
-First tell me what is it or else I won't give any money.
[138.69] I have to give the money to Faisal.
[144.16] Oh my God, this girl 
will disgrace me again.
[147.13] Mama, get hold of yourself, 
what are you doing?
[150.18] Nosheen, are you having an
affair with him even after marriage?
[154.78] Aren't you satisfied yet even
after bearing so much loss?
[157.37] Mama, just listen, it's nothing like that.
[161.03] I don't believe anything that you say now.
[163.35] -I swear upon you, Mama.
-Don't you swear upon me falsely.
[167.69] Mama, please trust me. I can
swear upon anybody. I swear upon God.
[173.16] Tell me why do you have to pay him?
[176.08] Mama, he is blackmailing me.
[178.62] But don't worry, I know how to handle him.
[183.26] Just give me the money
so that I can give it to him.
[186.69] And give it to me before Faiq
arrives, so please give it to me quickly.
[190.22] Otherwise if Faiq arrives, 
it's going to be a problem.
[209.75] -Dad, you called me?
-Hey, you have come to office? With whom?
[216.12] I hailed a cab.
[219.39] A cab? Why? Didn't Zaid drop you?
[223.47] You could have taken the other car.
[225.55] It's okay, dad. I can come by myself. 
The office isn't that far.
[230.34] Whatever it is, I don't
like you coming in a cab.
[237.33] What is it? You seem dull today. 
Anything wrong?
[242.38] No, Dad, I'm all right.
[244.76] No, you don't seem fine.
[247.60] I have got a little fever since yesterday.
[251.70] You should have taken off then, 
why did you come?
[254.81] No, it was just a mild fever, 
but I had taken the medicine.
[259.41] But still, I'll ask Zaid to
take you to the doctor.
[263.44] No, please don't ask him
anything to do, I am okay.
[267.35] Aima, is Zaid behaving nicely with you?
[275.41] Yes, everything is fine.
[278.59] Don't you worry, I will talk to him.
[281.21] No, Dad, just leave it. Stop it.
[287.00] Till when are you going to
keep asking him to do things?
[290.62] I don't want the forced love 
and forced respect.
[297.64] All of it seems fake.
[300.26] -But I was just...
-I know, Dad, that you love me a lot.
[305.93] That's why you keep
reminding him of my rights.
[311.40] But I want to request something to you,
[314.63] please don't force him to do things.
[321.86] He is a human, after all 
he has a right to live his own life.
[328.27] He is divided in two halves.
[330.44] Because of you forcing him, he is
compelled to behave nicely with me.
[336.44] I don't have any complains from him.
[339.71] But I don't want fake love from him either.
[344.25] Please, never ever force him for it again.
[368.38] Take this and leave me alone now.
[370.64] How can I leave you like that?
[373.32] -What do you mean?
-No, I didn't mean that.
[377.97] If you think that I got scared
of you then it isn't like that at all.
[381.44] You know very well that
Nosheen isn't scared of anyone.
[383.90] I am just helping you out.
[386.49] I know.
[388.55] I have hurt you a lot.
[391.75] But I promise I will never do that again.
[394.59] Stop pretending and let me go.
[396.93] Listen, Nosheen, I really miss you.
[399.95] Faisal, have you gone mad? 
Someone might see us.
[403.69] I am really sorry.
[408.44] I have hurt you a lot, but
honestly I want to marry you.
[411.90] I want to have a home with you.
[414.39] There is no use of all this now. Just
keep this money and leave me alone.
[419.08] You'll see, now that you
have given me this money,
[422.47] I will pay off all your
debt in just a few days.
[428.04] -By the way, is this the full amount?
-I had 50,000/- only.
[437.49] I don't have any more. Besides,
I am not responsible for you.
[442.58] Nosheen, how am I going to
arrange the rest of the money?
[445.85] It's not my problem. Go work
somewhere or beg on the streets.
[449.43] I don't care.
[454.63] Okay, half the money is fine.
[458.26] My dear, you are too stupid. 
But very useful.
[463.54] Not just a hundred thousand, I will mint
hundreds of thousands of rupees from you.
[484.65] Oh God, oh my Lord, 
save my daughter from this problem.
[490.78] What sins have we committed,
oh Lord. Please forgive us.
[494.70] Save my daughter's marriage, my Lord.
[507.23] Oh, Nosheen please pick up.
[509.88] Pick up, my child.
[512.60] Don't know why she isn't picking up.
[517.97] Oh, Nosheen please pick up.
[519.97] Where are you, my child?
[523.41] Oh, Lord.
[532.39] Where are you, Nosheen. 
Pick you mother's call.
[552.55] So, tell me, how is work?
[556.20] Honestly very busy. I have come
here by skipping a meeting. What is it?
[561.50] Oh, I'm so sorry to disturb you.
[565.49] No, it's okay.
[567.44] The schedules will carry on.
You said it's something important
[569.50] so I though I should come and ask.
[573.79] Actually, I am thinking
of starting a new venture.
[579.79] And it's my own investment.
[583.55] And the issue is that I don't
have any supporting hand.
[589.23] How can I manage all this alone, you know.
[593.04] Zoya is least interested in my business.
[597.55] But I have you.
[600.22] Like my own son.
[603.67] And your business
management skill is very good too.
[612.20] So I was expecting
you to take interest in it.
[615.41] Sure that's really great, why not?
[618.25] As I said I have a really
hectic schedule right now
[621.94] but don't worry I am
definitely going to help you.
[626.51] I am not asking for your help, dear.
[634.01] I am talking about 50% partnership
in my business.
[640.23] Actually, auntie, you know it
how much dad relies on me.
[644.27] I have a key post in the office too.
[647.56] I don't think it can be possible.
[650.48] But Aima is there to handle his business.
[655.86] You are right but still...
[660.71] Just think it over it thoroughly.
[665.06] You are doing a job I your dad's business.
[669.65] And I am offering you a 50% partnership.
[676.90] And I wanted to ask
something else too from you.
[681.36] Yes, sure.
[683.13] Son, you took Zoya from
me with so much love.
[692.51] And you know very well that
Zoya's happiness matters a lot to me.
[700.14] I waited really long after
you both got married, but
[705.62] things are not moving 
in the right direction.
[708.93] Auntie, I can understand your concern but I
think Zoya needs to learn a few things too.
[716.84] I mean, we are in a committed relationship
[718.76] in which at times a
person agrees to something
[720.23] and sometimes expects
the other to agree to them.
[721.30] But this habit of hers to
be stubborn over everything
[724.68] or make everything
an issue about her ego,
[726.31] she has to quit that.
[727.54] I think
[729.99] that Zoya has a lot of
complaints from you too,
[731.87] but I am talking about
the solution to this problem.
[737.11] You love Zoya a lot too, I know that.
[742.12] Whatever happened in the
past few days after your marriage
[745.30] I don't want to discuss it here.
[751.24] But because of all that Zoya is
disturbed mentally and emotionally.
[758.39] What I am going to ask you now is
just to bring peace in lives of you both.
[772.16] Hello, Nosheen.
[773.27] Yes, Mama, why are you
calling me again and again?
[776.95] I am so worried because of you.
[779.30] Oh, telling you something
make things more difficult.
[783.15] At least tell me, was there any
problem when you went to meet him?
[787.34] There wasn't any problem at that
time, but it can be a problem now.
[789.89] -What do you mean?
-I mean my dear, Mama,
[793.97] where am I right now? At my in laws.
[796.14] And the amount of details
your are expecting from me,
[798.36] if I start telling you then
everyone would know about it.
[802.27] Okay, Nosheen, I'm hanging up,
just tell me was there any problem?
[806.91] No, I didn't have any problem.
[808.76] And don't you worry, I know very
well how to deal with guys like Faisal.
[813.45] I am going to call the police
and he will straighten up.
[816.75] No, Nosheen, for God's sake
don't do anything of this sort.
[820.90] Okay, don't worry, 
I won't do anything like that.
[824.34] You solve the
problem of your home.
[827.18] What should I handle?
I just don't understand.
[831.45] Okay now just hang up
or they might doubt you.
[835.92] -Bye.
-Bye, and listen, Nosheen,
[839.77] Yes, what is it?
[841.34] You are not going to keep any
contact with this guy, okay? No contact.
[847.07] Yes, don't you worry, bye.
[873.54] Oh God take my daughter
out from this issue.
[883.25] If you have a solution
please do let me know.
[885.53] What is it that I should
do so that she gets happy.
[887.42] But please, auntie, please don't demand
anything from me that I am unable to do.
[893.76] Like what?
[895.54] Like,
[898.15] like me leaving Aima.
[899.91] Because it's not possible.
[903.30] Fine, then there is
just one solution to it.
[908.02] -You and Zoya should move to my house.
-Excuse me?
[914.40] What are you talking about, auntie?
[916.16] You want me to leave my home and stay
at your place like a live in son in law?
[919.79] Please, Zaid, it's a positive solution.
[923.58] Don't think of it with 
a typical, middle class mentality.
[929.59] Leaving your home wouldn't mean at all
[932.53] that you are going to cut
your ties off with you family.
[938.15] It's just for change. 
And I think you need it too.
[943.04] That's not possible, 
I can't leave my parents.
[947.47] They are not alone, Zaid.
[949.70] There is sister, Shabana, his family,
Aima. There is everyone with him.
[957.97] To tell you the truth 
I am the one who is alone.
[960.94] I need you both, Zaid.
[965.28] And when a girl can leave her
home and live at the guy's house,
[970.20] why can't a guy leave his home for her?
[979.15] I can understand your concern, auntie
[981.91] but I'm sorry, anyone
who does that is considered
[984.41] really bad in the society that we live in.
[986.84] He has to listen to
other people's taunts too.
[988.62] So, if it's only about
living in the girl's house,
[992.42] then I can get you both a separate home.
[995.52] You guys can shift there.
[997.46] Auntie, it's not about affordability.
Even I can get a separate house for Zoya.
[1002.14] -But...
-Zaid,
[1004.43] this suggestion doesn't
have any ulterior motive,
[1008.32] nor it is to cut you
off with your family.
[1013.83] I just want to see you both happy.
[1017.23] And for that you have
to get out of that house.
[1021.83] Only then you guys can relax.
[1024.17] And this step is going to bring 
a lot of change in your life. Trust me.
[1028.21] -But , auntie , I think...
-Dear,
[1031.42] think over it thoroughly
and then give a response.
[1034.72] I know that this is not going to
be easy for you, it's a huge step.
[1048.05] Don't worry I am going to talk to him.
[1050.68] No, Dad, just leave it. Stop it.
[1056.47] Till when are you going to
keep asking him to do things?
[1058.09] I don't want this forced love 
and forced respect.
[1074.57] Then there is just one solution to it.
[1077.50] -You and Zoya should move to my house.
-Excuse me?
[1082.18] What are you talking about, auntie?
[1083.91] You want me to leave my home and stay
at your place like a live in son in law?
[1087.56] Please, Zaid, it's a positive solution.
[1091.38] Don't think of it with 
a typical, middle class mentality.
[1112.14] Why are you crying, I took
the glass out. Does it still hurt?
[1116.63] -No.
-Then why are you crying?
[1119.38] Zaid,
[1123.19] can I ask something from you?
[1126.22] Sure, go ahead.
[1129.90] Your indifference hurts me a lot.
[1144.79] Zoya, for God's sake.
[1147.70] Instead of understanding my problem
you are threatening me on everything.
[1151.63] I'm not threatening you, Zaid,
I'm just expressing my intention.
[1189.70] My life has become so pathetic.
[1192.48] I didn't even imagine that Faiq
is going to treat me this way.
[1196.84] And this Faisal is hanging
like a sword over my head.
[1201.16] Now he has started blackmailing.
[1229.11] What are you doing?
[1231.73] I should be the one asking that. 
What are you doing?
[1235.30] What's wrong? Give me my phone.
[1239.81] Would you like to explain? You
said you are going to meet your friend.
[1243.57] Well she is my friend.
[1245.72] Stop lying, Faiq.
[1247.94] What's there to lie? 
She is my school friend.
[1251.08] She might have been your friend in school,
[1252.30] but now you are openly
having an affair with her.
[1255.05] What are you saying?
Are you in your senses?
[1257.28] Don't try to act too innocent. 
I know everything.
[1259.91] The way you are busy on chat and
call, ignoring me, I understand everything.
[1264.06] What?
[1265.34] Tell me, who is this girl because
of whom you are ignoring me?
[1269.58] What are you doing, Nosheen, leave me.
[1272.42] I'm going to tell your mother. I'll
tell everyone that you are a fraud.
[1277.23] Look, Nosheen, Sania
is just my friend, that's it.
[1281.14] Do you think I'm a fool?
[1285.01] I know very well that you
are having an affair with him.
[1287.62] Friends do not meet in private like that,
they don't take such slefies together.
[1291.31] You know what, Nosheen? 
You're a sick person.
[1294.37] Get yourself treated.
[1340.00] Sister, how are you doing?
[1342.39] Wow, great. Eventually this day came too.
[1349.22] When Liaqat told me that you are
here then I asked him again to confirm.
[1354.42] Why? Can't I come here?
[1357.98] The doors of this house will
always be open for you and Zoya.
[1364.67] But if you both don't like
it here, what can I do then.
[1374.59] No, it's nothing like that.
[1377.65] The situations get so that...
[1380.88] What else? What brought you here?
[1383.84] I was waiting
[1385.37] that my sister is going to call me
and check up if  I am dong all right.
[1388.51] But neither you called
nor you came to visit.
[1391.54] Everything is right in front of you.
[1393.46] I have visited your place
so many times to reconcile.
[1399.59] But then I lost hope and stopped trying.
[1407.23] You and Zoya are continuously
holding me responsible.
[1414.17] I'm a human too, how much can I tolerate?
[1420.56] You know very well that I
never wanted this to happen.
[1423.40] I can understand, sister.
[1425.70] That's why I am here to
make up for my mistake.
[1430.40] I've realized what you have said.
[1433.45] What did I say?
[1435.03] You said that blood relations
should never cut off from each other.
[1440.05] You are absolutely right.
[1442.42] Blood relation can never be cut off.
[1444.69] It's good that you guys got it.
[1447.53] Otherwise I was just fed up visiting
your house and trying to appease you.
[1452.29] You are right, sister. I misbehaved
with you so much for no reason.
[1458.89] Anyway, I feel good that you came.
[1461.39] I have realized that staying
together is better for both of us.
[1468.73] Until we are one, nobody
can dare to move us.
[1472.80] You have got it, I have got it
but Zoya still doesn't understand.
[1478.09] What do you mean?
[1479.33] Tell your daughter to
stay in good terms with me.
[1483.63] She talks back at me,
[1485.94] I'm not just her auntie now, I'm her mother
in law. She should at least regard that.
[1493.24] What can I say about kids these days.
[1495.79] Now look at Nosheen, 
after all I have forgiven her, didn’t I?
[1501.77] You should ignore such
little things by Zoya too.
[1505.16] And I'm sure. She will get better with
time too. Everything is going to be fine.
[1511.48] And I have decide.
[1514.85] No matter what the situation is
but we have to support each other.
[1522.37] Anyway, aren't you going
to offer me any tea today?
[1525.82] Why not, in fact I'll
ask them to serve lunch.
[1542.69] Here, Faiq, have some water.
[1545.53] Salman, I can't stay
with this girl anymore.
[1549.18] -I really want to quit.
-Will you tell me what happened?
[1553.66] Same old quarreling. Same old problems.
[1557.92] I can't tolerate this girl anymore, 
I have had it now.
[1564.73] You don't take such decisions
of leaving home so emotionally.
[1569.09] What do you think? I am saying all
this just because I am emotional now?
[1573.37] Yeah.
[1574.78] For God's sake man, this
hasn't happened the first time,
[1577.75] it's not the first incident.
[1579.08] I have told all this to you already.
[1582.95] I don't have this much temperament.
[1585.55] Faiq, men have temperament.
[1587.82] That's why they have been
made the decision makers.
[1592.07] And you shouldn't take
this decision emotionally.
[1594.10] Really? She may keep
doubting me, taunting me,
[1598.46] keep fighting with me, and you
say that I am not facing much?
[1601.92] I didn't say that at all.
[1604.70] But the things you tell me
those are really common for girls.
[1609.37] Getting jealous, taunting, all
these factors are very normal.
[1614.87] I don't think there's
anything strange about it.
[1616.71] Salman, whatever you say but I
am not interested in this girl anymore.
[1621.01] -Should I say something?
-What?
[1623.43] I have a feeling that
you regret marrying her.
[1628.77] As soon as you got married to
her, you have lost interest in her.
[1633.57] May be.
[1634.65] Please don't mind, Faiq,
[1637.90] but as much it was her fault,
you are equally responsible for it.
[1643.12] Whether you agree
or not, that is the truth.
[1645.98] Yes, probably you are right.
[1650.73] Finding happiness by hurting
others may never find peace.
[1655.87] I think you shall distance
yourself from Sania.
[1661.32] Not just your wife, 
no girl would like that.
[1664.60] But Salman, I am not
having any affair with Sania.
[1668.73] I am sure that's how it is, but still.
[1672.27] She doesn't have issue with Sania
only. She has a problem with everyone.
[1676.37] She is an immature girl, very careless.
[1680.35] That's why I am unable to like her.
[1682.29] Tell me, does auntie know what
is going on between your two?
[1686.66] Mom knows everything,
she lives under the same roof.
[1689.86] She has an idea about
everything, and still she lectures me.
[1692.97] That's a good thing.
[1695.33] It is good but I can't say much in
front of her, because this was my wish.
[1700.78] Anyway, go home and sort it out now.
[1703.92] No, I'm not going home. 
I have to go for some work.
[1709.04] Are you going to Sania's place?
[1719.32] But you always stay so
chilled out, what's wrong today?
[1723.26] Did your wife throw you out of the house?
[1726.86] -You guessed it right.
-Oh, no problem.
[1731.35] If she threw you out then go back to her.
[1734.23] Dad, I wanted to talk
to you about something.
[1738.76] Sure, go ahead. I have to talk to you too.
[1742.62] But you go first.
[1745.83] I was just thinking Dad that
[1749.67] for everyone's benefit, I take
Zoya and move out from here.
[1755.17] Auntie, tell you son to stop.
[1758.14] -Is everything all right? What happened?
-Your son is fooling around with girls.
[1762.56] How can you say that?
[1764.46] Whatever I'm saying is the truth.
[1766.13] He keeps talking to girls all day long,
meet them privately and what not.
[1771.03] Nosheen, how can you talk
like that about your husband?
[1774.41] I'm not just accusing him. I
have proof of all his cheap deeds.
