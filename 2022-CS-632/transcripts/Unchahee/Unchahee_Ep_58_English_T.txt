[0.07] From flowers and from buds
[4.64] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.23] When I saw you
[14.38] I learned to chirp from you
[19.02] I had informed Faiq,
if he comes I'll go with him.
[23.89] Otherwise, I'll go myself.
[26.41] Why will you go alone? Go with Faiq.
[29.37] And if he gets stuck in dome
work then I'll go with you.
[33.97] Forget it, auntie,
I know what is he busy with.
[38.13] Since when you are
tolerating his blackmailing?
[40.51] And why didn't you tell me before?
[42.17] Actually, I got scared
[44.90] that if I tell something to
someone, things might get worse.
[51.35] -You're mad.
-I just got scared.
[55.27] Doesn't matter if anyone
knows about it or not,
[57.45] I'm going to tell everyone that all this
is a drama and I'm not going to be a mom.
[61.13] What did you get me into, Mom?
[63.34] Actually, after telling all this at least
I am going to take the burden off me.
[66.56] Why were you doing it?
[72.60] What is wrong?
What is it, just listen to me.
[77.66] -Shall I tell you something?
-Sure.
[80.87] -Faiq called.
-Really?
[83.73] He was saying that we
shall go for dinner today
[86.20] as it's been such a long
time that we didn't go.
[88.16] Wow, that's great.
[91.46] Auntie. I think Faiq is getting
on track through your schooling.
[98.35] Otherwise he wouldn't have changed.
[100.43] Nosheen, you're too much.
[103.21] I am telling the truth, auntie.
Otherwise, Faiq doesn't listen so easily.
[108.14] Okay, fine. Go now and choose what
dress you are going to wear tonight.
[113.58] It's too soon to get ready. And not
just me, you are coming with us too.
[119.07] No, I am not in the mood to go at all.
[122.34] You both just go and
enjoy with each other.
[125.23] Who has asked you
[129.38] if you are in the mood or not?
[130.83] I am telling you that you are coming
with us, so go and choose your dress too.
[135.67] Nosheen, don't be stubborn, 
try to understand.
[139.75] You are being stubborn which is of no use.
[144.95] And listen, you know, me and Faiq
are going for shopping too in the evening.
[150.22] Really did Faiq say this to you?
[154.16] Yes, Auntie. You know he
was talking to me so nicely
[158.82] that I couldn't believe it's Faiq.
[161.34] Great. May God keeps
you both happy just like this.
[165.39] Yeah I should thank God too,
otherwise my own evil eye might jinx it.
[170.31] Okay, auntie, shall I go rest for a while?
[172.80] Sure, rest for a while and then get ready.
[197.88] Faiq, what's wrong?
[200.51] Nothing.
[202.28] Didn't you have an important meeting
today? Why didn't you go to office?
[208.25] You had a meeting at 11:00 am.
[210.67] Yeah, it slipped my mind.
[215.52] What is it? I have noticed since
many days, you seem disturbed.
[220.10] No, it's nothing like that.
[225.63] Anyway, tell me, you came to
ask me something yesterday.
[229.43] Yeah, I came to you to
check how you are doing.
[233.94] Okay.
[235.71] -Don't I seem disturbed to you now?
-You still do.
[241.08] aren't you going to ask me the reason?
[243.85] I will definitely listen if
you would like to tell.
[247.51] Maybe I can help you.
[253.43] you can't do anything.
[256.86] Nobody can do anything.
[259.56] Why are you saying such depressing things?
[263.11] There is a solution to everything, Zaid.
[267.28] No, Aima, at times
some things have no solution.
[273.06] And even if they do then a person
become really helpless at times.
[279.35] I know that very well.
[282.05] We all have built a lot
of pressure on you, right?
[288.05] It's not like that.
[290.50] And then, I have become
your compulsion too.
[298.07] Aima, I have taken your responsibility.
[301.62] You are not my compulsion.
[304.62] So, am I just a responsibility for you?
[314.22] A person desires to
achieve a lot in his life,
[320.23] but it isn't necessary
that he gets every thing.
[326.29] Anyway, don't worry. Zoya's
matter is going to be resolved soon.
[331.37] Do you love Zoya that much?
[338.08] What difference does that make now?
[341.31] Anyways, I'm heading towards
office, do you want to come?
[350.50] Okay.
[352.49] Zaid,
[355.14] you, may...
[358.14] I wanted to talk to you about something.
[362.20] What is it?
[367.61] I, I want that...
[372.80] you give me a divorce.
[420.55] What happened, Shabana?
[423.66] Isn't sister home? Has she gone somewhere?
[426.94] Her friend called.
[429.78] She was saying that sister
isn't answering her phone.
[432.38] I thought of telling her myself.
[434.70] Yeah, she has gone out
somewhere for shopping.
[438.58] Oh, okay.
[443.47] -Are you worried about something?
-Nothing.
[451.67] I know what you are worried about.
[458.25] I'm worried about the same thing.
[461.89] What are you referring to, Shabana?
[464.63] I am talking about children,
[467.46] our children.
[469.48] Aima, Zaid and Zoya.
[476.15] Brother,
[478.86] I think they aren't happy.
[485.22] I think that we
[489.32] have tied them in this
relationship by force.
[494.59] Anyway,
[497.11] it isn't that easy either.
[499.94] keeping relations intact,
[502.30] and that too in such conditions.
[506.73] Brother,
[509.61] don't you think that they are
going through a huge trial?
[515.50] Yes, you are right, and we
have put them in this trial.
[522.29] How can a person know that the decisions
he is taking will prove to be wrong.
[528.33] If one gets to know then no one would
let their children go through this pain.
[534.03] -Yes.
-Did Aima say something to you?
[540.76] No, she doesn't say anything,
[544.38] but I can figure out everything
just by looking at her,
[550.38] what is going on inside her.
[552.81] Yeah, I have an idea too.
[555.65] May I come in?
[557.58] Hammad, dear!
[559.93] -Greetings, auntie.
-Greetings, I am so happy to see you.
[564.28] Didn't you miss us since so long?
[566.85] Missed you all a lot, that's why I'm back.
[570.49] -How are you doing, Dad?
-I'm good, come sit.
[574.74] Please sit, I'll go meet others.
[578.46] All right.
[622.05] Hello, greetings, mama.
[625.42] Yeah, I'm at home.
[629.09] Really?
[630.67] That's great news.
[632.80] Yeah, I'll visit you in the evening.
[636.05] How can I come right now?
Even Faiq isn't home right now.
[643.95] Okay, fine, let me see.
[646.51] Bye.
[659.08] Faiq,
[660.92] -You know what?
-What?
[663.38] Mama just called. She was telling
me that Hammad has returned home.
[668.74] That's nice.
[671.25] Faiq, aren't you excited at all?
[675.56] You are getting over excited, you brother
is back. What do I have to do with him?
[679.87] Can't you be happy for me?
[682.75] What nonsense, Nosheen?
[684.71] Of course, I'm the one
saying all the nonsense.
[688.10] Look, now don't you start with that. 
I am already too tired.
[692.56] If Sania had messaged you right now
then you wouldn't have been tired.
[695.81] Oh, shut up, Nosheen,
what are you saying?
[697.91] I'm saying the truth.
[699.18] You aren't even happy about our
kid, you have to do with him at least.
[703.23] Nosheen, I think it's been so
many days that we didn't have a fight,
[706.44] may be that's why you aren't at ease.
What do you want?
[709.40] Obviously, I am the one starting
all the fights, you are so innocent.
[713.55] If this is what you plan
to do then I shall leave.
[716.13] No, you stay here, sit here, I'm leaving.
[720.05] Nosheen!
[746.68] He just got back from work. May be
he is actually upset about something.
[753.14] That's nothing new, he is upset
about one thing or the other all the time.
[757.14] Okay, fine, you don't lose heart.
[760.22] I think Faiq is taking revenge from me.
[762.99] -Revenge? What for?
-For getting married to me.
[766.37] I don't understand what's 
the use of arguing about the past?
[770.78] I was so happy, I thought that
we will go to mom's to meet him.
[775.27] Okay, then, he will go with you.
[778.37] With this mood, even I am not going there.
[782.47] Let him rest for a while.
[788.98] Come on, get up. Go get his clothes ready
and get ready yourself too. I'll make tea.
[794.18] I'm not going, auntie.
I don't feel like talking to him.
[798.61] Oh come on, you have started it again.
[803.50] Didn't I just explain you?
[806.24] Auntie, I think Faiq is sad
about not getting married to Aima.
[812.08] Nosheen, that is history now.
Just forget it.
[816.31] What difference does it make if I
forget it or not, Faiq remembers it.
[820.66] And he regrets it a lot.
[823.44] I don't think so, 
but maybe that's the case.
[826.60] That is the case, auntie.
[828.65] Aima has cursed us so
that we don't stay happy.
[833.59] No, Nosheen, Aim can never curse anyone.
[839.58] -Really? How can you say that?
-My heart tells me that.
[845.72] And, she had forgiven us all that day,
[851.43] and said that whatever has
happened is my fate only.
[856.00] It might be that she said
something but she didn't meant it.
[860.45] No, Nosheen,
[862.52] I know Aima very well, she can never lie.
[887.04] I have filed a case on you, Zoya,
[889.77] that you are threatening
me to kill my unborn child.
[893.63] You are harassing me.
[895.51] You'll get a legal notice
from my lawyer tomorrow.
[975.73] Stop blaming yourself.
[978.23] Besides, if you are going to lose
hope who is going to take care of Aima?
[982.16] I know.
[985.05] That's why I will have to marry Aima.
[1016.15] I don't know anything, you just
can't leave now, I'm telling you.
[1022.26] Mama, you shall tie his
feet so that he can't go now.
[1028.78] Hey, no need to be so cruel.
[1030.41] You guys said it, that's enough for me.
[1033.22] Okay then, let's cancel this plan.
[1037.39] Thank you so much for taking my side.
[1040.72] By the way, you didn't
come to my wedding,
[1044.35] so now you will have to
buy me a very nice gift.
[1048.15] That's not a problem, just
name it and I will get it for you.
[1054.86] Mama, where is Zaid?
[1057.15] He has gone to office, I've called
him, he must be coming any moment.
[1060.75] okay, and Aima? 
Isn't she back yet either?
[1067.17] She'll be here soon too.
You're here for now, right?
[1069.64] Yes, Dad, I'll go after having dinner.
[1072.94] So, aren't you going to...
[1073.98] He isn't going anywhere from
here, and I won't let him go either.
[1081.81] I'll pack my stuff in a couple
of days and move here then.
[1087.20] -Promise?
-Yes, Mom, promise.
[1090.34] Faiq was here with you too,
where did he go?
[1092.86] Yes, Dad, he is talking
to someone outside.
[1095.57] Excuse me? He's talking?
[1101.02] Address him respectfully,
he is your husband.
[1103.09] Oh, please!
[1106.33] He is right, you should
address him with respect.
[1110.09] All this is because of you. See,
now I am getting schooled now.
[1114.52] Tell me one thing, how much trouble
have you caused to your mother in law?
[1119.90] It's nothing like that. Ask dad, I have
a great friendship with my mother in law.
[1124.51] Yeah right, this is how it is
in the beginning, right Mama?
[1127.16] Yes, of course, right?
[1128.93] But tell me, Mama...
[1150.85] -Greetings.
-Greetings.
[1153.90] -How are you doing?
-I'm good.
[1158.60] How are you?
[1161.51] I'm not good.
[1163.79] What happened? All good?
[1167.59] No.
[1170.19] You seem quite worried.
[1175.04] Aima, you haven't forgiven me, right?
[1179.24] It's not like that.
[1184.13] It is like that.
[1186.57] I know that you haven't forgiven me.
[1189.45] How can you say that?
[1192.90] Because I am unhappy.
[1198.70] I am unhappy even after trying so hard.
[1205.49] I had never loved Nosheen.
[1211.48] Don't know why I listened to her that day?
[1215.98] I didn't understand what
has happened with me.
[1218.54] It takes two to tango, Faiq.
[1224.73] If you hadn't loved Nosheen,
[1227.11] you wouldn't have done all
that what you did that night.
[1229.97] Aima, please believe me I...
[1232.16] I don't need any of your justifications.
[1236.45] And I do not regret at all of
not getting married to you.
[1240.05] -Aima...
-I'm not done yet.
[1242.94] If you think that you are unhappy
because I haven't forgiven you
[1252.87] then I forgive you sincerely.
[1260.30] Thank you.
[1263.56] But I have one request.
[1266.46] -What?
-Nosheen is a kid, she is very innocent.
[1271.60] Whatever she had done
was just a childish act by her.
[1280.50] But I want you to forget all that. 
She is your wife now.
[1334.09] So, to meet you now we
will have to wait for so long?
[1339.05] No, it's not like that. I went to the
office and then I was in my room.
[1347.32] And you didn't come to meet me?
[1350.56] Actually, I didn't know that you are here.
[1354.88] Okay, fine, I forgive you.
[1358.94] Thanks a lot.
[1364.01] Aima,
[1367.62] look here,
[1371.04] towards me.
[1373.00] What is it?
[1374.81] -You tell me that.
-What do you mean?
[1378.13] Means, why aren't you happy?
[1380.70] No, it's nothing like that.
[1383.75] Oh, really?
[1387.37] Aima, you know that we have
been raised together since childhood.
[1393.90] And I always figure out by looking at
your face if there is something wrong.
[1397.64] There is nothing as such.
[1399.11] Well, I must be have wrong vibes then.
[1402.40] Forget me, you tell me how
you are doing, and your wife...
[1408.71] You still know how to change
the topic like you used to.
[1413.88] Anyway, I'm good.
[1417.59] Me and my wife aren't together
anymore, we are separated.
[1425.45] Sorry about that.
[1429.35] Actually, I'm happy.
[1431.97] Well, good for you then.
[1435.46] Aima, actually I believe
[1437.77] that if you don't get happiness through 
a relationship, then you should end it.
[1446.62] And at times one has to break the
relationships for others' happiness too.
[1451.82] Aima,
[1455.23] shall I ask you one thing?
[1459.11] Yes?
[1461.95] -Are you and Zaid...
-We both are parting our ways.
[1470.46] I am taking divorce from Zaid.
[1475.47] Zaid and Zoya love each other a lot.
[1482.96] I was just forced into their lives.
[1487.87] -Aima.
-Yes?
[1491.58] May I ask you something?
[1495.12] Sure.
[1498.92] Do you still love Zaid?
[1524.60] Aima, you haven't
forgiven me yet, have you?
[1527.97] There is nothing as such.
[1533.67] It is like that.
[1536.14] I know that you haven't forgiven me.
[1539.07] How can you say that?
[1542.46] Because I am unhappy.
[1548.25] I am unhappy even after trying so hard.
[1550.72] I have never loved Nosheen.
[1583.98] What's wrong, Faiq?
[1588.16] -Nothing.
-You didn't sleep.
[1593.95] You go, I'll be there in a while.
[1673.99] Faiq, come, breakfast is ready.
[1720.56] Faiq!
[1738.09] Hello, Faiq.
[1741.31] Where are you?
[1745.02] What? You went to office?
[1752.73] Okay.
[1754.84] All right.
[1769.09] Who are you? This is my husband's number.
[1774.84] What? How? How is he doing now?
[1781.99] Nosheen, who was it on the phone?
[1785.25] -Aren't you angry with me, Aima?
-Why would I be angry with you, Nosheen?
[1790.09] You know, I have always
deliberately given trouble to you.
[1796.37] I have always teased you deliberately.
[1799.34] I have decided to divorce Aima.
[1802.44] Why are you leaving her, Zaid?
[1805.41] Just because I don't like her?
[1807.82] Or because I am going to
be the mother of your child?
[1812.81] If that's the case then
[1817.34] I have lied to you.
[1823.71] I'm not expecting.
