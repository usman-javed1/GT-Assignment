[0.08] From flowers and from buds
[4.64] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.23] When I saw you
[14.17] I learned how to chirp from you
[18.93] Faisal, what do you think? Am I
going to still get blackmailed by you?
[23.01] Look, I didn't say anything like that.
[25.89] Do one thing, tell anyone
anything you want to.
[32.76] I am not going to be
intimidated by your threats, got it?
[35.56] I never think wrong about you,
[38.90] but it's true that I like
to spend time with you.
[43.54] Is this something that
is acceptable for a wife?
[49.59] Answer me.
[51.04] How can you block me from here?
[54.12] -Faisal, go away from here, I say go away.
-Nosheen, who is it?
[58.08] Greetings, auntie. I'm Faisal.
[60.63] She is only going to stay with
you when you will divorce Aima.
[65.69] -What if I don't do that?
-Up to you.
[68.72] You can forget about Zoya
and your kid then.
[72.65] -Are you threatening me?
-You can think of it whatever you like.
[77.00] But Zoya is not going to
change her decision now.
[99.51] What's wrong, Nosheen,
you didn't get ready yet?
[103.24] Auntie, I was just going to.
[106.87] You might get late. What time was
your appointment with the doctor?
[110.37] 2:00 pm.
[112.21] Oh, okay.
[114.30] You are going with Faiq, right?
[118.12] I had informed Faiq,
if he comes I'll go with him.
[123.86] Otherwise, I'll go myself.
[126.40] Why will you go alone? Go with Faiq.
[129.36] And if he gets stuck in dome
work then I'll go with you.
[133.91] Forget it, auntie,
I know what is he busy with.
[137.63] Why are you thinking like that?
[139.28] If you'll think positive all
positive things will happen.
[142.10] I am thinking right, auntie.
[144.19] You know, even after so much
has happened, he still meets Sania.
[148.37] He talks to her secretly.
[150.81] Yes, I have an idea.
[154.46] -If you know it why don't you do anything?
-I can't stop him.
[158.60] Because he won't stop if I'll stop him.
[161.29] Means all this is going
to carry on like that?
[166.14] -No.
-What are you trying to say?
[169.83] What shall I do that he stops?
[173.24] You'll have to make
your place in his heart.
[176.12] And you’ll have to make him
realize that you love him sincerely.
[179.69] Auntie, Faiq married me
after he believed on this fact.
[185.75] Forget about how you guys got married.
[198.11] I don't understand what that Sania has
that Faiq is still after her.
[203.89] Whereas I am much
more beautiful than Sania.
[207.23] It's not about beauty.
[210.19] Then what is it about? A man
needs freedom and peace only.
[217.73] If a woman keeps nagging at home
all the time and there is no peace left
[222.50] a man looks for these things outside then.
[227.44] And then, wherever he gets peace and
freedom, he gets attached there.
[232.33] So, isn't there any peace in our home?
[235.38] There is, but not like
the peace that he wants.
[241.50] Means, you consider Faiq as right?
[246.51] You think whatever he is doing is right?
[249.56] Not at all, I am not one of those mothers
[253.20] who keep taking their son's
side even if he is at fault.
[257.55] But you always keep telling me to correct
myself. Why don't you say anything to him?
[262.45] It's not like that, I tell him that too.
But you should understand this too.
[270.16] It's in nature of men,
[272.24] as much as they are prohibited
or stopped to do something,
[274.50] they get attracted to that thing as much.
[277.01] Then what should I do? Should I keep
watching their affair and close my eyes?
[284.02] -I have just one solution now.
-What's that?
[287.76] I'll tell my family everything
clearly and leave this house.
[295.99] A wise woman deals
with all these problems.
[300.45] She never runs away by leaving her home.
[302.85] I am fed up now, I can't
deal with it everyday.
[306.65] Faiq has sworn upon me
[309.26] that he has no illicit
relation with Sania.
[316.23] And I believe that.
[318.35] Okay, if you say so.
[321.78] Nothing of this sort will happen.
[325.40] Just remember one thing.
[328.39] Solve every matter
calmly through discussion.
[333.11] Loud voice makes  what
you are saying lose its effect .
[337.46] Do you get it?
[347.22] Hello, Faiq,
[353.63] Yeah, I'll be ready in 5 minutes.
[360.87] Faiq is coming, isn't he?
[362.90] -Yeah, I'll get ready.
-Go get ready nicely.
[454.84] Mom, I told you not to do this
drama, but no, you don't listen to me.
[459.98] Now bear with this situation.
[463.03] Hey, what's wrong?
Why are you getting so hyper?
[467.96] Mom, because the problem that you have got
me into, I am unable to deal with that.
[472.70] -You don't have to do anything.
-Why not?
[477.84] If we have a fight with Zaid
and if he files a case on us, then?
[482.66] Have you ever thought about it?
[485.85] Oh, I'm telling you, they
aren't going to do anything.
[490.16] And Zaid, he isn't able to do anything.
[492.77] Won't do anything? How
do you know that they won't?
[495.72] What's wrong with you
Zoya, why are you yelling?
[498.81] Do you want everyone to know?
[500.90] Doesn't matter if anyone gets to
know about it or not,
[503.10] I'm going to tell everyone
that all this is a drama,
[508.81] and I'm not going to be a mom.
[510.43] What did you get me into, Mom?
[512.91] Actually, after telling all this at least
I am going to take the burden off me.
[515.81] Why were you doing it ma...
[539.64] Hello,  hello, Zoya?
[543.06] -Zoya?
-Mom, Aima has heard everything.
[547.80] What?
[561.18] Thank God, everything is fine.
[564.34] Yeah, you just have to
take care of yourself now.
[567.38] Take good diet, juices
and have lots of fruits.
[572.60] Why? Aren't you going to take care of me?
[577.22] Nosheen, why do you deduce
the opposite of everything?
[581.45] What am I saying to you
and what are you answering?
[583.63] What did I say?
[587.24] I can't stay at home at
serve you all the time.
[593.12] So, I'll tell you to take care of
yourself. Stop being stubborn like kids.
[597.90] I was just joking.
[600.51] A person is not in a mood to
joke that he can get your jokes.
[608.44] What's wrong? I was just
trying to make this moment nice
[613.88] and you are getting angry for no reason.
[617.52] Nosheen, you are so complaining.
Every person has a limit of tolerance.
[623.77] And with you my limit is
crossed. I am sick of you.
[674.51] Well, let me tell you then.
[676.85] Zoya has told them
[678.87] that she will continue her pregnancy
only when Zaid gives you a divorce.
[699.12] To make you feel even better I
wanted to tell you a good news.
[703.54] Good news?
[706.41] Prepare yourself to run around.
[712.39] Sister, brother Azmat,
[715.41] you both are going to become grandparents.
[727.00] Yes, my Zoya is expecting.
[768.69] Okay, first relax
[770.63] and tell me in detail that since when
are you tolerating his blackmailing?
[775.08] And why didn't you tell me before?
[777.03] Actually, I got scared
[779.49] that if I tell something to
someone, things might get worse.
[785.96] You are mad.
[787.41] -I just got afraid.
-And these loafers take advantage of this fear.
[792.51] You're right.
[794.87] Just wait and watch what
I am going to do to him.
[798.24] Just don't get too angry,
please stay relaxed.
[805.16] What if something else happens?
He is a very cheap and cunning person.
[809.62] He can't do anything to me. Send
me his details, first. All the details
[815.61] What numbers did he
use to send you messages
[817.50] and used to call you,
send me everything.
[819.48] I am going to take care of him today.
[820.98] I'll just send you after I go home.
[825.20] Send me right now!
[826.56] I'll search and send you then.
[829.73] Please don't get so angry,
I'm scared for you.
[833.44] Nosheen, nothing will
happen to me, don't worry.
[838.09] What if he tells everything to Faiq?
[842.41] Didn't tell you,
[843.96] he won't even think about you after
today letting alone contacting you.
[851.92] Tell me, have you told
about it to anyone else?
[855.84] No, just my mother in
law knows everything.
[862.40] What have you done?
[865.28] -And what if she tells Faiq?
-She won't tell him.
[870.34] How can you trust her?
[872.39] She takes my side more than Faiq's. That's
why she won't tell anything to Faiq.
[877.68] Just consider her as my
friend and my confidante too.
[886.44] Don't know, you have done something silly.
[889.98] -Anyway...
-Don't worry about her just take care of yourself.
[897.70] I'm fine, nothing is going to
happen to me. I'll drop you now.
[903.85] And send me his details
as soon as you reach home.
[908.02] -Understand?
-Yes, I'll send you.
[913.43] -Can I say something?
-Yes, what is it?
[917.13] Why don't you come back home now?
[920.69] Dad is changed too.
[922.73] I know, he is changed.
[926.10] -How do you know?
-I went to the hospital.
[929.55] Okay.
[931.97] I met Zaid too.
[933.96] Zaid? What did he say?
[936.71] Nothing much, he just
gave me dad's message.
[941.01] Message? What message?
[943.47] -I'll tell you later.
-Come on, tell me.
[947.91] Told you, I'll tell you later.
[949.87] By the way, Zaid has told
me few other things too.
[954.04] He told me the good news too.
[956.45] Congratulations.
[958.79] Thank you.
[960.53] I am going to give you
all a surprise too soon.
[963.70] Surprise? What surprise?
[966.02] As I said, it's a surprise.
[968.38] Let's go now, I'll drop you. And give
me all his details right away, okay?
[973.85] Okay fine.
[997.68] -Isn't Zaid home?
-No, he must be at office.
[1002.15] I called office too, I talked
to them but he isn't there.
[1006.51] Really? Zoya and Aima are home too.
[1010.36] Where did he go then?
[1012.06] Well, he might have gone
for some work or to his friends.
[1021.90] -What's wrong?
-Nothing.
[1024.37] I have a feeling that you
want to say something.
[1029.97] Do you know?
[1032.99] He came to meet me.
[1035.60] Really? Are you serious?
[1040.23] Why didn't you tell me? When did he come?
[1042.78] He came to the hospital,
when I was admitted, then.
[1045.87] Really? Thank God.
[1048.56] -So, did he say something?
-Yeah, he did.
[1054.38] He was apologizing.
[1056.31] So? Did you forgive him then?
[1061.01] Look, you have forgiven Nosheen, too.
[1063.60] Besides, he is our eldest son, we
have raised him with so much love.
[1069.16] Yeah.
[1071.71] Parents make so many efforts, go through
so much difficulties to raise their kids.
[1080.08] But they don't realize it at all.
[1083.83] They just think that the parents have
fulfilled their responsibility, that's it.
[1088.08] No, they do realize it when
they become parents themselves.
[1095.57] You are right.
[1096.89] Tell me honestly, Azmat,
why didn't Hammad come home?
[1101.21] Didn't you treat him right?
[1106.37] He is so stubborn. I'll call
him and ask him to come.
[1110.27] No need to call him. If he is
stubborn then I am his father too.
[1116.91] Whoever wants to come
will come by himself.
[1122.22] By the way, one thing made me happy,
[1126.68] that Nosheen's mother in
law is very happy with her.
[1129.69] Looks like she is trying to
make her marriage work.
[1138.60] What happened?
[1140.92] What is wrong?
What is it, just listen to me.
[1143.59] Why are you hitting me?
[1146.27] Do you know who I am? Recognize me?
[1148.75] -We are just friends.
-I am your death!
[1163.60] Do you recognize who I am?
[1165.53] I haven't done anything
bad to her, listen to me.
[1168.19] Nosheen, yes! Do you remember now?
[1171.52] I took just a little money
from her, I'll return.
[1174.01] I am going to take all the money back,
you will have to return them, understood?
[1196.57] Yes, Mr. Safdar,
Zaid here, what is it?
[1210.77] Look, I have decided,
please get the papers ready.
[1216.62] I have to file a case
on my wife at any cost.
[1220.41] I want my child at any cost, I won't
get threatened by anyone for that.
[1228.09] Okay. Okay.
[1232.37] -What happened, Zaid?
-Nothing.
[1234.94] You seem worried, is
there a problem at office?
[1239.15] No, you tell me, did you want anything?
[1241.27] Yes, I wanted to talk
to you about something.
[1244.32] -What is it?
-Actually, Zaid,
[1248.72] -I wanted to...
-What is it, Aima? Just say it.
[1252.12] Actually, Zaid...
[1257.06] Zaid, I wanted to...
[1258.05] Zaid, you're here? I was
looking for you inside.
[1268.31] What were you saying, Aima?
What did you want to talk me about?
[1273.45] Zaid, dad is looking for you inside,
[1276.38] he wants to talk to you
about something important, come.
[1297.31] Were you trying to tell Zaid?
[1299.47] First, you did something very unethical,
[1301.64] You eavesdropped outside my room
[1303.37] and then you
are telling it to Zaid?
[1308.89] -Aren't you ashamed?
-Should I be ashamed or you?
[1316.56] You are the one who is doing
such a big fraud with Zaid, not me.
[1319.41] -And it is not a small thing.
-And you?
[1323.15] What opinion do you
have about yourself, Aima?
[1324.85] Me? What did I do?
[1327.64] Aima, you didn't care about my emotions.
[1330.57] And I used to trust you
the most in this world.
[1335.98] And you didn't even consider it.
[1340.09] You made a promise to me, didn't
you? What happened to that promise?
[1343.94] Tell me, why aren't you saying something?
[1348.51] You were my friend, right?
Why did you do it to me then?
[1354.38] I didn't consider you as a
friend by my sister, Aima.
[1357.74] And you were the most
important person for me.
[1360.55] I never needed a sister because I had you.
[1365.41] And that friend wants to ruin
me instead of supporting me.
[1373.27] She wants to ruin my marriage.
[1378.23] Look, Zoya, I don't
want anything like that.
[1381.22] What do you think,
[1382.94] that if you are going to tell this
to Zaid, won't he react over it?
[1387.44] -Yes but you told such a big lie to Zaid.
-Yes, I lied, I lied to him.
[1391.82] And you are the reason for that, Aima.
[1396.71] You took away my happiness.
[1399.06] And I'm not doing all this happily.
[1402.02] I'm compelled to do it.
[1406.48] If you want to ruin my
life then go, tell it to Zaid.
[1414.58] I won't stop you, Aima.
But remember one thing,
[1419.17] After that I will lose
trust on friendship.
[1440.34] Just tell me that in such a situation,
can the husband file a legal case or not?
[1447.33] Oh, I know all that.
[1450.72] Just get me all the details
about this issue and inform me.
[1454.33] Yeah, do it quickly, I’ll be waiting.
[1460.17] Okay.
[1466.31] If he files such a case then I will
have to handle Zaid in some other way,
[1471.09] otherwise, there will be a huge problem.
[1517.03] If you aren't sleeping
then at least talk to me.
[1520.34] I'm sleepy, it's better
that you sleep too.
[1524.10] I know you're angry with me.
[1526.69] I said, it would be better
if we don't talk right now.
[1530.18] In fact, if you want to go
to your mom's that fine too.
[1534.33] It's better that you leave
until the case is decided.
[1541.11] What decision?
[1545.05] Decision about the case.
[1547.30] I have filed a case on you, Zoya,
[1550.07] that you are threatening
me to kill my unborn child.
[1553.91] You are harassing me.
[1555.83] You'll get a legal notice
from my lawyer tomorrow.
[1615.34] We are going to work on the same strategy
now. Because I want full profit this year.
[1620.93] Okay, listen, I'll talk to you in a while.
[1625.18] But don't forget to
reply their email, okay.
[1629.84] Okay, bye.
[1631.53] Zoya, you this early in
the morning? Everything okay?
[1636.30] You should be thankful
that I came in the morning,
[1638.52] otherwise I was supposed
to come last night.
[1641.71] -What do you mean?
-The meaning is simple, Mom.
[1645.21] -I knew it already.
-What?
[1648.93] The game that we
started had to end one day.
[1654.58] Rather it hasn't ended yet.
[1660.67] Why are you talking in riddles, why don't
you tell me clearly what has happened?
[1665.18] Okay then, I'll tell you clearly.
[1671.03] Zaid has asked me to leave his home.
[1674.56] -How dare he ask my daughter to...
-He is very daring.
[1679.15] He is sending a notice in few days too.
[1682.34] What notice?
[1683.53] You are pretending to be so
innocent as if you don't know anything.
[1689.61] The fraud we had done with Zaid,
this reaction was expected on it.
[1694.14] You should be thankful that
he doesn't know the whole truth.
[1699.00] The day he gets to know about it, instead
of a notice he will send divorce papers.
[1706.04] Then let him send it, I don't care.
[1708.12] Why would you, Mom?
[1711.97] Besides, it's my life what
difference does it make to you?
[1714.87] I will be the one suffering.
[1717.75] Actually, you are right. Yeah.
[1722.16] What difference does it make to me?
It's not like I love you or anything.
[1728.24] I didn't mean that.
[1732.47] No, Zoya, you're right.
[1738.72] Yes, who am I to take
decisions about your life?
[1744.14] Please, Mom, can you stop?
[1747.04] Don't worry, Zoya, you won't
have any complaints with me now.
[1755.46] From now on I am not going to
interfere in your personal life at all.
[1762.76] Do what you feel is good for you.
[1781.73] I want that you...
[1785.80] divorce me.
[1790.76] -Greetings, auntie.
-Greetings, I am so happy to see you.
[1795.13] Didn't you miss us since so long?
[1797.66] Missed you all a lot, that's why I'm back.
[1801.28] How are you doing, Dad?
[1802.21] Look, please don't start that
again. I'm already too tired.
[1806.64] If Sania had messaged you right now
then you wouldn't have been tired.
[1809.97] Oh, shut up, Nosheen,
what are you saying?
[1812.05] I'm saying the truth.
[1813.30] You aren't even happy about our
kid, you are concerned with him at least.
[1816.97] I know that you haven't forgiven me.
[1819.94] How can you say that?
[1823.31] Because I am unhappy.
[1829.11] I am unhappy even after trying so hard.
[1831.13] If you don't get happiness through
a relationship, then you should end it.
[1839.22] And at times one has to break the
relationships for others' happiness too.
