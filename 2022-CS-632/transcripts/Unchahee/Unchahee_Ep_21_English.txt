From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you Sister, whatever Nosheen
has done, it's her mistake. If I am trying to get her
back to this house, it's because I want the environment
of this house get better. I know everything. There must be some hidden interest
of yours to bring Nosheen back home. You are doing all this
to look good in front of Azmat. I know everything. I love you, Zoya. I love you too, Zaid. You must be having so much fun by looking at all this situation. You must be enjoying a lot. Go ahead, enjoy. But I'm going to snatch all this happiness
away from you real soon. Amber, I can't find peace
even for a single moment. Not even at my home. I just feel less burdened
when I come to you. You should come then,
whenever you feel like. Why are you so worried?
Nosheen is back home too. I am really distressed because of Nosheen. Why? Has she done something again? But it bothers me how
she stays home all the time. No education, nothing to do,
nor she can go anywhere. Nobody talks to her at home, and I
keep scolding her all the time as well. Then don't scold her.
She did a mistake and paid for it. She has learned her lesson not
to attempt such a thing ever in life. But what is going to happen next, Amber? I don't see any signs
of a suitable proposal for her too. Why are you getting so disappointed?
It's not even her age to get married. Yes, you are right. Why don't you let her continue her studies? Let her take a good course. It would
be as better for you both as busy she gets. You are 100% right, Amber. But when the head of the family
has lost interest in his own daughter  then what course and what studies? At least talk to brother Azmat, he
considers education very important. All his focus is on Aima. Here she gets done with her studies and he has already offered her
a job in his company. These mother-daughter have
already ripped a lot of money from us and now this monthly salary too. I don't understand, what
was the need of all this? If she is done with her education, he should look for a good
match for her and get her married. Even I don't get it. Her mother is so content as if she doesn't
have to get her daughter married ever. Or maybe her daughter is one in a million that she will be getting
proposals even if she reaches 30. That's a very dangerous apprehension. By the way, nobody hires their relatives. You never know when
and where they deceive you, because they are trusted so much. What if she takes over the office? I can never trust anyone
when it come to my business. They are going to embezzle
everything that belongs to us and we will just keep looking, Amber. She doesn't seem like that though. But I don't get it why he doesn't care about his own
daughter and gives favors to others. That's the biggest
sorrow of my life, Amber, that instead of his
children and wife, Azmat is worried about his
sister and niece all the time. But don't surrender in front
of brother Azmat so easily. Either get Aima out of that office,
or send Nosheen with her as well. You are right. But brother Azmat doesn't seem like that. The things you tell about him,
he has never done such things before. He wasn't like that before, but gradually the love for his
sister and niece is increasing. But still, Nosheen did what she did, he can't deprive her of her rights. Take this upstairs. I'm surprised, you're early today. Yes, as the days that our children
will join our company are approaching I have started to work less. -Do you plan to retire?
-No, no. I will retire the day
my heart stops working. Please don't say things like that. You can be happy,
I won't get retired and stay at home. To stay busy in life, to keep
achieving one or the other goal, that's my principle, you know that. Teach your children
these golden rules as well. I am teaching them.
Everything will be done gradually. There have been a lot of
changes in Zaid in past few months. You have a child other
than Zaid in this house. Now that you have let her back home,
why don't you please forgive her as well? Why do you bring her up every time? I have let her back home,
isn't that enough? You have let her back in the house only. If you'll forgive her, things
will get back to normal. Look, whatever has happened,
we are responsible for that too. Not we, you. Just you and your fault. You have brought her up, not me. This is something you always do,
hide behind the obligations of your work. A father has a role too
in bringing up children. And what do I know where you
went using work as an excuse. Don't cross you limit, okay? I knew it that you can't display
good behaviour for much long. All right, I'm sorry. Listen, I need to talk
to you about Nosheen. I think you are forgetting that you
are going to agree with all my decisions. I remember my words, but I'm worried. What is it that you want? I want that you take Nosheen
with you to work like Aima. -That isn't possible.
-Why not? You said that Nosheen and
Aima both are like your children. Isn't it contradicting that one will go to
work and the other is going to stay home? There was a time like that, that's true, but now I openly declare
that I differentiate between her and Aima. Aima is like my daughter, while you
daughter is no where near her, got  it? You are depriving her of her rights. You are being cruel to Nosheen. Now matter how much you say
it, Aima can never be your child, and no matter how much you try,
Nosheen is going to remain your daughter. Please, please don't be so cruel. All right, let's assume. Even if I take
her to the office, what is she going to do? Any petty work,
the point is to keep her busy. I know very well what your
and your daughter's point is, you just want to send her to office to
copy Aima, there is no other reason. The thing is that your daughter
is not able to do anything. She can't even do
data entry in computer. Shall I take her to my office
to get myself mocked? Have you ever thought how
much you hurt her by doing all this? What if she does something wrong? Is there anything wrong left
that she could do? I mean to say that... what if she tries to take her life?
What are you going to do then? I am going to do what I have
been doing since past few days. One who loses respect in my eyes, it doesn't matter if he lives or dies. Nothing is going on.
I have lost the life I had left myself. I miss college so much. I wish I hadn't gotten trapped
by that scoundrel. My life would have been peaceful at least. Don't know where he is being a disgrace.
Who is he spending my money on. I pray to God everyday, may he get a painful death,
may the scumbag die while suffering. Okay, go then. Listen, call me some time,
I feel good when you do. Okay, bye. Hello, greetings, auntie. How are you doing? I'm fine. Auntie, I called to ask if you
checked with your contacts. What? There isn't anyone who
can find out about Faisal? Okay, bye. Everybody is just useless. I asked
one thing and even that can't be done. You have no idea how
happy I am after knowing this. I thought you would waste few
more years of your life by delaying it. I told you, mom, the day I find
a good guy I'm going to say yes. By the way, what are you further plans? I'll call Mrs. Rashid.
We all should meet once, We can discuss our
further plans after that. Sounds good. Ask them to
come this coming weekend. All right, I'll inform them. And yes, listen, I am not going
to do anything stupid. Neither am I going to serve them tea,
nor I am going to be shy in front of them. And I am going to talk as much as I want. And where I feel like I shouldn't talk,
I will go quiet there. Besides, I have already met Daniyal. Just want to judge his parents now. Don't you worry dear, they are
quiet progressive people themselves. I know Mrs. Rashid since long. But, tell me one thing, Doesn't Aima have any plans to get married? I don't think so. Aima wants to work with uncle and then MBA. So, I don't think she has any
plans of getting married right now. I think she should get married. Mom, everybody has
their own mindset. And one should do
what he is comfortable with. Besides, Aima is too simple. Wherever uncle and her
mom would ask her to marry, she would abide them
without saying anything. I think she should be thankful for whatever
proposal she is getting and say yes to it. Mom, what do you mean by that? Do you think she can't get good proposals? No, I mean... See, she respects her mother
and brother Azmat so much. I just wanted that she gets
married in front of them. She can work and do her MBA
even after she gets married. Mom, since when have you started
thinking like those old school aunties? Besides, I can't discuss
such boring topics. Forget it. Tell me one thing. I hope you aren't getting married
under any pressure or something? I don't want to pressurize you in any way. You can take
all the time you need to think. Mom, when I was delaying
then you were in a hurry, And now that I'm ready...
Why are you afraid? Dear, the most difficult time for
a mother is to fix her marriage. And I think I am anxious about that only. Mom, I am confident about
Daniyal, and I really like him. And when the marriage
is fixed then why not him. I think he is the best option. Thank God. I am relieved that you aren't getting
married because I pressurized you. Mom, If I were under pressure I wouldn't
have rejected 400 other boys before this. Right! let me call them. Mom, what is it?
Did you want anything? Can't I sit with my son without
wanting anything from him? Of course you can. Tell me, how is you exam preparation going? What kind of a question is this?
I'm not in school any more. Okay, then talk about something else. Like what? That friend of your, Kinza,
what's up with her? She is just a friend,
what's wrong with you? It's okay, I'm your mother, tell me. Yes, our friendship just ended. -But why?
-No specific reason, it just ended. Zaid, I have felt since past few days that you have been trying
to avoid me. Are you angry? No, it's nothing like that.
I was just a bit busy. Are you sure you aren't angry? Look, Zaid, everyone is effected with whatever has been
going on since past few days in this house. And obviously Nosheen is
the most effected one with all of it. She is broken from inside, Zaid. You can't even imagine. Zaid, I know that you're angry with me,
and you don't even want to look at Nosheen. -I'm not angry with you.
-And what about Nosheen? I've forgiven her. The way you said it shows that
you haven't truly forgiven her. Mom, it doesn't even matter, honestly. Whether I forgive Nosheen or not, if it
doesn't make any difference to her then... No, dear, she... Mom, if that's what you want to talk about
then please, I have better things to do. Because of this attitude of yours,
our family is suffering the most, that no one from outside, be it anyone,
doesn't need to conspire against us. We have become so hollow from within. Mom, nobody is conspiring against us. Nosheen has done as bad with
this family as it could have been done. And honestly, I have no interest
in discussing this matter anymore. Aima, dear. where have you been since yesterday? You just gave me my
medicine, didn't even sit with me. Is everything all right? Yes, mom, everything is fine.
It's just that Zaid had fever. So I spent all day with him. And you know how Zaid behaves
like a kid when he has got fever. Yes, I too went to ask how he was. I just got free with my
own stuff a while ago so... I was busy earlier. No problem. How is Zaid feeling now? He better now. What is it, mom?
You wanted to say something? Yes. I want to say something but
don't understand how to ask you. Mom, what is it that you have to think
about so much before talking to me about it? Dear, there are many things
that aren't easy to ask for. May I ask what is it about? Obviously it is about you, your life. Whatever it is, you can
ask me without hesitation. Your education is completed. And now you are going
to start work in brother's office too. I want you to get married while I am alive. I don't understand if I should
ask this question from you or not. But before I take any
decision about your life, I want to ask you that do you have any plan about your life? What sort of plan, mom? Anything that you have in
mind, that you want to do. You can tell me. I have no such plans, mom. And I have always wanted that you and
dad take these decisions of my life for me. I knew it that this is
going to be your answer. Dear, is there someone you like? If me and brother choose a guy for you,
would you have any objection? Not at all, mom. Even I can't take a better
decision for me than you and dad can do. Aima, I'm proud of you. Actually, dad has chosen a boy for you. Really? Yes, I don't know who he is, but my heart
tells me that he has chosen Zaid for you. What mother said, is that true? I give up hope every time
and then get hopeful again. Oh, God, if this is a dream
then please keep me sleeping. Because it's more
beautiful than the reality. And if it is reality then please don't separate me and Zaid
even in my dreams. I think about it and wonder, that a person's life is
full of ups and downs, highs and lows. At times it seems
as if nothing is going to change. and sometimes one's life is
changed in a single moment. My God, it's only You who can do all this. Everything is in Your hands. You provide this broken, hopeless person
from a source and in such a way that he hasn't even imagined
getting it in such a way. Whenever Zaid starts liking a new girl I always feel that he can never be mine. But what did I know that You
are going to unite us this way where dad is going to ask mother
my hand in marriage himself for Zaid. But until this dream
becomes a complete reality, I wan to stay in disbelief. Nosheen, what have you
thought about your life dear? What do you plan to do further? What can I do, Mama?
What is left there in my life  besides chilling, and I'm doing that. Nosheen, my dear, you watch
movie all night, and sleep all day long. This isn't life. Do something, learn something new. I am learning , Mama.
I watch criminal movies and I'm trying to learn how
to fetch fugitive criminals. Nosheen, please. All of it is useless,
my child. You're wasting your time. Nosheen all of it is unachievable. Whatever you have studied
is going to get rusted too. -What shall I do then?
-Do some course. Which course? Any cooking course, or some baking course? You know it, Mama, that I start feeling bad
even by listening to the name of cooking. I have zero interest in it. Nosheen, my child,
what are you interested in then? You are zero in studies,
you don't know any work. Why don't you do some cooking
or computer related course? At least don't sit idle like that. And what do you think?
Would dad allow me to get out of the house? You just prepare yourself
and leave the rest to me. Listen to me, Nosheen. Look, if you take a computer
related course or a language course, then I will get your studies
continued as well from next year. Means I have to start studies again? Stop it, Nosheen. I'm saying
this for your own betterment. If you'll learn it will be
useful for you in future, and education is
really important for girls, Nosheen. Look, you are at ease right now because
you have your father's money to spend. If something bad happens tomorrow, this
degree is going to be useful for you, Nosheen. Please, take it seriously. There are girls who even work along
with their studies, and here you are... What is wrong with you, Mama? And we will take care of
what happens tomorrow later. Nosheen, please. If you won't do
anything and keep sitting idle like this,  you are going to stay uneducated. What is wrong, Mama? It hasn't been
even five days since I have returned home. These five days will turn
to five years and you won't even realize. Five years, it's a long time.
A lot of things will change. Nosheen, if you mean that you will
be married withing these five years then get rid of this thought. Because the things going on around
you regarding your proposal and marriage, I don't think that's ever
going to be possible. -Even then...
-Mama, you are underestimating Nosheen once again. For God's sake, please,
don't do something new, just try to prove that
you can get married still. Whatever, please go from here now. Nosheen, please
take whatever I'm saying seriously. I'm saying all this for your betterment. Hey, Shabana, come sit. If you're busy, I can come later. No, no, this keeps going on, you carry on. I wanted to tell you that
the medicine that doctor changed, I can't find it here. I sent the driver but he said that
we can get it from the main market. Oh, the driver called me to tell this. And I forgot it. I'll ask Zaid, he will get it right now. No, brother, he will have to go so far away, Besides I have to take
a tablet after every two days. And I have taken one yesterday. Okay then I'll get it
myself. It's in my way. I'll get the medicines tomorrow. Okay, brother. By the way, if you need something
you should ask Zaid without hesitation. Don't try to save him every time
or else he will become an idler. No, brother. May God
save him from evil eye. Zaid is very obedient.
He never says no to me. He has become very responsible.
Exactly the way I wanted him to be. Brother, I had to talk
to you, but right now... Yeah, go ahead. I'm listening. I don't understand how to ask you. I know what you're trying to ask, Shabana. You are thinking absolutely right,
I was signaling about that. As soon as I get a chance,
I'll talk to him. Yes, but actually I'm worried because would Zaid also agree to this proposal? I hope so. But don't worry, I don't want to impose my decisions
on my children, I hope you understand. Yes, brother. I have complete trust
on Zaid, he won't let me down. My younger son
is not like my elder son at all. So he would prefer my
happiness over his willingness. -Everything is going to be fine with God's will.
-With God's will. I have to finish a little work
and then we will talk, okay? Okay. I really love you a lot. In fact, I am crazy in your love. And it's good that you confessed. You eased my difficulty. I love you, Zoya. I love you too, Zaid. Aima, they are coming this
weekend and I've got nothing to wear. Oh, God, Zoya, you've got
so many clothes to wear. Do one thing, wear the golden one that you
wore at the welcome party at university. Me wearing an old dress?
No way, I need to buy a new one. My in laws are going to visit
and I'll wear an old dress? Zaid's calling me, I'll talk to you later. Just ignore him, he does that all the time.
Just listen to me. You'll have to stay these
coming two days with me. You are coming to the mall
and parlor with me, okay? Don't worry about me,
I'm going to stay with you. This guy is so impatient,
he is calling me now too. -Wait, let me add him in the call.
-Okay. Yeah, what is it, Zaid? No greetings, nothing, what happened? -Is Aima on call too?
-Yeah. That's great. Tell me why you've called? Listen to me carefully. I have something really
important to talk about with you two. Yeah, go ahead, we are listening. No, Zoya, not over the phone.
I need to talk face to face. Zaid, is everything all right? I don't know man,
but it's very important, it's very urgent. Zaid, we were having
an important conversation right now too. Zoya, the thing I want to talk about is
more important than any of your thing. Really? Means even more
important than my date fixing? Yes, it's even more important
than that. Very important. -Is everything okay?
-Yeah, Zaid you sound strange too. That's why I'm saying, we need to talk. Zoya, please come quick.
-Zaid it's 9:00 pm. Why don't you come here with Aima? All right, all right, I'm coming. -What's up with him now?
-This guy is a pain in the head. He just needs a chance to create a scene.
Attention seeker. It seems something serious. Do one thing, come here with him first. -Okay, bye.
-Bye. Good bye. What's wrong with him?
