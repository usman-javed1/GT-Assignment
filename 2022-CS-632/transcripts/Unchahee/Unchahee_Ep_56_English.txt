From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned to chirp from you Congratulations to you too. May
God give good fate to our kids. Please carry on, I'll be right back. People have such dads who
forgive their children's mistakes. And here my dad, he isn't even
happy for me on such a big news. He will only be happy when I'll die. Were you doing anything important? No. I hope I didn't disturb you. Now what does that mean? Oh, I think they didn't tell you anything. what didn't they tell me? Well, let me tell you then. Zoya has told them that she will continue her pregnancy
only when Zaid gives you a divorce. Faiq. Hello. Where are you Faiq? You left so early?
Why didn't you wake me up? Okay, fine. Oh, God! What shall I do with
this Faisal? How do I get rid of him? Faisal is going to ruin my
life, what shall I do about him? Go to hell you cheap person. Faisal, listen to me carefully... Hey, no greetings, nothing? Is
this how one treats their friends? Faisal, I'm going to give
your number to the police if you call me even one more time. Okay, first think clearly, will you give it to the police
or to the cyber crime branch? By the way, I'm really scared of
the cyber crime people. Honestly. Stop this nonsense, Faisal,
and listen to me. What is wrong? Why are
you so angry early morning? Faisal, what do you think? Am I
going to still get blackmailed by you? Look, I didn't say anything like that. Do one thing, tell anyone
anything you want to. I am not going to be
intimidated by your threats, got it? I can understand anything you say. It's just you who don't
understand anything I say. What is it that you can do?
You can tell my husband at most? Call him right now
and tell him everything. And then wait for what
I am going to do to you. Nosheen, I'm actually scared of you
today. Why are you doing this to me? You think I am only threatening you? I'll tell everything to Faiq myself. Will you tell him everything? Let's do one thing. You tell
him a little and I'll tell him the rest. And yes, tell him how you
spoiled you poor cousin's life. And what places did you go
with me and what did you do. I know you won't be able to
tell all that, you will need my help. Okay then, I'll share those
pictures and all, simple. I wish he dies. What should I do? Whom shall I tell?
Hammad or Zaid? No, this might make things worse. ad, might get to know about it. Maybe he is just threatening
me and doesn't do anything. No, I shouldn't tell anyone. Strange, you are still  doing fine? I didn't get you, auntie. Oh, I think they didn't tell you anything. what didn't they tell me? Well, let me tell you then. Zoya has told them that she will continue her pregnancy
only when Zaid gives you a divorce. I have reached to this conclusion
after thinking a lot over it. I only wanted to do it
because I want some peace. I'm fed up. But, please, don't ever
think that I'm leaving you. Why would I think that?
Besides, it's your right. No, Aima, neither I'm
leaving you nor mom and dad. You should have called
before coming, Faiq. I know, but it was no use calling you because
you wouldn't have attended my call. -I was busy.
-I know. That's why I thought of
coming here without calling you. You might take out some time for me. -Faiq I...
-I know, Sania. You're angry with me because of Nosheen. I didn't mind much what
Nosheen said the other day, as much I disliked what you said. Sania, I say sorry to you for that too. You know, because of guys
like you we girls get infamous. If you guys keep clear intentions
while starting a friendship then no girl would doubt
her husband like this. Sania, I don't have any wrong intentions. You're my friend,
and I like you as a friend. I never think wrong about you, but it's true that I like
to spend time with you. Is this something that
is acceptable for a wife? Answer me. I don't know, but I
have told you how I feel. Trust me, Sania, I have
got good intentions for you. Who is going to explain this to Nosheen? I have already told her that you
are just a good friend, that's it. Really? And what was her response? What else? She asked me to swear
upon our unborn child, and I swore. Congratulations. Thank you. I hope that whatever conflicts
there are between you two, they end. Even I hope so too, Sania. But I don't have those feelings for
Nosheen that a husband has for her wife. These are the things
which confuse me, Faiq. Why do you tell me all this? Because I consider you as a good friend. This is something that concerns your wife, and these things are so personal that you
shouldn't even tell this to your friend. What's wrong with that? I don't want to argue with
you on this issue anymore. If there is something I can
do for you then go ahead, otherwise, you can go from here. Actually, Sania, I came
here to give you this check. You weren't attending my calls, how could
have I told you that your check is ready? Thanks. It's your hard earned money,
no need to thank me for it? But still. Anyway, tell me how
are auntie and Nosheen doing? They both are doing fine. Oh, by they way, -I remember, I forgot to tell you.
-What? Your friend, Salman, he doesn't
talk to me in a sarcastic way now. -Good, that's nice.
-I'm sure, you must have asked him. Yeah, I just explained him once. -Do you want some tea?
-No, thank you. I'll leave now. Faiq, Yeah, what is it? If you disliked anything
that I said, then I'm sorry. No, Sania, it's okay. In fact, I'd like to request you something. Sure, what is it? Sania, can we meet occasionally? Like we used to? Just like a friend, that's it. Okay. Thank you, thank you so much. I'll go now, bye. -Faisal, you here?
-Yeah how did you like my surprise? Have you lost your mind?
Why have you come here? My mind is perfectly fine.
As in excellent. Get lost from here. Who is that, your mother in law? What do you have to do it, be it
anyone. Just get lost from here. How can I go like that? I've come to meet
you, I can't leave without talking to you. -Faisal, go from here, or else..
-Or else? That is my dialogue. Nosheen! Yeah, auntie, I'm coming. Faisal, please leave. Oh, this was the face I
wanted to see, I was missing it. You have blocked me from everywhere. That's why I had t come here. How can you block me from here? -Faisal, go away from here, I say go away.
-Nosheen, who is it? -Greetings, auntie. I'm Faisal.
-Greetings. Oh, are you here to meet Faiq? No, no. Nosheen, won't
you introduce me to auntie? Auntie, actually, he is my... We were together in college,
we're very good friends. Okay. I didn't know where she
vanished after college. She got married. I met
friend who told em about her. So, I thought of meeting her today. Yes, auntie, we were in the same college. We have spent a lot of time together. Look at her how she is treating me. She didn't even ask me to
come inside even formally. No, no, please come in. Nosheen
go take him, I'll ask them to make tea. No, auntie, he just told me that
he came to met just for a while. He has no plans to sit down. No, auntie, thank you so much. I
just came to meet her for a while. I'll definitely stay longer
when I visit next time. Okay, then, Nosheen shut the gate properly
before coming in, I'm calling my auntie. What was that? I'm going to kill you! You will have to meet
me even for that, my love. Keep it low! Tell me what do you want.
Why aren't you leaving me alone? You know very well what I want. And yes, attend my calls. Otherwise, I might have to
meet your husband next time. Okay, go from here right now, please. -First unblock my number.
-I will, now go from here. Okay then, talk to me over the phone. Hurry, go now. Why isn't this boy picking up? Zaid. -Greetings, Dad.
-Greetings. Where have you been? Noting, I just went to a friend. I have been calling you for so
long and you weren't picking up. Were you? I'm sorry. Actually, Dad, my phone was on
silent mode. I didn't notice you calling. No problem. Did you want anything? No I didn't, I was just
checking up on you. What is it? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. I saw, I saw that Zoya is back. It felt good looking at her coming back. So, did you talk to her? Talk about what, Dad? Oh, okay. No, I haven't talked to her,
but don't worry, she'll agree. I wish that it's better that you
talk to her, and clear things up. Okay, Dad, I'll do it. Why are you getting worried? No, I... -was just thinking about something.
-What's that? Didn't I tell you? Hammad only came to the
hospital because he thought I died. Or about to die. So, it would be better that he apologized. But now, he is not
bothered if we live or die. -It's not like that, Dad.
-What else can it be then, that he came once and then he didn't
bother to look back and just vanished? -Dad, Hammad isn't here.
-What do you me he isn't here? Actually, he has gone
out of country for his work. And I'm sure, as soon as
he returns he will visit home. Who told you that he is out of country? I talked to him myself. Okay. All right, if you say I believe
you that he will return. You know, when do I like kids the most? When the crawl. Actually, I don't like kids that much but it makes me so excited to think that
I, I mean we are going to have a child. -Faiq.
-Yes? Are you busy? Yeah, a little. You carry on. Faiq, can't you stop your
messaging and talk to me for a while? Nosheen, what is so important
that you want all my attention? Faiq, I have to go to the doctor's
tomorrow, will you take me? What time? 2:00 pm? Nosheen, I'm a little busy at 2:00,
you can go with mom. What are you saying? It's not auntie's but your responsibility
to take me to visit the doctor. I know, Nosheen. If you do then you should come with me. This is our first child,
we should be together. Why do you create such a
big issue on such a petty thing? When did I make an issue?
I just want you to come with me. And what are you so busy with
that you can't come with me tomorrow? Nosheen, why do you make
an issue out of everything? When I've told you to go with mom, I'll
send the car what is your problem then? I have an issue. The doctor is going to do my ultrasound
tomorrow and I want you to be with me. Okay, I'll be there. Oh, I was thinking that my
daughter is sleeping all day today. Half of the days has passed. No, auntie, I wasn't sleeping.
I am up since morning. Why didn't you come out
and have breakfast with me? I don't feel like it. Are you feeling okay, Nosheen? Did something between you and Faiq happen? No. What kind of a no is this
which includes a yes too? Auntie, your son hates me. What is wrong? Did you
both had a fight again? I am going to scold him a lot this
time, why does he tease my daughter? Now, tell me what's wrong? I'm telling you, Faiq
doesn't love me anymore. He is regretting getting married to me. What? Has he said that to you? -He hasn't said it.
-Why are you thinking like that, Nosheen? It's obvious through
his tone, his attitude. Nosheen, at times the
things we are feeling or what we think is true is all false. But it can be true too. Yes, it can be, but I don't
there anything like that. And lets say if it is like that, then don't worry, all this will
be settled once the baby is born. because you both will be so busy
that you won't even remember all this. Believe me, he is going to fill
the gap between you two with his love. Do you actually think that? Yes, I'm telling this
through my experience. Just stay happy, okay? Okay, now get up and eat something, okay? I have already told you, she has no
manners how to talk. She is ill mannered. It's okay, Faiq. I think she has a right. -Right? What right?
-She is your wife. And if she doesn't like
my presence in your life then I think you
shouldn't meet me. What are you saying? No one can disrespect you. And it's not Nosheen's right. Rather it's your greatness
that you stood quiet that day. Faiq, I'm tired of
listening to such bitterness. This is how people think
about divorced women. Please Sania, don't embarrass me anymore.
I know you very well. You have very negative
thoughts about wives. I don't know if it is your personal
experience or your observation, but whatever it is, it is a little harsh. Maybe you're right, Sania, but I... No, Faiq, no ifs and buts. It is important for your relationship with
her that you don't stay in touch with me. Which relation, Sania? What relation? -What do you mean by that?
-I don't mean anything, I just know that my mind isn't
coherent with Nosheen's at all. I don't feel good when I'm with her. You know, she is 
a cunning and selfish girl. But yo told me yourself that
you had chosen her yourself. I did, but a person can
commit a mistake too. And, by the way, I am not
satisfied by this marriage. I mean, don't take me wrong, I can't end my friendship with you. How did you think of
your auntie today, Zaid? -Greetings, auntie.
-Greetings. How are you doing? I'm okay. What brought you here? 
Why didn't you bring Zoya with you? Auntie, actually I wanted to talk to you
in private that's why I didn't bring her. Oh! Go ahead, what do you want to say? But please, don't say
anything which is of no use. Oh, means you were about to say
something which I don't want to listen. I don't know if this is important
for you or not but for me it is. Okay, I'm listening, what is it? Ask Zoya to stop being stubborn.
I can't divorce Aima. She isn't being stubborn, 
it's her demand, Zaid. She is only going to stay with
you when you will divorce Aima. -What if I don't do that?
-Up to you. You can forget about Zoya 
and your kid then. -Are you threatening me?
-You can think of it whatever you like. But Zoya is not going to
change her decision now. My daughter has suffered a lot. 
She is my only daughter. And I won't let her make 
a compromise of any sort. Where there is no compromise
in a relation that relation breaks off. I don't care. When one has to compromise in a relationship
it is better that it breaks off. If you can be so sensitive
about your daughter, can't I be possessive
about my unborn child? Really? What can you do if Zoya
doesn't want him to bring in this world? If that's the case then be it like that. I am going to go to any
extent to get my child. Even if I have to file 
a case on you and Zoya. Fine, let it be. Do whatever you can, 
and Zoya will do whatever she wants. I had informed Faiq, 
if he comes I'll go with him. Otherwise, I'll go myself. Why will you go alone? Go with Faiq. And if he gets stuck in dome
work then I'll go with you. Forget it, auntie, 
I know what is he busy with. Since when you are
tolerating his blackmailing? And why didn't you tell me before? Actually, I got scared that if I tell something to
someone, things might get worse. -You're mad.
-I just got scared. Doesn't matter if anyone
knows about it or not, I'm going to tell everyone that all this
is a drama and I'm not going to be a mom. What did you get me into, Mom? Actually, after telling all this at least
I am going to take the burden off me. Why were you doing it? What is wrong? 
What is it, just listen to me.
