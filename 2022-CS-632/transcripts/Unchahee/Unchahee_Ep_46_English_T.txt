[0.00] From flowers and from buds
[4.57] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.16] When I saw you
[14.30] I learned to chirp from you
[19.10] Okay, hold on.
[23.57] Mom and me were waiting
for you over dinner.
[29.16] Okay, you guys start, I'll join you.
[33.86] Look, Zaid, it's very simple.
[36.32] Just tell me who do you want
in your life. Aima or me?
[41.05] And if you can't leave Aima
then you should divorce me.
[45.20] For God's sake, tell them to
have some mercy on my daughter.
[50.65] Yes, of course sister, now
that you have talked to me
[54.45] I will talk to sister
Nimra about it for sure.
[56.66] And if necessary I will talk to Faiq too.
[59.65] Nosheen, trust me dear.
[62.23] Don't you dare call me dear.
I am not dear to you.
[78.88] Will you just stop being sarcastic?
[84.12] Can't we sit and talk like normal people?
[87.02] Really? Is everything
normal like it used to be?
[92.40] It's only things like these
that you say which hurt me.
[94.75] Of course it's only
what I say that hurts you.
[99.62] That's why you go to Aima to vent out.
[103.52] It's nothing like that, Zoya.
[107.12] Having a good time?
[109.91] Don't you lie to me, Zaid.
[114.19] And I'm sorry I ruined
your moment with her.
[121.21] It seemed as if you are on a honeymoon
flight and I have come like bad weather.
[127.43] You think I was lying?
[130.18] When did I say that?
[131.60] Zoya if you have even a little doubt,
you may inquire at the airline office.
[136.44] Right, like this is the only thing
I have to do to keep inquiring.
[144.65] Relax. No need to get
tensed on such small things.
[151.57] And okay, I believe that
you are telling the truth.
[155.21] You have never lied, you are too truthful.
[160.09] What is this mark on your hand?
[164.36] Don't you know?
[167.02] -I don't know.
-It's a gift from you, Zaid.
[174.49] You are responsible
for my every agony, Zaid.
[179.77] This is a wound that is visible to you.
[182.62] There are many wounds
that aren't visible to you.
[190.27] Anyway, I asked you to take a decision.
[195.58] what have you decided?
[203.12] I have decided.
[208.44] I have decided that I can't leave Aima.
[222.69] Now think of it as my
compulsion or whatever.
[225.14] But that's the truth.
[231.26] This means that you
are going to divorce me?
[233.42] -No, Zoya, I can't even think about it.
-Then what do you want?
[239.67] I want to carry on with both the relationships.
[243.68] This is what you want, Zaid.
[247.62] Not me.
[248.73] Besides, I asked you to
choose among only two options.
[254.44] Not to bring in a third option.
[256.94] Try to understand,
Zoya, I can't do anything.
[259.82] Okay, I will let mom know then.
Till then let me pack my stuff.
[264.79] Move.
[265.84] Zoya, for God's sake.
[268.72] Instead of understanding my compulsion
you are threatening me on everything.
[272.69] I am not threatening you , Zaid. I
am just expressing my intentions.
[277.15] Zoya, please don't be so cruel with me.
[279.62] Of course, I am the one
who has done all the cruelty.
[282.89] You can live your life
happily when I leave.
[286.89] I don't want this at all,
Zoya, I swear I love you!
[290.43] Stop it, Zaid.
[291.74] And don't you say stupid
things like love and all to me.
[295.00] These techniques are obsolete now.
[300.24] Okay.
[306.27] I think you don't want to
understand my problem.
[310.21] Problem?
[312.55] What do you mean?
[314.04] Why are you pretending
to be so helpless?
[316.04] If you can get married when you were
forced to, why can;t you give divorce then?
[319.49] Besides, I am asking you to use your right.
[325.08] I am not asking you to murder her.
[329.36] Zoya, it is not necessary that
a person uses his every right.
[332.81] And have I ever deprived
you of any of your rights?
[336.12] Have I ever tried to
hurt you intentionally?
[338.52] Tell me.
[339.67] No, not at all. You have
given me all my rights.
[345.65] It's just that you have imposed
your second wife on me.
[348.76] That's not injustice, right?
[351.59] Zaid,
[354.09] just let me know one thing.
[358.54] Are you in love with Aima?
[365.23] She is just a compulsion for you, right?
[372.15] Hmm.
[374.62] What hmm?
[377.13] Answer me.
[380.11] Do you love Aima or me?
[383.05] What kind of a question is this, Zoya?
Of course I love you.
[386.34] Why don't you just leave her then?
[388.91] Zaid, it's really difficult for me.
I can't share you with anyone.
[395.54] Besides, seeing your husband with
someone else everyday isn't that easy.
[402.12] And I admit that you
both needed each other,
[406.99] and whenever you needed
something you asked Aima for it.
[411.50] I was never the one you needed.
[414.43] But now,
[416.97] I want that she doesn't
remain someone you need.
[419.88] She isn't the one I need, Zoya,
she is just my compulsion, I swear.
[427.38] I can't leave her.
[433.43] Please try to understand.
I live in dad's house.
[436.58] Only his rules are followed
here, I can't go against it.
[440.66] And Zoya, if I talk to her pleasantly
for a few minutes everyday,
[445.39] what difference would it make to you?
[447.08] You know, dad is noticing everything.
[450.88] He will just get a little satisfaction.
[458.13] Why are you smiling?
[460.73] Wow, even supreme court would
give in, in front of your excuses.
[466.11] These are not excuses, Zoya, I am telling you the truth.
[470.59] There are no two opinions about it.
[472.61] And it's true that you live in your
dad's house, you work for his business.
[478.64] And looks like you only
follow what he tells you to.
[485.17] And only he will tell you
[488.58] how many marriages
you are supposed to have,
[489.90] how to treat whom,
how to make her happy.
[492.67] You don't have any decisions of your own.
[495.58] Zoya, whatever I do, I do in dad's respect.
[498.96] And I would expect you also that
being my wife you respect him too.
[503.17] I do respect him, Zaid.
[505.87] But you know what the problem is?
[508.73] I am not dependent on him.
[510.90] That's why I won't give
the control of my life in his hands.
[514.59] And as far as you and
your problem is concerned,
[517.77] I have a solution for that.
[520.26] Leave Aima and your dad's house.
[524.92] Zaid, I will talk to mom, she will arrange
for your job and house, everything.
[535.86] Are you serious, Zoya? What
the hell are you talking about?
[538.71] I knew it that you won't
like this option either.
[553.51] You know why, Zaid?
[555.24] Because you are a weak person.
[559.88] You can't take your own decisions.
[562.50] And the decisions you are unable
to take you blame it on your dad.
[570.02] Actually, you know what?
You are happy here.
[577.20] I just have one regret, Zaid.
That I loved a person like you.
[588.25] You are a coward.
[598.49] You stay with them.
[600.70] I won't stay.
[671.02] -Greetings, Mom.
-Greetings.
[674.66] -My son is looking so nice, where are you headed?
-Thanks.
[678.42] I has to meet a friend, and as I was
home today so thought of meeting him.
[682.41] In fact that's the reason
why I took the day off.
[685.16] Very good, you know meeting
friends releases stress too.
[690.72] Yeah, that's true.
[692.14] Tell me one thing,
[693.84] I have been noticing for a few days
that you don't take Nosheen any where.
[697.22] What do you mean? Where?
[699.70] For shopping or for eating out.
[702.73] Mom, I had spoiled her in the beginning when
I used to take her out every now and then.
[706.16] Let her get back to her senses now.
[708.24] Very bad, Faiq. She is your wife.
[710.97] And it's your duty to make her happy.
[713.81] I know, but the truth is
that she doesn't deserve it.
[719.52] No matter how much I do,
it's never enough for her.
[722.27] To adjust just the girl
doesn't need to make efforts only.
[728.19] In fact the boy and his
family need to adjust too.
[733.99] If any one of them gets stubborn
then the relationship doesn't last.
[737.98] Mom, I try my best but she is
a quarrelsome and ill mannered girl.
[745.93] When you had made this
decision I had an idea even then
[750.06] that you are going to face
a lot of problems in future.
[755.68] Because this glitz and glam doesn't
keep one attracted for much longer.
[759.71] In the end the only girl who is
likeable is the one who has got skills.
[763.78] Mom, let bygones be bygones.
[767.18] I am saying all this to you
[769.77] because be this girl quarrelsome,
ill-mannered or unskilled,
[775.66] you will have to spend
your life with her now.
[779.09] I don't know how am I going to spend it.
[783.15] Wow, what a way to explain your son.
[786.48] I am really impressed.
[787.98] Everyone should have
a mother in law like you.
[790.36] You are fueling up your
son and then telling him
[792.53] that he will have to
spend his life with me?
[800.09] Oh, sorry, I think I disturbed you guys.
[812.39] Anyway, I'm going to mama's house.
[815.24] You aren't going anywhere.
[818.08] Stay home.
[819.17] Don't know what is it there
that you go there everyday.
[822.27] Faiq.
[825.96] -You may go.
-But I am telling her not to.
[830.54] No need to go anywhere. Mom,
is alone at home, stay with her.
[837.68] No need to worry about me. Let her go,
[840.67] Well, it's not like she is chatting
and enjoying with me all day.
[849.77] That she will get lonely at home.
[852.22] Look no need to talk back to me. It's because
of mom that you are getting permission.
[859.18] Faiq, you are leaving, so why don't
you drop her to her mother’s place.
[865.07] Sorry, mother, I have to
pick my friend on my way.
[867.85] You may rent a cab or ask
your mom to send the driver.
[871.41] Please don't worry about how I
am going to go. I can manage.
[879.33] And by the way where are
you going all dressed up?
[882.74] Are you going to get married again?
[884.63] Just stop this nonsense, understood?
[888.92] What's wrong? I was just kidding.
[891.85] Aren't we even allowed
to joke in this house?
[894.31] One can expect only
such cheap jokes from you.
[897.25] Enough both of you. And you can go wherever
[934.36] Are you serious, Zoya? What
the hell are you talking about?
[937.26] I knew it that you won't
like this option either.
[941.53] You know why, Zaid?
[943.25] Because you are a weak person.
[951.05] You can't take your own decisions.
[953.78] And the decisions you are unable
to take you blame it on your dad.
[957.62] Actually, you know what?
You are happy here.
[987.56]  First tell me where have you been?
[990.64] when we moved here from Norway,
you used to attend my calls.
[992.99] And then you got married and after that
you were just vanished. No contact.
[996.45] What can I say? My life has been
really difficult from past few years.
[1001.68] Why what happened?
[1003.30] Well, the experience of
getting married didn't go well.
[1007.45] Oh, really?
[1011.02] We had issues since the beginning.
[1015.17] He used to stay idle at home all
day. We had quarrels on every thing.
[1019.19] Then I came to know that he takes drugs.
[1024.48] And then it got to the point
where he started hitting me.
[1030.09] Well, how did your family
got you married to that guy?
[1033.15] Didn't they do any investigation first?
[1034.90] Everything seems really
nice from a distance, Faiq.
[1037.57] He was well educated and quite rich too.
[1040.75] You know what the parents of a girl want.
[1044.00] You are right about that.
[1045.26] But the good thing is that I am
not in that relationship anymore.
[1049.86] Oh, that's great.
[1051.91] I was under depression after that, but then
I left for Germany for further studies.
[1059.12] I did my PhD and now
I am back to Pakistan.
[1063.14] By the way, it's so strange,
[1065.29] everyone wants to leave this place
and you left everything and got back here.
[1069.45] Well I am at peace only here.
Everything seemed so fake abroad.
[1074.68] So true.
[1075.92] After all you also came leaving
everything behind in Norway.
[1079.51] Yeah, I think we both
have similar motivation.
[1082.97] Yeah, right.
[1084.77] What else, how is life?
[1087.01] Well, just like a married man's life is.
[1090.71] -Really? And how is a married man's life?
-Boring.
[1095.44] Oh come on, you men are such drama queens.
[1101.19] Just a minute.
[1103.83] Oh, it's my wife.
[1106.64] So, pick it up.
[1108.89] No it mustn't be anything
important, I know.
[1112.31] -How can you be so sure?
-Because I get around 50 calls in a day.
[1117.59] From which 25 are of my wife's and
25 are of my restaurant’s manager.
[1124.71] By the way you know
who I met at my restaurant?
[1129.76] -Who?
-Make a guess.
[1133.99] Miss Farzana!
[1136.55] Oh! Miss Farzana, whom you guys
used to call Farzana the medical store.
[1143.16] Yeah, the same.
[1144.95] Really? How is she doing?
She must be quite aged now.
[1149.51] She is fine, and no she isn't
aged, in fact she got really fit.
[1154.57] Anyway, it's really nice meeting
you after such a long time.
[1159.34] Same here, and now please
stay in touch.
[1161.84] No excuses like I'm too busy and
then you vanish again.
[1165.63] Of course not, and you do the same, okay?
[1168.40] -Come let's take a selfie till the food arrives.
-Yeah sure.
[1179.28] Anyway, tell me what was the surprise
for which you came to my home?
[1182.29] Wow, you remembered it so soon.
[1184.84] Just tell me now.
[1188.16] Looks like you have gotten
back to your senses now.
[1192.08] Mama, will you tell me now or
just keep saying random things?
[1195.15] -I came to give you both some money.
-Money?
[1199.67] Well I'm not like Amber
who is aware of everything
[1203.15] and made all the arrangements herself.
[1205.23] That's why I brought some
money for your honey moon,
[1208.17] so that you both can decide
what to do and where to go.
[1212.42] Really? But Faiq didn't tell me that.
[1215.87] Are you both still mad at each other?
[1218.71] I don't know. I am not talking
to him properly these days.
[1223.22] Nosheen, when will
you stop being childish?
[1226.42] Anyway, come to the real topic.
[1227.91] What happened then?
Didn't Faiq take money from you?
[1230.33] Not at all.
[1232.52] He just backed off and said me rudely
what do you think I don't have any money?
[1239.20] What?
[1240.05] He returned me the envelope
and started to confront me.
[1244.46] I tried to tell him that it is a gift
and you should keep it as a gift
[1248.44] But then he started misbehaving.
[1251.18] All this is taught to him by that old lady.
[1253.97] Excuse me, Nosheen, but he seems
much more clever than your mother in law.
[1259.03] He doesn't listen to anyone.
[1262.34] By the way, Nosheen where
did you get yourself into?
[1264.37] He was about to destroy that Aima's fate.
[1267.50] and you came in between, just for nothing.
[1270.76] Mama, how would have I known
that he would turn out to be like this.
[1274.49] But don't you worry.
[1276.07] Let the time come, I will
give both of them tough time.
[1279.23] I would say just stay away from them.
[1282.06] Anyway, how much money did you bring?
[1285.19] It was 5,00,000/-
[1286.77] Do one thing, give that money to me.
[1289.76] I am going to take him
for the honeymoon for sure.
[1291.58] I will give it to you but
don't force him too much.
[1294.62] Tell me, is you mother in
law back to her senses yet?
[1299.43] Oh, no, Mama. Today she was saying
bad things about me right in front of me.
[1303.40] Really? Strange.
[1306.25] Anyway, do you know that your
sister in law came to my home?
[1308.70] Yeah, I sent her to talk to them.
[1311.10] I thought they are relatives,
[1313.49] if she talks to her she would start
using her brain, and get a little better.
[1317.73] Mama! I feel like mourning on your wisdom.
[1321.05] Now what?
[1322.46] Don't you understand
such a small thing
[1324.15] that even the friend of
an enemy is an enemy.
[1326.43] Don't know what she might
have said to my sister in law.
[1328.62] Nosheen, whatever one
does for you isn't enough.
[1332.76] Now handle these mother and son yourself.
[1352.05] This guy never picks up my call.
[1372.34] Nosheen, when did you get back?
[1375.54] It's been an hour since I
got back. You weren't home.
[1379.24] Yes, I went to check up on
a patient in the neighbors.
[1383.13] Well, do you see your son now?
[1386.73] What happened? Did anything
happen between you two again?
[1390.04] Anything can only happen
when he gets back home.
[1393.85] What? Isn't Faiq back yet?
[1397.41] No. He doesn't even
bother to answer my call now.
[1403.56] Why are you talking like this?
He is your husband.
[1407.78] Wow, even when it's your son's
fault you are still blaming me?
[1413.33] I am not blaming you, dear.
[1418.66] I am just telling you like a mother.
[1421.49] Really? What is it?
[1423.37] Try to talk sweetly.
[1428.80] And you will see that
the world is going to be yours.
[1432.43] Just leave it. Nothing effects your son.
[1437.44] You are right, if he had any
effect, he wouldn't have married you.
[1445.37] You should not keep so
many differences in your heart.
[1448.45] And don't forget that you
both had a love marriage.
[1451.97] Not me but maybe
your son has forgotten it.
[1455.85] Then remind him that.
[1457.98] All those nice things that
you said to each other.
[1461.62] And make new memories.
[1463.54] What memories shall I make with him?
Don't you know what he has done to my mama?
[1469.01] What? What has he done?
[1473.04] Don't you know? Mama came the other
day to send me and Faiq on honeymoon.
[1478.98] And Faiq misbehaved with him so
much. Don't you know about that?
[1484.52] I just don't understand what is
the problem between you two.
[1489.41] I don't know what is it
that you both fight over.
[1492.64] Some of it is because
of the fire that you ignited.
[1497.28] Please don't mind, auntie,
but it was your wish
[1503.53] that Aima and Faiq get married, 
but he got married to me.
[1510.78] That was my wish only. Besides what does
my wish has to do with your relationship?
[1516.98] It has to do with our relationship.
[1519.38] Faiq thinks that by marrying
me he has hurt his mom.
[1526.85] And he is behaving this way because
he think he has done wrong to you.
[1533.37] It's nothing like that, Nosheen.
[1537.80] Okay then how is it, you tell me?
[1540.94] I always tell him to stay happy
with you and keep you happy too.
[1546.97] I have heard it from my own ears now.
[1549.93] Weren't you telling Faiq that
I am ill mannered, an idler,
[1557.75] and now you will have to
spend your life with Nosheen.
[1565.34] What happened? Didn't you say that?
[1567.93] Therefore don't pretend
to be nice in front of me.
[1573.06] Believe me, I just wish
that my children stay happy.
[1579.19] You both sort your differences
and spend life happily together.
[1587.30] Okay, I believe you.
[1611.73] Faiq answer my call.
[1629.23] Madam has asked you to stay here,
she will come and talk to you herself.
[1641.11] -You took a while to come.
-Auntie, I wanted to come.
[1645.21] Why didn't you come then?
[1647.28] Auntie, I know that you
guys a re angry with me.
[1651.35] Please don't call me auntie.
[1653.89] Not with your mouth at least.
[1658.02] I'm, I'm sorry, auntie.
[1660.70] Sorry? that's it?
[1665.11] If I slit your throat and then
say sorry, would it be okay?
[1672.31] Zaid you loved my
daughter so much, didn't you?
[1675.88] You married her and took her from
here, with so much begging, pride and love.
[1684.82] What have you done then?
[1687.40] Why did you do this to my daughter?
[1689.65] Auntie, I'm really sorry.
[1693.26] That's not enough, Zaid.
[1697.41] Auntie, please try to understand. 
I had to do this.
[1701.65] Oh!
[1703.89] I haven't seen such an obedient son ever.
[1709.10] But you are a looser husband in my eyes.
[1714.96] I did a huge mistake by
getting Zoya married to you.
[1719.32] -Auntie please, I need to talk to Zoya.
-Out of question.
[1723.38] You will answer me before Zoya.
[1726.67] Look, please, call Zoya.
[1729.53] No, Zaid, she won't talk to you.
[1733.59] She is my wife, I have
full right to talk to her.
[1736.77] Oh, so now you remember your rights?
[1741.82] And duties?
[1744.17] What about your duties?
[1748.91] Go away from here.
[1751.44] I think it would be better that
you let me meet with Zoya.
[1755.41] No, Zaid, you have
already hurt her too much.
[1765.64] I was thinking of going to lunch
tomorrow after our presentation.
[1771.33] No, I won't be coming to office tomorrow.
[1774.68] Aima, is everything all right?
[1777.58] I tried to talk sweetly with
your son on your advice.
[1782.06] Then?
[1783.31] Then what? He thinks
of himself as something.
[1786.23] He is so proud.
[1788.52] -Rather do one thing. You want money?
-Yeah.
[1791.61] Then go and jump off a roof.
[1794.63] I promise I will pay for your shroud. 
You won't die like you don't have anyone.
[1798.42] Just try and die once.
[1800.48] Well, I am not going to die so easily.
[1805.33] And if I die, I will cause 
many others to die with me.
[1808.81] What do you mean?
[1810.01] You are wise enough to
understand what I'm saying.
[1814.23] You will get fever. Wear this.
[1820.93] You are just...
[1822.99] Oh, I'm so sorry guys. 
I didn't want to disturb you both.
[1829.49] No, Zoya, it's nothing like
what you think, we were just...
[1834.66] talking.
[1835.89] It is like that, Zaid. Besides there
was such a nice romance going on
[1840.49] and I spoiled it for no reason.
