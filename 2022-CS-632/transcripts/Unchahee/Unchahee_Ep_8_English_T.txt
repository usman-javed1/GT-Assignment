[0.11] From flowers and from buds
[4.67] I have learnt to bloom and be fragrant
[9.37] When I saw you
[14.21] I learned how to chirp from you
[19.04] I just don't understand
what Zaid saw in Kinza.
[23.38] Was she the only one to fall
 in love with? I detest her.
[28.34] Don't know what she saw in her.
[30.27] Zoya, I can't say
anything about this.
[32.99] You are allowing the proposals
coming through dad too
[35.18] and you have asked auntie
for my proposals as well.
[39.95] Boys can do whatever they want, and girls
should stay confined in the house?
[46.04] Don't you start this
useless argument with me.
[48.96] No, not so easily, brother.
Tell me, why are men so dual-faced?
[63.58] By the way, this teddy bear of yours
must belong to a really good family,
[68.52] that she is calling you at this
hour of this night.
[70.66] Just get lost, go, get out of my room.
[81.80] Hi, Kinza, how are you doing?
[85.11] No, it's nothing.
So what were we talking about?
[90.47] Yeah, right, tomorrow's plan.
[154.48] Good morning. Till when are
you not going to talk to me?
[161.15] Who is that?
[170.54] -Hello.
-Thank you for calling me.
[174.22] May I know who you are, and
why are you bothering me?
[178.44] That would be really nice if
we get to know each other.
[181.21] And I really don't intend to bother you.
[184.21] Excuse me? Where did you
get my number from?
[187.10] Getting a number is not a difficult job.
[190.18] If you really devoted
then it's easier to achieve your destiny.
[192.85] You seem like a really cheap person.
[195.20] I am not a bad guy, Aima.
I just want to be friends with you.
[199.54] Look, I don't want to
be friends with anyone.
[202.21] And please, stop bothering me. Or else
I am going to treat you really bad.
[206.38] Don't hang up, please.
Just listen to me first.
[209.57] I would like to meet you once, just once.
[212.11] Look mister, neither do I want to meet
you, nor I want to be friends with you.
[216.69] -So just stop teasing me.
-Aima, listen to me...
[220.87] I am going to block him right away.
[224.82] It's too late.
[232.42] -Greetings, aunt.
-Greetings, dear.
[236.19] -Bless you.
-I have brought your medicines.
[239.46] Bless you, son.
[241.74] Is everything all right? I thought
you went to university with Aima.
[246.59] No I had to take an off today,
[248.49] actually some guy's family
is coming to meet Nosheen.
[253.22] -Didn't you know about it?
-Know, I didn't.
[261.18] Brother must have forgotten to tell me.
[265.47] May she have a great life ahead.
[269.59] I told Aima that I will
drop her to the university.
[274.50] And she left without waking me up.
[276.35] I wonder, she never does like that.
[280.60] Exactly, that's what I was thinking.
[282.84] I don't know, she has been really weird
 since past few days.
[286.11] She says things that
don't make sense,
[288.00] and if I ask what it is wrong
she starts crying.
[290.23] It's just that,
she is a really sensitive girl.
[298.87] Her heart melts easily.
[302.06] I just wish that she doesn't
have to face any more problems,
[309.81] and if there is any problem,
then may God give that to me.
[316.35] What are you talking about, aunt?
Why would anyone hurt you or Aima?
[321.01] I don't have the answer to this "Why?".
[326.18] But...
[329.47] I don't know what pleasure
people get by hurting others.
[338.92] Don't worry, me and dad are there for you.
[341.55] And if God wills, we will never
let any problem near you.
[346.16] Bless you my son.
[349.53] That's what I expect from you.
[355.01] May God give you lots
and lots of happiness.
[359.68] -Amen.
-Amen.
[364.12] Okay, now you take rest,
I'm just going to go.
[366.10] All right, son.
[372.21] Look at him, I am finally
going to meet him.
[374.77] Meet who?
[376.62] -The date that mom has arranged.
-Oh, good luck.
[383.38] Oh, God!
[386.89] This is the same guy who
messaged me the other day.
[389.97] He has been messaging me since last night,
 I have just had it.
[393.85] -Who is it?
-I don't know who it is.
[397.93] What's he saying?
[400.89] He is saying that, " Meet me,
talk to me over the phone."
[404.29] "I like you" and what not.
[408.15] So, just block him.
[411.39] I have blocked him many times.
He calls again and says,
[415.04] "Do you think I have just one number?"
[418.09] Give me his number. Tell me.
[430.61] He must be some roadside....
[432.93] -Take it easy, nothing is going to happen.
-Zoya, I am really worried.
[436.85] -Did you tell Zaid?
-No, why would I tell Zaid?
[439.83] He gets very emotional, and I don't want
to get him involved in this matter.
[444.03] Look, if he is from the university,
I will deal with him, okay?
[449.30] You just don't worry,
everything is going to be fine.
[463.33] His father was really sorry
 that he couldn't make it.
[467.63] But he had to attend an urgent meeting.
[471.25] No, there is nothing to be sorry about it.
[474.05] They sent you both, that is enough.
[476.75] And this shows
 that he is a man of principles.
[481.65] When are you getting done with your MBA?
[484.37] Uncle, it's expected
to end by the end of this year.
[486.25] Good, very good.
[490.76] Very nice, bless you, my child.
[503.75] -Please have something.
-Yes, sure.
[517.86] May God preserve you from evil eye.
[532.82] Thank you, thank you.
[537.09] Come, dear, have a seat.
[541.56] -Is she your only daughter?
-Yes, she is our only daughter.
[546.21] She has got brothers though.
[549.35] I mean she has got an elder brother.
[556.57] This means you have got just one son?
[559.23] Yes, a happy family with two kids only.
[578.93] Do you want more sugar, son?
[583.96] It's okay, it's okay.
[614.43] -So, Mr. Faizan. One spoon or two?
-Yes, that's enough.
[619.43] -One?
-Yes.
[621.34] Okay, so where do you see
yourself in five years?
[626.88] Actually I, I am planning to do some
IT courses along with dad's business.
[634.06] So that I can run my software house.
[636.59] My education... I have done my masters...
[644.67] -Why are you laughing?
-I'm... I'm so sorry.
[649.21] I was just playing a prank with you.
[651.38] It seems like you have come
to give a job interview.
[655.97] It's fine, it's nothing like that.
[658.65] In fact there is nothing wrong if you
ask me any question, that's your right.
[664.09] Why are you being so formal?
[666.52] How should I address you then?
[668.37] Well you can be a bit frank with me.
[671.67] -I mean, not too frank, right?
-Excuse me?
[676.34] -You can be informal with me.
-Okay, fine.
[681.09] Okay do one thing, why don't you
 hit once more?
[686.42] Where?
[688.06] Your dad is a bit relaxed after seeing you
cooperate with this proposal and all.
[693.32] Spend a little quality time with him,
[695.76] just talk to him showing love and...
[697.89] Why did I become unwanted
[702.58] Nobody knows that
[707.00] Why did I become unwanted
[711.76] Nobody knows that
[717.23] Okay, tell me something about your past.
[720.33] What do...
[725.64] What do you want to know about my past?
[729.27] I mean about my school or college and all?
[731.57] No, idiot... I mean did you have
any girl friend in the past?
[737.75] -No I have never had a girl friend.
-Why? Didn't you like anyone?
[741.75] No, I like one. I liked a girl in
class eight. No one else than that.
[750.13] I'm talking about recent times.
[752.66] Haven't you had any girlfriend recently?
[755.84] I didn't have anyone. Yes there was a girl.
[759.57] She tried to approach me
 but I didn't give her any response.
[764.30] -Why?Don't you like girls?
-No, I mean...
[768.98] What? I mean, do you like guys?
[775.27] Don't tell me that you swing the other way.
[777.98] No, no, it's not like that.
I do like girls.
[782.89] And I really like your sense of humor.
[787.78] I like you too, all of you.
[791.93] Thanks, by the way
what did you like about me?
[797.09] You are very interesting,
and I enjoyed your company.
[805.11] Thank you, I really like you a lot.
[810.24] And you are a natural, very natural.
You are very simple, no pretense.
[816.63] -I think we are going to get along well.
-You mean, made for each other?
[822.55] I do.
[824.58] Please have something.
[830.93] -By the way, the tea is really good.
-I haven't made it.
[834.93] You haven't? Well whoever has made it,
made it really well.
[843.46] Oh, sorry, please take a plate.
[847.16] No need of that.
[852.72] Nosheen, oh, my God.
Weren't you ashamed at all?
[857.05] -How were you ogling at that guy?
-I was ogling the way one is suppose to ogle.
[862.32] I wasn't aware of the level
of your mischievousness.
[869.26] Oh, come on. I had to do something.
What if they said they like me?
[874.42] Dad is ready as it is, so I
thought I must do something.
[879.70] Nosheen, no one can compete
your cunningness,
[881.34]  and you are getting even more
mischievous staying at home.
[884.22] Mother, I'm sure you must be
a firecracker like me in your youth.
[889.74] Nosheen, how are you talking to me?
I'm your mother!
[894.54] Well, I'm right. Daughters
take after their mothers.
[897.98] Stop it, Nosheen.
[901.92] Okay do one thing, why don't you
hit another shot?
[907.37] Where?
[909.10] Your dad is a bit relaxed after seeing you
cooperate with this proposal and all.
[914.07]  Spend a little quality time with him,
[916.80] just talk to him showing love,
and talk about some sensible things.
[921.43] Come on, Mother, I can't act.
[925.49] I am telling you this for your own benefit,
[927.47] may be this way your restrictions
are reduced as well.
[933.34] Okay, I'll think about it. Anything else?
[936.97] Okay, and do one thing after that,
apologize to your aunt as well.
[942.34] Apologize her for what?
I am not a walking apology letter.
[947.38] Excuse me , Nosheen. The scene that you
created the other day, apologize for that.
[952.72] Didn't you see what your sister does?
[955.38] She keeps recommending
proposals all the time.
[957.75] She has got proposals for the whole
world, but what about her own daughter?
[961.43] A walking matrimonial website.
[965.07] Nosheen, I can't win an argument
with you, okay?
[969.56] What kind of words are you
using for your aunt, Nosheen?
[973.23] Is that how you talk to elders?
[974.79] Oh, really? When I talk like that with my
paternal aunt then you have no issues.
[981.35] And you have told me yourself
to talk to you paternal aunt like this.
[985.43] Isn't she an elder too?
[988.08] Nosheen, nobody can stop you talking.
[991.79] Listen to me, Mother.
[993.56] From now on I am not only going to
reply rudely to my paternal aunt,
[996.87] but to everyone who messes with me.
[1041.11] What the hell did you do today?
[1045.07] -What's your problem, Zaid?
-I don't know, you tell me.
[1050.56] Zaid I really don't have
much time right now.
[1052.87] I have to prepare for my presentation,
so please go away from here.
[1056.25] -It's a ten-marks presentation. Just chill.
-Ten marks matter to me a lot too.
[1065.94] All right, just tell me when I told you
[1067.96] that I am going to drop you to the
university, why didn't you wake me up?
[1071.97] I called you a dozen times, but
you were sleeping like a log.
[1077.33] Firstly, I don't sleep like a log.
[1079.47] And secondly you know that
I don't attend calls.
[1083.68] I tried to come to your room and wake you
up, but there was a password on your door.
[1089.97] -Password?
-It was locked.
[1094.26] Oh, sh**. So, sorry.
[1097.72] Nosheen came last night,
so because of that...
[1104.13] Okay now go from here,
I have to prepare for my presentation.
[1107.29] Do it in front of me. I'll be the audience.
[1111.60] Zaid, you know that I prepare
my presentation in front of the mirror.
[1116.39] So, please go from here.
[1117.92] Come on, do it. Besides
I am getting bored.
[1125.21] Zaid, have you seen you eyes?
Oh, my God!
[1131.17] You have got dark circles.
[1133.75] Come on, go now and sleep on time.
[1136.70] Well, this is how lovers are identified.
[1146.42] What's wrong? Who was calling?
[1148.42] Actually, the group with which I am working
on my presentation, they were calling.
[1155.00] My teacher is so weird,
what group has he made.
[1157.84] We three were such a nice group, perfect.
[1163.87] Zaid, are you leaving or not?
[1168.39] Okay, do your assignment. I'm leaving.
[1182.17] Yes, Mr. Khalid,
[1184.12] It's okay if you couldn't make it, you
sent you wife and son, that was fine.
[1190.19] We will keep meeting in future.
[1193.54] It's all right. Okay, I'll talk to you
later then, thank you, thank you.
[1198.69] Yes? Everything all right?
[1202.23] -Dad, actually...
-What?
[1206.04] Dad, I have come to apologize to you.
[1210.52] -Apologize?
-And to spend some time with you.
[1217.52] Dad, I have started looking
at things from your point of view.
[1223.64] Well, I am really happy to see
[1227.76] that you are talking so sensibly.
[1235.57] Today, in front of the family
that came, I am assured
[1239.39] -that whatever you do is for my betterment.
-I am happy to know that.
[1244.79] -But, Dad, I have a complain too.
-What complain?
[1251.26] You don't believe me or mother,
[1256.35] but I want to tell you
something about Aima.
[1261.24] About Aima? What is it?
What do you want to tell?
[1264.96] Dad, since I have been staying at home,
[1268.74] Aima's behaviour has been
really rude with me.
[1273.81] -Has Aima misbehaved with you?
-Yes, Dad.
[1280.46] I was feeling really weak since yesterday.
[1284.55] There was a glass of juice in the kitchen.
I drank it so that I don't faint.
[1289.52] -So?
-Aima started shouting at me.
[1294.65] She told me that I should make it myself.
[1296.78] Dad, I told her that we stay in the
same house, we can share things.
[1300.72] So, do you know what she replied?
[1304.26] She said we live in the same house,
but we aren't the same family.
[1311.42] Until I speak to Aima about it,
I can't say anything.
[1318.80] Yes, Dad, I can understand.
[1322.09] Dad, Aima is so shrewd that she always
pretend to be naive in front of you.
[1339.46] Actually, Dad, I want to talk
 to you about something else too.
[1346.22] Why did I become unwanted
[1350.46] Nobody knows that
[1355.32] Why did I become unwanted
[1360.10] Nobody knows that
[1378.18] What should I do? Should I call Zoya?
[1384.78] No, this is your issue, Aima,
and you are going to handle it yourself.
[1395.94] You won't give up, will you?
[1408.63] What do you think of yourself? Who are you?
[1412.06] Who the hell are you
that I would get angry with you.
[1414.52] Bloody low life, loser.
[1439.87] Zoya.
[1442.23] Yes, Mom?
[1445.40] -You didn't tell me how your meeting went.
-It went well.
[1452.06] -So, how is the guy?
-He is nice too.
[1456.89] That's really great that you liked the guy.
[1459.98] Shall I invite his family then?
[1461.84] Wait a second.
When did I said that I like the guy.
[1467.71] You just told me that you like the guy.
[1470.79] Yes, that's true, the guy is nice.
[1474.71] Then the next step is that
the elders sit together,
[1479.00] and discuss the future plans.
[1481.92] Mom, I said the guy is good.
I didn't say that he is good for me.
[1489.80] -What's the difference between these two?
-There is a lot of difference, Mom.
[1493.65] I mean he is a very naive, simple kind,
you know pampered kind of a guy?
[1499.10] But he is not my type.
[1501.80] Well, isn't that a good thing?
 He will be under your control.
[1506.27] Mom, please don't say such typical things,
[1508.96] and what do you mean he
will stay under control?
[1511.22] I am going to get married,
not buy a puppet.
[1516.12] Oh, Zoya you have a weird logic.
[1519.07] Mom, Zoya likes good guys, who have got
a spark in them, who have a personality.
[1524.51] Well then you should say
 that you like scumbags.
[1529.00] When did I say that?
[1530.24] A guy has a certain personality, he is
presentable. He has a sense of humor.
[1537.74] A guy who has all these qualities
 would be one in a million.
[1542.18] Well, I am going to find him then, Mom.
[1544.18] Why are you in a hurry?
[1547.77] -Again this stubborn attitude.
-What do you mean?
[1551.07] Well, this. After so much schooling
 you liked a guy,
[1559.80] and now you are rejecting him as well.
[1564.63] The same issue again,
thats why am I in a hurry.
[1567.85] Mom, I have told you not to worry,
and I am serious about getting married.
[1572.48] Zoya, think about it
one more time, my child.
[1576.91] One doesn't find such a proposal easily.
[1579.94] Mom, please, I understand that you want
me to get married as soon as possible,
[1583.82] but that doesn't mean you are going
to get me married with anybody.
[1588.33] Look, I would like to
explore my options first,
[1591.12] and I am going to reach
a conclusion eventually.
[1595.75] Well this means that you are
going to meet 30, 40 guys
[1598.96] and then select someone to get married.
[1604.37] Not a bad idea, Mommy.
[1606.18] The more the options,
the better the decision.
[1619.63] My university is going
to be over in a few months.
[1622.14] So, I was thinking of doing
some courses on finance.
[1624.53]  You know, I think they might help.
[1627.75] Yes, that might be good.
[1631.25] I am trying to join your office as soon
as possible. If it's okay with you.
[1636.82] Why would I have an issue with it,
this is something to be happy about.
[1641.40] Besides, I want myself
that you join the office.
[1645.73] It's getting difficult for me to handle
all that work, I get tired.
[1650.04] I am happy that you have gotten
serious about your life.
[1654.69] Thank you, Dad.
[1658.48] Dad, I... I want to talk to you
about something else too.
[1664.87] Tell me, what is it?
[1669.74] Don't you think that we are being
a little hasty in getting Nosheen married.
[1676.57] Not at all.
[1678.06] I think she should complete
her bachelors, at least.
[1681.18] I mean, Dad, these aren't ancient times.
Getting education is very important.
[1687.27] Just imagine if God forbid
there is any crisis tomorrow,
[1689.75] then how is she going to survive
without education, without any skills.
[1693.47] And when she isn't educated herself,
how is she going to raise her children?
[1697.12] You think that I am the one who has
stopped Nosheen to get education?
[1703.06] I am not a conservative man.
[1705.28] I believe that girls have as much right
of getting an education, as guys do.
[1713.24] I even want that Aima joins me
at office after completing her university.
[1719.00] That would be really great, Dad.
[1721.41] And as far as Nosheen is concerned, she has
stopped herself from getting educated.
[1726.23] She is not interested in getting
into a university or in her studies.
[1728.86] What if tomorrow she does something
which is impossible to rectify?
[1733.06] That is why, according to me
 getting her married is the best decision.
[1737.45] But still I am going to consider
your opinion, rethink about it.
[1750.49] Actually I want to talk
to you about one more thing.
[1757.66] Since a few days, mama's attitude
with aunt and Aima is really bad,
[1762.26] and Aima is really
disturbed because of that.
[1764.42] Really? Aima didn't tell me about it.
[1768.65] When does she tell
anything to anyone, Dad.
[1770.14] It was me who insisted so
much that she had to tell me.
[1774.74] Moreover, following mother,
Nosheen has also
[1777.38] adopted an inappropriate attitude with her.
[1780.91] I have an idea about that, but still, I'll
look into it, how to handle this issue.
[1787.60] But, Dad, please don't let mother
know that we had talked about it,
[1791.56] or aunt or Aima have complained about it.
[1795.05] Don't worry, I know what I have to do.
[1798.67] You're getting late from the university,
look at the time.
[1801.14] Yes, Dad. I'll leave now,
see you, if God wills.
[1804.51] -Good bye.
-Good bye.
[1812.12] -Greetings, aunt.
-Greetings, sit down, dear.
[1820.85] -How are you doing?
-I am good, how are you feeling?
[1826.46] I am much better by the grace of God.
[1830.62] I had a few complains from you.
[1833.39] You know well that I don't
hold anything to myself.
[1837.79] -Is everything all right, dear?
-Aunt,
[1840.16] You must know, a family came to meet me.
[1844.05] Yes, Zaid told me.
[1847.41] And still you didn't come to meet them?
[1850.63] They must be thinking
that dad doesn't treat you well,
[1855.93] that's why he hasn't
called you to meet them.
[1858.99] Dear...
[1862.28] I didn't come because I thought
you or sister would mind it.
[1868.23] Well, it doesn't matter whether
 me and mother mind something or not.
[1875.00] I think dad would have really felt bad
that you didn't care about his honor.
[1881.51] It just didn't feel right to me,
going and sitting there.
[1884.86] Okay, auntie, if you don't mind
 may I ask you something?
[1892.32] -Sure, why not?
-Aima has reached the age of marriage as well.
[1898.19] But she isn't getting any proposals.
[1902.08] It's nothing like that, dear.
[1903.99] Aima's paternal aunt 
has given her son's proposal for Aima.
[1909.06] Why don't you take it seriously then?
[1911.98] Nosheen, I didn't understand
 what you are trying to say.
[1916.73] Auntie, I want to say that,
is Aima having an affair?
[1925.98] No, it's nothing like that.
[1929.30] The way you both are carefree 
about it, it seems that's true.
[1933.08] that there is an affair going on.
[1936.87] Look, Aima doesn't hide anything from me.
[1942.96] Auntie, all mothers think
[1945.65] that their daughters are like 
an open book in front of them.
[1948.37] That's why all mothers keep praising
how pious their daughters are.
[1953.13] But you can't even imagine
 what they do behind their mothers' back.
[1960.70] Nosheen, please think before you talk.
[1965.96] Besides, those are different kind of girls.
[1970.09] Oh, auntie, you don't know.
[1976.91] Girls get out of their homes, 
wearing scarves and stoles,
[1980.58] and when they reach their
college or university,
[1983.54] there is no sign of a scarf and stole.
[1990.31] The one who doesn't get caught
 is the pious one.
[1994.24] I am not accusing anyone, 
I was just saying like that.
[2000.96] And by looking at Aima's silence
and carefree attitude,
[2005.85] it just crossed my mind, 
so I thought I should ask you.
[2009.57] All right, please rest now.
[2013.87] I have got so much work to do, I'll leave.
[2035.73] Why did I become unwanted
[2040.39] Nobody knows that
[2044.90] Why did I become unwanted
[2054.47] I have an idea that Almas and Nosheen
have adopted an unfair behaviour with you.
[2062.84] Is that true?
[2064.35] Your dear aunt, poisons
your dad against me.
[2072.33] No, no, I haven't talked 
to brother about it at all.
[2077.67] If you hadn't said anything,
[2079.41] Azmat wouldn't have rebuked me
so much without any reason.
[2082.93] The world might feel pity 
on your miserable face.
[2086.39] But don't you dare show your
cunningness in front of me.
