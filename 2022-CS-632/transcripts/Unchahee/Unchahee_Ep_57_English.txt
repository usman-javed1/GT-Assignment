From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you Faisal, what do you think? Am I
going to still get blackmailed by you? Look, I didn't say anything like that. Do one thing, tell anyone
anything you want to. I am not going to be
intimidated by your threats, got it? I never think wrong about you, but it's true that I like
to spend time with you. Is this something that
is acceptable for a wife? Answer me. How can you block me from here? -Faisal, go away from here, I say go away.
-Nosheen, who is it? Greetings, auntie. I'm Faisal. She is only going to stay with
you when you will divorce Aima. -What if I don't do that?
-Up to you. You can forget about Zoya
and your kid then. -Are you threatening me?
-You can think of it whatever you like. But Zoya is not going to
change her decision now. What's wrong, Nosheen,
you didn't get ready yet? Auntie, I was just going to. You might get late. What time was
your appointment with the doctor? 2:00 pm. Oh, okay. You are going with Faiq, right? I had informed Faiq,
if he comes I'll go with him. Otherwise, I'll go myself. Why will you go alone? Go with Faiq. And if he gets stuck in dome
work then I'll go with you. Forget it, auntie,
I know what is he busy with. Why are you thinking like that? If you'll think positive all
positive things will happen. I am thinking right, auntie. You know, even after so much
has happened, he still meets Sania. He talks to her secretly. Yes, I have an idea. -If you know it why don't you do anything?
-I can't stop him. Because he won't stop if I'll stop him. Means all this is going
to carry on like that? -No.
-What are you trying to say? What shall I do that he stops? You'll have to make
your place in his heart. And youâ€™ll have to make him
realize that you love him sincerely. Auntie, Faiq married me
after he believed on this fact. Forget about how you guys got married. I don't understand what that Sania has
that Faiq is still after her. Whereas I am much
more beautiful than Sania. It's not about beauty. Then what is it about? A man
needs freedom and peace only. If a woman keeps nagging at home
all the time and there is no peace left a man looks for these things outside then. And then, wherever he gets peace and
freedom, he gets attached there. So, isn't there any peace in our home? There is, but not like
the peace that he wants. Means, you consider Faiq as right? You think whatever he is doing is right? Not at all, I am not one of those mothers who keep taking their son's
side even if he is at fault. But you always keep telling me to correct
myself. Why don't you say anything to him? It's not like that, I tell him that too.
But you should understand this too. It's in nature of men, as much as they are prohibited
or stopped to do something, they get attracted to that thing as much. Then what should I do? Should I keep
watching their affair and close my eyes? -I have just one solution now.
-What's that? I'll tell my family everything
clearly and leave this house. A wise woman deals
with all these problems. She never runs away by leaving her home. I am fed up now, I can't
deal with it everyday. Faiq has sworn upon me that he has no illicit
relation with Sania. And I believe that. Okay, if you say so. Nothing of this sort will happen. Just remember one thing. Solve every matter
calmly through discussion. Loud voice makes  what
you are saying lose its effect . Do you get it? Hello, Faiq, Yeah, I'll be ready in 5 minutes. Faiq is coming, isn't he? -Yeah, I'll get ready.
-Go get ready nicely. Mom, I told you not to do this
drama, but no, you don't listen to me. Now bear with this situation. Hey, what's wrong?
Why are you getting so hyper? Mom, because the problem that you have got
me into, I am unable to deal with that. -You don't have to do anything.
-Why not? If we have a fight with Zaid
and if he files a case on us, then? Have you ever thought about it? Oh, I'm telling you, they
aren't going to do anything. And Zaid, he isn't able to do anything. Won't do anything? How
do you know that they won't? What's wrong with you
Zoya, why are you yelling? Do you want everyone to know? Doesn't matter if anyone gets to
know about it or not, I'm going to tell everyone
that all this is a drama, and I'm not going to be a mom. What did you get me into, Mom? Actually, after telling all this at least
I am going to take the burden off me. Why were you doing it ma... Hello,  hello, Zoya? -Zoya?
-Mom, Aima has heard everything. What? Thank God, everything is fine. Yeah, you just have to
take care of yourself now. Take good diet, juices
and have lots of fruits. Why? Aren't you going to take care of me? Nosheen, why do you deduce
the opposite of everything? What am I saying to you
and what are you answering? What did I say? I can't stay at home at
serve you all the time. So, I'll tell you to take care of
yourself. Stop being stubborn like kids. I was just joking. A person is not in a mood to
joke that he can get your jokes. What's wrong? I was just
trying to make this moment nice and you are getting angry for no reason. Nosheen, you are so complaining.
Every person has a limit of tolerance. And with you my limit is
crossed. I am sick of you. Well, let me tell you then. Zoya has told them that she will continue her pregnancy
only when Zaid gives you a divorce. To make you feel even better I
wanted to tell you a good news. Good news? Prepare yourself to run around. Sister, brother Azmat, you both are going to become grandparents. Yes, my Zoya is expecting. Okay, first relax and tell me in detail that since when
are you tolerating his blackmailing? And why didn't you tell me before? Actually, I got scared that if I tell something to
someone, things might get worse. You are mad. -I just got afraid.
-And these loafers take advantage of this fear. You're right. Just wait and watch what
I am going to do to him. Just don't get too angry,
please stay relaxed. What if something else happens?
He is a very cheap and cunning person. He can't do anything to me. Send
me his details, first. All the details What numbers did he
use to send you messages and used to call you,
send me everything. I am going to take care of him today. I'll just send you after I go home. Send me right now! I'll search and send you then. Please don't get so angry,
I'm scared for you. Nosheen, nothing will
happen to me, don't worry. What if he tells everything to Faiq? Didn't tell you, he won't even think about you after
today letting alone contacting you. Tell me, have you told
about it to anyone else? No, just my mother in
law knows everything. What have you done? -And what if she tells Faiq?
-She won't tell him. How can you trust her? She takes my side more than Faiq's. That's
why she won't tell anything to Faiq. Just consider her as my
friend and my confidante too. Don't know, you have done something silly. -Anyway...
-Don't worry about her just take care of yourself. I'm fine, nothing is going to
happen to me. I'll drop you now. And send me his details
as soon as you reach home. -Understand?
-Yes, I'll send you. -Can I say something?
-Yes, what is it? Why don't you come back home now? Dad is changed too. I know, he is changed. -How do you know?
-I went to the hospital. Okay. I met Zaid too. Zaid? What did he say? Nothing much, he just
gave me dad's message. Message? What message? -I'll tell you later.
-Come on, tell me. Told you, I'll tell you later. By the way, Zaid has told
me few other things too. He told me the good news too. Congratulations. Thank you. I am going to give you
all a surprise too soon. Surprise? What surprise? As I said, it's a surprise. Let's go now, I'll drop you. And give
me all his details right away, okay? Okay fine. -Isn't Zaid home?
-No, he must be at office. I called office too, I talked
to them but he isn't there. Really? Zoya and Aima are home too. Where did he go then? Well, he might have gone
for some work or to his friends. -What's wrong?
-Nothing. I have a feeling that you
want to say something. Do you know? He came to meet me. Really? Are you serious? Why didn't you tell me? When did he come? He came to the hospital,
when I was admitted, then. Really? Thank God. -So, did he say something?
-Yeah, he did. He was apologizing. So? Did you forgive him then? Look, you have forgiven Nosheen, too. Besides, he is our eldest son, we
have raised him with so much love. Yeah. Parents make so many efforts, go through
so much difficulties to raise their kids. But they don't realize it at all. They just think that the parents have
fulfilled their responsibility, that's it. No, they do realize it when
they become parents themselves. You are right. Tell me honestly, Azmat,
why didn't Hammad come home? Didn't you treat him right? He is so stubborn. I'll call
him and ask him to come. No need to call him. If he is
stubborn then I am his father too. Whoever wants to come
will come by himself. By the way, one thing made me happy, that Nosheen's mother in
law is very happy with her. Looks like she is trying to
make her marriage work. What happened? What is wrong?
What is it, just listen to me. Why are you hitting me? Do you know who I am? Recognize me? -We are just friends.
-I am your death! Do you recognize who I am? I haven't done anything
bad to her, listen to me. Nosheen, yes! Do you remember now? I took just a little money
from her, I'll return. I am going to take all the money back,
you will have to return them, understood? Yes, Mr. Safdar,
Zaid here, what is it? Look, I have decided,
please get the papers ready. I have to file a case
on my wife at any cost. I want my child at any cost, I won't
get threatened by anyone for that. Okay. Okay. -What happened, Zaid?
-Nothing. You seem worried, is
there a problem at office? No, you tell me, did you want anything? Yes, I wanted to talk
to you about something. -What is it?
-Actually, Zaid, -I wanted to...
-What is it, Aima? Just say it. Actually, Zaid... Zaid, I wanted to... Zaid, you're here? I was
looking for you inside. What were you saying, Aima?
What did you want to talk me about? Zaid, dad is looking for you inside, he wants to talk to you
about something important, come. Were you trying to tell Zaid? First, you did something very unethical, You eavesdropped outside my room and then you
are telling it to Zaid? -Aren't you ashamed?
-Should I be ashamed or you? You are the one who is doing
such a big fraud with Zaid, not me. -And it is not a small thing.
-And you? What opinion do you
have about yourself, Aima? Me? What did I do? Aima, you didn't care about my emotions. And I used to trust you
the most in this world. And you didn't even consider it. You made a promise to me, didn't
you? What happened to that promise? Tell me, why aren't you saying something? You were my friend, right?
Why did you do it to me then? I didn't consider you as a
friend by my sister, Aima. And you were the most
important person for me. I never needed a sister because I had you. And that friend wants to ruin
me instead of supporting me. She wants to ruin my marriage. Look, Zoya, I don't
want anything like that. What do you think, that if you are going to tell this
to Zaid, won't he react over it? -Yes but you told such a big lie to Zaid.
-Yes, I lied, I lied to him. And you are the reason for that, Aima. You took away my happiness. And I'm not doing all this happily. I'm compelled to do it. If you want to ruin my
life then go, tell it to Zaid. I won't stop you, Aima.
But remember one thing, After that I will lose
trust on friendship. Just tell me that in such a situation,
can the husband file a legal case or not? Oh, I know all that. Just get me all the details
about this issue and inform me. Yeah, do it quickly, Iâ€™ll be waiting. Okay. If he files such a case then I will
have to handle Zaid in some other way, otherwise, there will be a huge problem. If you aren't sleeping
then at least talk to me. I'm sleepy, it's better
that you sleep too. I know you're angry with me. I said, it would be better
if we don't talk right now. In fact, if you want to go
to your mom's that fine too. It's better that you leave
until the case is decided. What decision? Decision about the case. I have filed a case on you, Zoya, that you are threatening
me to kill my unborn child. You are harassing me. You'll get a legal notice
from my lawyer tomorrow. We are going to work on the same strategy
now. Because I want full profit this year. Okay, listen, I'll talk to you in a while. But don't forget to
reply their email, okay. Okay, bye. Zoya, you this early in
the morning? Everything okay? You should be thankful
that I came in the morning, otherwise I was supposed
to come last night. -What do you mean?
-The meaning is simple, Mom. -I knew it already.
-What? The game that we
started had to end one day. Rather it hasn't ended yet. Why are you talking in riddles, why don't
you tell me clearly what has happened? Okay then, I'll tell you clearly. Zaid has asked me to leave his home. -How dare he ask my daughter to...
-He is very daring. He is sending a notice in few days too. What notice? You are pretending to be so
innocent as if you don't know anything. The fraud we had done with Zaid,
this reaction was expected on it. You should be thankful that
he doesn't know the whole truth. The day he gets to know about it, instead
of a notice he will send divorce papers. Then let him send it, I don't care. Why would you, Mom? Besides, it's my life what
difference does it make to you? I will be the one suffering. Actually, you are right. Yeah. What difference does it make to me?
It's not like I love you or anything. I didn't mean that. No, Zoya, you're right. Yes, who am I to take
decisions about your life? Please, Mom, can you stop? Don't worry, Zoya, you won't
have any complaints with me now. From now on I am not going to
interfere in your personal life at all. Do what you feel is good for you. I want that you... divorce me. -Greetings, auntie.
-Greetings, I am so happy to see you. Didn't you miss us since so long? Missed you all a lot, that's why I'm back. How are you doing, Dad? Look, please don't start that
again. I'm already too tired. If Sania had messaged you right now
then you wouldn't have been tired. Oh, shut up, Nosheen,
what are you saying? I'm saying the truth. You aren't even happy about our
kid, you are concerned with him at least. I know that you haven't forgiven me. How can you say that? Because I am unhappy. I am unhappy even after trying so hard. If you don't get happiness through
a relationship, then you should end it. And at times one has to break the
relationships for others' happiness too.
