[0.00] From flowers and from buds
[4.54] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.13] When I saw you
[14.07] I learned how to chirp from you
[19.17] You are getting married.
[24.05] And you know well that after getting
married the responsibilities increase.
[29.84] I'll be happy if you keep your focus on your
responsibilities more than your hobbies.
[35.30] Faiq, why don't you talk to me?
I've been missing you for so long.
[39.66] Do you know that I was with Aima?
[42.70] What if she got to know?
[44.62] I don't care whatever she thinks.
[47.45] -Did you see? Nosheen was here.
-Nosheen?
[52.71] With whom?
[54.61] No idea, she just left.
[71.55] The one I was talking to right here.
[74.50] -Oh , yes, yes.
-Who was he with?
[77.04] He came with a lady.
[79.21] So, he had to leave due to an emergency.
[86.48] Where did Nosheen go today?
[88.77] When?
[91.68] Today.
[92.71] Where else would she go. She might
have gone to college before I got up.
[97.21] She should have been in college
but I saw her somewhere else.
[107.09] Tell me, what is it that's bothering you?
[111.91] Do you think that Faiq is interested in me?
[116.50] What kind of a question is this?
[163.60] Just listen to me carefully once.
[165.93] On the stole with the red dress
you have to do golden peco,
[170.86] and on the stole with blue
dress you have to do red peco.
[177.76] Now please don't spoil my dress.
[181.12] Yeah, okay. So, tell me
when should I pick them up?
[187.54] Okay, fine, bye.
[191.60] Oh, God! The most difficult
thing during wedding days
[195.29] is to give instructions to the tailor.
[198.70] And after that?
[201.04] After that, understanding.
[204.77] Why are you asking me? I don't
know myself that's why I'm asking you.
[213.93] What's wrong? Why such a long face?
[217.52] No, not at all, I'm fine.
[221.60] Something has happened. Let me
guess, did you get scolded by dad?
[227.44] No, no, what's wrong?
[230.17] Then there must be just one reason 
behind it, you're missing Zoya.
[238.18] By the way, I too miss
Faiq a lot these days.
[244.47] Really?
[247.53] The real question is, 
does Faiq misses you too?
[252.66] Why did you ask this question?
[255.57] Just like that.
[257.50] Yeah, he must be missing me too.
[261.18] He must have told you, 
we met at the restaurant.
[265.38] Really? Which restaurant?
[267.94] What do you mean? Didn't he tell you?
[270.63] No, actually we didn't talk 
for the past two days.
[275.26] Is everything all right?
[277.97] Yeah, all is well,
he must be busy with his business.
[282.72] I'm sure he will call me once he is free.
[286.74] Didn't he even get time to call at night?
[289.72] May be he gets tired at night
and he doesn't feel like talking, so...
[300.12] Zaid, should I tell you something?
[305.41] I think that
[310.19] I have started liking Faiq too.
[316.39] Okay, fine, but don't you change 
after marriage, okay?
[319.91] -You don't change.
-I'm not changing, why would I change?
[322.57] If not you, Zoya might change.
[324.01] -No, we are going to stay the same.
-That's out of question.
[326.05] No, no, I have observed there is too
much discussion about Faiq going on.
[356.30] Don't you have any manners? 
Why are you checking my phone?
[359.68] -Why is Faiq messaging you?
-Mind your own business.
[363.37] Nosheen, I'm your elder brother,
I have a right to know.
[366.52] You are my elder brother, that doesn't mean
you are going to invade into my privacy.
[371.04] Just tell me the reason
why he is messaging you.
[375.26] What's wrong, why are you
creating such a big scene?
[378.16] Besides, anybody can talk to anyone.
[380.46] Anybody can talk to anyone, but there
is no reason that you two should talk.
[385.39] You don't need to bother, 
this is my private matter.
[389.34] This is not a private matter, Nosheen.
God dammit, Faiq is committed to Aima.
[395.30] Are you crazy? Back off.
[399.93] You went to the restaurant with
him the other day, didn't you?
[403.07] -Which day?
-Nosheen, don't act innocent, I know everything.
[406.11] Don't put these stupid allegations on me.
[408.56] -So, didn't you go to lunch with him?
-What proof do you have?
[411.30] Proof? The proof is in this phone,
show it to me. Give me the phone.
[413.78] Back off, have you gone mad?
[416.07] And I'm telling you, if you take
the phone forcefully from me then I...
[419.33] Forceful? What will you do? What?
[422.01] I'm, I'm telling you...
[424.46] Zaid, what are you doing, Zaid? 
Why did you snatch her phone?
[429.31] He has gone crazy. You should be thankful
that you didn't get married to him.
[435.68] What's wrong, Zaid?
[438.64] Nothing.
[462.18] What is it Aima? Everything all right?
[465.84] Yeah, I was just...
[469.66] Nobody cries without any reason.
[471.63] It's your best friend's wedding.
[475.24] And Zoya is coming to this house 
after getting married to Zaid.
[478.18] What's in it to cry?
[479.80] Faiq, I'm crying because 
I'm going to get married soon too.
[489.41] I'm going to move to your home.
[493.44] Zoya's departure from her house to
this house made me think of my departure.
[502.80] That's why I got emotional.
[505.55] Are you sure that's the reason?
[507.30] Why would I hide anything from you?
[509.62] No, I'm not bothered.
[511.71] I just came to say that  if there is
anything you can share it with me.
[516.22] Anything that you would
like to discuss, I'm here.
[520.07] Faiq, I don't get what
you are trying to say.
[523.25] Aima, I have a feeling 
that you are hiding something from me.
[525.89] Why would I hide anything from you?
[527.94] I have noticed that you have been
very disturbed during the whole wedding,
[531.92] and I didn't find it normal.
[533.49] I have told you that by
looking at Zoya's departure
[537.76] I was thinking of the time
when I am going to leave.
[541.84] I just got tearful by thinking that I am
going to miss all of these people so much.
[551.51] All the people in this house, 
the time I've spent here, my family.
[558.26] Your family or someone
specific in that family?
[653.34] Don't know how much longer 
do I have to sit like this.
[657.01] And this dress, it's so heavy.
[662.46] And these bangles, 
they are hurting my hands.
[669.77] No, mama said I should
stay like this until Zaid arrives.
[678.25] I'm getting suffocated in this dress.
[683.37] Where is he?
[714.36] Why are you sitting here?
[717.19] Actually my dress is too heavy, 
so I wasn't able to sit on the bed.
[722.54] So I sat here.
[727.01] I had an idea that I'm not
getting married to an ordinary girl.
[733.83] -So, can I sit here?
-Yeah, why not?
[737.41] In fact which book states that the bride
and groom can't sit on the sofa and talk?
[744.31] Thank God!
[746.57] You should have told me earlier, I would
have decorated the sofa instead of the bed.
[751.49] Are you making fun of me?
[756.40] Zoya!
[758.59] Zoya, what's wrong
with your make up?
[760.67] You lipstick isn't right too,
your eye liner, your stole...
[766.62] And your hair, I mean, I don't know
[770.74] but even after all that, 
you look very pretty.
[777.79] Honestly?
[780.12] Will I every praise you falsely?
[785.29] Thank you.
[786.59] Zoya, what is this nonsense?
[791.12] What's wrong?
[791.86] I mean, aren't you going to praise me?
[796.83] By looking at you, it
seems as if you are
[800.17] attending a poetic gathering
to recite your poetry.
[807.09] -Should I tell you something?
-Sure, go ahead.
[810.44] Please, I'm your husband.
[812.60] Okay, sorry, continue.
[815.25] The thing you said about poetic
gathering reminded me of something,
[818.18] I brought something for you.
[821.57] -What?
-No, forget it, you're going to make fun of me.
[825.38] Tell me, what did you get me?
[828.05] Should I tell?
[830.27] -You sure?
-Zaid...
[841.61] -Hey, Zoya!
-Don't tell me, Zaid,
[844.88] you've written poetry for me?
[847.78] -Just give it back, I...
-Wait a second, let me read.
[852.27] Is this the night 
Or have you let your hair down
[857.80] Hair let down.
[860.82] Is this moon light 
or is the night been
[863.64] -washed with my eyes.
-Washed?
[867.64] Is this the moon or your bangle?
[872.14] Means, you're going to write anything?
[873.86] Yeah, so,  just forget it then.
[875.55] Wait a second, I'm going to read it all.
[889.20] What's wrong with you?
[891.83] Nothing.
[894.02] Zaid, look at her eyes.
[897.39] I have an idea, Zoya, 
I know why her eyes are like that.
[901.72] Remember, when I used
to stay up all night missing you
[904.86] then my eyes
used to turn like that too.
[908.09] Stop being so dramatic.
[910.19] Okay, listen, should I tell Aima?
[914.66] What?
[920.03] She already knows it.
[922.38] Don't tell me that this was Aima's idea.
[925.53] No, it wasn't my idea, in fact I told
him that this idea with poetry won't work.
[931.71] Thank God.
[935.37] Is it okay?
[938.46] Hey, wait a second. I forgot to show you.
[943.03] Look at that.
[945.13] Zaid gave this to me last night.
[946.87] Isn't it beautiful?
[951.10] For your kind information, 
this was chosen by Aima too.
[956.07] Seriously, Zaid? For once, 
choose something yourself too.
[959.93] I have chosen you, what else do you want?
[963.68] Yeah, that's true.
[965.72] I said yes because of Aima.
[967.91] If it weren't for her I wouldn't
have said yes for marrying you.
[972.27] That's true, I agree.
[978.34] Zoya, tickets confirmed. We will have
to leave two days after Aima's wedding.
[983.33] Where to?
[985.58] For our honeymoon. 
You should come with us too.
[989.57] It's your honeymoon. What would I do there?
[993.46] You won't go alone. 
We'll take Faiq along too.
[997.44] Yeah, Aima, please come with us.
[999.45] It would be so much fun, 
both of us couples.
[1003.28] -I don't think that it's possible.
-Everything is possible, you just agree.
[1008.92] -But Faiq?
-I'll talk to Faiq.
[1013.93] I have noticed, Aima, 
you're being very formal with us.
[1018.87] It's nothing like that. I just want
to get personal space to you two.
[1022.88] Hey, we don't want your personal space.
[1026.45] Yeah, we all are going 
to stay together, okay?
[1029.57] And you are coming to lunch with us.
[1031.53] Done, it's done.
[1033.54] No, that's not the right thing 
to do, everyone's going to object.
[1037.24] It won't look nice.
[1038.61] It doesn't matter if anyone has
any objection, we don't have any.
[1041.22] -Isn't it so, Zaid?
-Yes, absolutely.
[1042.87] So, it's decided, you are
coming to lunch with us. okay?
[1057.74] It's so nice of you to visit today.
[1060.48] Shabana, I was asking Faiq
for so long, he just didn't get time.
[1064.61] How is your work going on?
[1066.98] -Going good, uncle.
-That's great.
[1069.70] Shabana, where is Aima? It's been
a full week that I haven't met her.
[1074.71] Actually, sister Nimra,
[1077.91] you know well that Zaid and Zoya
don't go anywhere without Aima.
[1083.52] They insisted for dinner so she went along.
[1087.19] Had you told me earlier that you are
coming then I would have stopped her.
[1090.23] No, it's all right, let the kids enjoy.
[1093.24] Besides, it's a matter of few days,
[1095.94] Aima is going to depart
from this house too.
[1097.83] -Are you done with your preparations?
-Than God,
[1101.85] all preparations are completed,
now we need just Aima in that house.
[1105.71] With God's will, Aima is going to go
to your house too in a couple of days.
[1110.34] With God's will, for sure.
[1112.50] -Excuse me.
-Yeah, sure.
[1115.90] There are a lot of preparations to do in
a house where wedding is taking place.
[1117.70]  It's really difficult to handle all of it.
[1119.35] But all the hustle bustle 
is because of that.
[1121.91] We wait for it all our lives.
[1125.33] That's true. That's exactly how it is.
[1130.16] What a pleasant surprise,
auntie, how are you doing?
[1133.60] Very well, dear.
[1135.20] Your dress is so pretty.
[1138.86] Thank you so much, 
I got it as a gift from someone.
[1142.09] Oh, you're here as well. 
Sorry, I took your place.
[1146.93] -No, it's okay, please sit.
-No, please you sit down.
[1150.53] Thank you.
[1151.62] Hey, you're fond of
playing the guitar, right?
[1154.97]  One of my friends is really fond too.
[1157.62] I have a video of hers in my laptop.
[1159.32] Come lets go to my room, I'll show you.
[1163.02] Just send me her video,
I'll take a look at it in my phone.
[1166.30] It's in my laptop, I've
been saving it for so long.
[1169.89]  Just come, I'm going to show it to you.
[1174.31] All right, let's go.
[1180.92] -Have you made the guest list?
-Yeah, sure.
[1185.52] All these things are going on. 
Besides I gave this task to Faiq.
[1188.98] No matter if it's the bride's
house or the groom's house,
[1191.22]  the things to do are similar at a wedding.
[1193.12] Yeah, but the groom's family is happy
that they are going to take the bride away.
[1198.94] Nosheen, you brought me here
in front of everyone.
[1202.39] What must everyone be thinking?
[1204.95] Faiq, relax, nobody is
going to think anything.
[1207.73] And just don't stay afraid all the time.
[1210.19] Okay, tell me, why did you bring me here?
[1213.36] Just like that, because I wanted to.
[1217.58] -Okay, I'll get something for you.
-No, I don't want anything.
[1222.81] Just sit down, 
 and please don't be shy in front of me.
[1248.51] You didn't have to.
[1251.74] You never feel the need of anything.
[1255.61] Nosheen, why are you so complacent?
[1260.73] If you mind my complains, 
I'll stop it then.
[1268.38] Nosheen, what are you doing?
[1273.12] Faiq? Can't I do it?
[1276.71] Look, this isn't right.
[1279.37] What's wrong with it, Faiq?
Can't two people fall in love?
[1283.97] -Try to understand, Nosheen.
-I don't want to understand, Faiq.
[1288.07] Don't stop me please. Besides you are going
to be taken away from me in a few days.
[1293.65] Nosheen, I can't do this. 
I'm getting married in a few days.
[1298.25] Faiq, I'm just asking 
for a little time from you.
[1301.80] A time where it's just you and me 
and our love.
[1310.83] Can't you even spare a few moments for me?
[1316.94] Fine, then. You should've told me 
when I came to your place.
[1321.41] You should have thrown me out of your
house. Why did you get so close to me?
[1324.94] Why do you talk to me 
over the phone all night long?
[1330.85] Faiq why don't you
admit that you want it too?
[1336.14] And you just don't have 
the courage to accept it.
[1339.35] Don't lie to me, Faiq.
[1521.19] Please come, Dad.
[1525.62] -You look so pretty.
-Thank you, Dad.
[1529.28] Aima, I'm sad too but happy for you too.
[1533.70] Please don't be sad, Dad.
[1537.16] I'll come to you whenever you'll call me.
[1540.34] I want you to take care of all my business.
[1544.33] And I don't think Faiq would
have any objection to it too.
[1547.56] Sure, just don't worry, I'm
definitely going to fulfill your wish.
[1553.74] This is for you.
[1558.04] What is this, Dad?
[1559.94] It's a small gift from my side for you.
[1563.59] -What gift?
-I got a flat booked for you.
[1567.77] These are the ownership documents of that.
[1570.07] May this house be lucky for you.
[1575.77] No, are you crying?
[1580.55] You are not supposed to be sad my child
[1584.18] It's the time to be joyous.
[1586.26] These are tears of joy, Dad.
[1590.26] You have never let me miss my Dad.
[1595.86] Had father been alive today, he would
have taken care of me as much as you have.
[1603.90] God took away my father from me.
[1607.77] But he made you as
my guardian in his place.
[1611.95] I'm happy for you, Aima.
[1615.67] Just don't forget your dad 
after going to your in laws.
[1623.16] I will never forget you.
[1632.52] I love you, stay blessed.
[1647.13] Greetings.
[1649.31] Congratulations, Shabana
that we get to see this day too.
[1652.65] -Greetings.
-Greetings.
[1654.59] You both are looking so good together.
[1657.48] See, you are getting praised
as well because of me.
[1661.84] Zaid, you should value
your newly wedded bride.
[1666.95] She has gotten old, 
the new bride is inside.
[1672.34] Everyone seems better
than the other tonight.
[1675.64] -I'll just go meet Faiq.
-Yeah, sure.
[1678.23] Greetings, how are you?
[1679.86] Nosheen, you look really good too. 
Just like a bride.
[1702.48] She how expensive the setup is?
[1705.19] Your father has chosen
several kinds of dishes to serve.
[1709.30] He has gone insane 
after his sister and daughter.
[1712.88] Had this been your wedding, he would have
kept reciting the lesson of simplicity.
[1722.28] Why aren't you saying anything?
[1744.34] Faiq, we won't let you go like
this. Aima is our very special cousin,
[1750.52] and to reach her you
will have to pay a price.
[1753.50] Faiq, don't give
them a single paisa.
[1755.58] You know what they’re going
to do? They'll hide your shoe.
[1757.60] It's better that you get a new shoe
after you go home, it will cost you less.
[1761.34] Zaid, Faiq is not a miser like you, right?
[1766.19] -Let's see.
-There you go, you got your answer.
[1769.35] Faiq, the cleric is on his way. 
Are you ready?
[1772.54] -Yes uncle, I'm ready.
-All right. You just take care of him.
[1806.99] What's your problem, Nosheen? 
Why do you keep calling me?
[1809.20] -Faiq, come to me right now.
-Are you insane? I can't come right now.
[1813.66] You have to come. Faiq. If you won't
come right now I am going to kill myself.
[1817.96] Hello, Nosheen?
[1853.02] Nosheen, Nosheen,
what are you doing?
[1858.10] I don't have any other option, Faiq.
[1861.37] Marry me, Faiq. Marry me
or else I'm going to kill myself!
[1865.81] Nosheen, Nosheen, please, look, it's too
late now. You have to accept this reality.
[1872.00] What you are calling a reality is a lie.
[1874.25] The truth is that we both
love each other, Faiq.
[1878.09] And if you won't marry me, 
I'm going to kill myself.
[1881.11] Nosheen, why are you insisting?
[1883.71] I want to live with you, and if you
aren't in my life it's of no use then.
[1889.68] Nosheen.
[1892.98] -Man.
-Who are you looking for, Faiq?
[1896.33] And even if someone arrives, 
what are you going to tell him?
[1899.45] Don't do it, Faiq. There is still time.
Tell everyone that we both love each other.
[1905.40] I'm telling you honestly, you will
never be happy by doing this marriage.
[1909.31] Are you trying to blackmail me, Nosheen?
[1911.76] No, I'm giving you an option.
[1915.00] Like I did before that we should
elope, but you never took me seriously.
[1922.88] But you will have to
take me seriously now.
[1927.40] I wish, I wish you would have listened
to me earlier and we would have eloped.
[1932.54] It wouldn't have
reached to this point then.
[1934.46] But you have always
mocked my love for you.
[1939.24] You have mocked me being so young.
[1942.35] Mother's calling.
[1944.27] Faiq, just listen to me.
Our future is going to be really nice.
[1947.78] You will just have to
show a little courage.
[1949.51] Tell everyone about us. 
I am going to support you, Faiq.
[1965.93] -All right then...
-Nosheen!
[1980.55] Zoya, what's going on? 
Where has everyone gone?
[1986.16] I don't know, they have gone inside.
[1988.30] I think auntie needs to talk to
them about something important.
[1990.73] Okay, just don't worry. It must be
something, I don't know about it right now.
[1995.86] Tell them Faiq how much you love me.
[1998.71] Tell them that you used to come
and meet me by ignoring Aima.
[2001.80] Tell them that we have met
privately at your place and at my place.
[2006.14] I'm not going to let anybody
be unfair to Nosheen.
[2010.54] And Nimra, you were just
talking about asking Faiq, right?
[2013.81] I just met him and he
has admitted it himself
[2016.53] that he wants to marry Nosheen.
[2018.18] I don't care what you want.
[2021.19] If you have fixed your marriage with
Aima, then you have to marry Aima.
