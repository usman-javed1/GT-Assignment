From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you Mother, Nosheen isn't that type of a girl. You are thinking wrong of her. You don't need to tell me
 what kind of a girl she is. I know her very well. She is a very clever and cunning girl, whom I can never respect. Aima, everyone is blaming me. I haven't committed any sin either, Dad, but I am being judged as well. If you will get angry with me too,
where am I going to go? You are the only one who understands me. You are standing here with so much
confidence after disgracing yourself. Don't forget that you
are present in my home. She is your elder. She may be an elder in her house. All her tantrums are because you
have given her so much leverage. Zoya, what have you done to yourself? You know I can't watch you like this. Mom, Zaid told me that he loves me. And not just once, he said it many times. -Zoya, why are you...
-Why did he do this? And Aima, she was my best friend. Even then she deceived me. Get hold of yourself dear.
Don't cry like that. Mom I don't want to
live like this, I just don't. What are you talking
about? May your enemies die. And look, you aren't
going to cry anymore, okay? You won't cry at all. 
You are my strong daughter. Those who brought you to
this condition are going to cry,  they will cry all their lives. No, nothing can be done now. Why not dear? We will take revenge from them. What are you going to do? How
are you going to take revenge? I will file a case on them. I will drag all them to court. Why? They both have married
with each other's consent, is everything going to change
because of your case? Is everything going to
be like it was before? Tell me? No, right? They leave it, nothing is going
to make any difference to me now. Now you should accept
the reality as well that Aima is now Zaid's wife. No, Zoya, how can you give up so easily. Because there is no hope left. They did what they had to do. But no, I won't give up. I am going to destroy everyone's peace. Dad I have called Zoya but
her number is switched off. He is not at Zoya's place I have found
out. He left her place in the morning. Then where is he since morning? Don't know if he has eaten or not. I'm really worried, Dad. God forbid
there might be some emergency with him. Please call his university friends.
Ask them about his whereabouts. I don't feel good. Okay fine, send me friends'
numbers, I'll message them. -Zaid!
-Zaid. Where have you been, Zaid? Zaid, have you eaten anything? 
Are you all right? Where were you?
I was so worried... Dad, what's wrong with him? 
Why isn't he saying anything? He'll be fine, don't worry. -Please talk to him, ask him what's wrong.
-I'll go and see, you sit down. Mom, may I sit here? Are you feeling okay? -Yeah, I'm fine.
-Why didn't you come to have dinner with us? You ate earlier, right? If you know it why are you asking then? I was just confirming. I was thinking that from tomorrow, me and
Faiq are going to eat when you are eating. No need for that. You can eat whenever
you like.  No need to worry about me. What do you mean? 
Why shouldn't we worry? You know, there is
no fun in having food until some elder of the house
accompanies you. And Faiq hasn't eaten properly either. Faiq was telling me that you
like strawberry ice cream a lot. I have made some for you,
with my own hands, please come. Nosheen, stop making these efforts. I didn't get you, Mom? Just take care of your husband.
Keep him happy that's enough for me. Mom, whatever you think, but I won't
let any chance to serve you get away. And I will prove myself
to be your daughter. By the way, you should be thankful that
Aima didn't become your daughter in law. Because if she had become
your daughter in law she would have started fighting
with you within a few days. Nosheen, don't you understand
anything in the first time? I have told you many times that 
I don't need you to know about Aima. I know you and her very well. Go inside, it's too late, go sleep. Fine. Absolutely fine. Don;t worry about your fee Shanawaz. Just make such a case on these
father and son that they get ridiculed. Don't you worry, if Zoya testifies
against the allegations on them  then we may get them arrested too. It's necessary for
them to visit the lockup. -Yeah, Mom, you called me?
-Yeah, come here. Meet him, my lawyer, Mr. Shanawaz. I'm filing a case on Zaid. He is going to come back to his senses
after spending some time in the lock up. What case? Well, he has given you mental
torture right after marriage  and married again without your consent. 00:30:46,127 --> 00:30:51,675
Just read it, sign it and after that sign here as well. Here. What is this? These are your divorce papers. Doesn't matter if Zaid divorces Aima but you won't stay married to him now. Come on, stop thinking and sign it. Sign it, Zoya. I can't. Zoya! Look, it's very important that she is ready
for it, or else we will have a weak case. Don't worry about her,
Shanawaz, I'll convince her. Just carry on with your working. -So are you ready?
-Just give me five minutes, doing last touch up. That's surprising, you said
that twenty minutes ago too. Ha ha ha, you're so funny Zaid. That I am. By the way, Zoya, I wonder why girls spend so much time
in front of the mirror getting ready, just to hear from others that you
look so different today? Zaid, I don;t like these
typical kind of jokes by men. And you know very well
how much I hate them. Specially those related to wives. Okay, it's decided, from now on no such
typical jokes, specially related to wives. Yeah, as if you are that obedient. Do you have any doubts? I'm telling you, Zoya, I will
be a very obedient husband. Really? And when people will call you a
hen-pecked husband what are you going to do then? Well I'm going to feel
proud. I love you, Zoya. Besides, it's nice that
proudly I listen to my own wife, not like others who just
listen to others' wives. Don't even think about it, or else I am going
to do that to you that you will remember. I won't dare. Zoya. Let me
tell you I am too scared of you. You got the remote control
of my life in your hands. I can't even drink water without your consent. You are such a drama queen. I am trying to express
my loyalty to you and you think of it as a drama, 
what's going on. Shall we go now? 
Aren't you getting late now? Let's go. Oh, I forgot to put on perfume. No, no, put that one on, please. -Why?
-Put it on. -This?
-That's my favorite. It smells good. Come on. Zoya. What were you doing? Nothing. Were you trying to message Zaid? Why don't you understand that
that guy doesn't deserve you. And he has to pay for what he has done. And not just him but his whole family. I curse that moment when
you said yes to his proposal. I get angry at myself too why I
didn't stop you why didn't I explain you. I trusted him considering
him as my own blood. Mom, Mom, I was thinking that we
should at least hear Zaid once. Are you insane? -He has deceived you.
-Yeah, he has. But he may have some reason for it. He has compromised you. Whatever the reason may be,
he preferred that reason over you. And I won't let my daughter
become someone's second priority. -But, Mom.
-No ifs and buts. Do as I say. I have to send that boy to the lock up. What did they think? Did they
bring a girl from a beggar's family? That there would be no
one to support that girl? Mom, but he told me before getting married. He told you, not asked you. Whatever, how can we
prove that it's a crime? Besides, marrying someone isn't illegal. What can we prove and what not, 
just leave that to me. I am accusing him of such things that on
their basis he will get arrested for sure. You'll see then, Azmat Hussain's
pride is going to vanish. What accusations? The lawyer is going to tell you all the details.  You will just have to do what he says. Sign these papers. Except for doing a second marriage
Zaid has done nothing wrong with me. Are you going to accuse him falsely? He has tortured you mentally. He has married again right
after getting married to you. Isn't that enough? In return if we put some allegations
on him, what's wrong with that? And remember one thing, Zoya. Even if he begs and falls in your feet, I won't let you go with
him at any cost now. Mom, I know that you are very hurt. But I am not going to accuse Zaid
falsely, nor I am going to let you do it. -Zoya, you...
-Mom, I can understand and that doesn't mean at
all that I want to stay with him. Just leave these divorce
papers here. I'll sign them. I won't ask for your forgiveness. Because they both
haven't let me even able to give a justification
to ask for forgiveness. I haven't come here as
Faiq's mother, Shabana. Rather I am here as your
sister in law and Aima's auntie. I wish I had limited our
relationship to this only. If I had the slightest idea that my
child is going to deceive me like that then believe me I would
have never fixed this marriage. It all depends on fate, sister. I have no complains from you. How can this be, Shabana? I have hurt you. I have shown you a
dream about a beautiful, respectful life for your
daughter and then let you down. Non, sister, you haven't let me down. But I was the one who gave
you my word. I promised you. As I said, don't feel bad about it. I have cleared my heart for everyone. No, Shabana, even if you
forgive me, I can't forgive myself. Greetings, auntie. Greetings. Aima, my dear, please forgive me. Auntie, what are you doing? You are embarrassing me. And look, I have no complains with anybody. I have accepted it as a part of my fate. Dear, honestly I tries a lot but I couldn't take a stand for you. It's all right, auntie. It was just bad timing. We can't do anything about that. This is your greatness  
that you are saying such a thing. Otherwise had it been someone else she
wouldn't have wanted to even see my face. But you guys have honored me. You called me home, sat with me. Please, auntie, it's nothing
like that. You are still my auntie. Shabana, to tell you the truth I
envy your upbringing. I always used to say, and I still say it she is one in a million. Sister, it's not up to
me, it's my God's gift. You are right, no doubt. Sister, what are you doing here right now? Don't you have to prepare
for Faiq's wedding reception? Yes, Shabana they are having
preparations for the wedding reception. But I didn't find it
appropriate to join them. Sister, you should have been there. He is  your son. No Shabana, he hasn't just hurt you guys, he has hurt me a lot too. And the step he has taken for his happiness
only he should celebrate that alone too. No matter what happens, I will never
accept Faiq and Nosheen's marriage. I will neither forgive Faiq nor
myself for what Faiq has done. Auntie, why are you hurting yourself? Because, Aima, I'm Faiq's
mother and I have brought him up. And I am feeling really ashamed over it. He made me realize how my upbringing was,
that I didn't prove to be a good mother. Please, don't worry auntie. -Oh, no, mama didn't even iron it.
-Hey, let me iron it. No, Nosheen it's okay, I'll manage. Faiq it's just a shirt, I'll do it. It'll take just two minutes,
I'll do it, doesn't matter. -I'll do it, Faiq...
-I told you... Aima, I had to get my shirt ironed, so Nosheen... Yeah, I said I should iron it. Auntie sent me for that. Well, then Nosheen can iron it,
please come in we can talk here. I have told you, I am not going
to interfere in your matters.  Do whatever you like. That's what I have come to tell you. I am giving up, and going to talk to her. -But only because of you.
-What? Zaid go because of your sake. Go for Zoya's sake, go for
the sake of your relationship. And please stop fighting like kids and
try to sort out your issues yourselves. -Why don't you say that to her?
-I have told that to her too and I am telling that
to you too once again. Please, please stop fighting. Try to resolve your own problems. I don't know what is going to happen
to you both when I will go to my in laws. We will wait for you to come back so
that we can run our case in your court. Zaid, I need to talk to you. 
Can we sit for a while and talk? Please, Aima, I'm not in a
condition to talk right now. But, Zaid... It would be better if
we don't talk right now. I am in such a situation
right now that I'm hearing something else
and understanding something else. Try to understand. Are you feeling all right?
I'm worried about you. Yes, I am fine. Don't worry about me. Where are you going in such condition. Aima, please, I have
told you to leave me alone. Sir, someone left this for you. -Who left it?
-I don't know, postman left it, said it's on your name. What happened, Zaid? Zaid, tell me what is it? What happened, Zaid, at least tell me. Zaid. We are going to be in a relationship.
You know a life long relationship. -Should I tell you the truth?
-Yeah, I want to know the truth. And what if you don't like it? If I say that I love you
and want to marry you, what will be your response? Tell me what is going to be your response? Will you marry me? It had no effect on his father. He is still being stubborn,
but I won't spare him either. -I'll show him.
-What? What can you do, Mom? Aima, at least someone needs to talk. Look, it's not just him who got effected you have been effected
with brother's decision too. A huge gap has been created
between us after this incident. I think that we should stay
away from each other for a while. Aima is banking on me, you
have expectations from me too. Auntie's health is dependent
on me, but what about me? Does anybody care about me? You want me to be happy
and smile and accept everything as if nothing had happened?
