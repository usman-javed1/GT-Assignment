[0.00] From flowers and from buds
[4.57] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.16] When I saw you
[14.30] I learned to chirp from you
[19.02] That's the reason we
had to postpone our flight.
[23.39] No problem, dear. It's good
as much as you both can enjoy together.
[28.50] Aima, are you happy dear?
[32.79] Yes, a lot.
[34.69] Zoya, Zaid's flight must have landed.
[45.06] What time was his flight?
[48.44] It must have landed at 7 o'clock.
[51.89] but it's 10:30 now.
[54.93] He should have come by now to pick you up.
[57.61] -Listen, Nosheen.
-What now?
[62.19] Actually?
[64.48] can you lend me some money?
[75.98] What happened,Mom? Isn't he picking up?
[78.91] His phone is switched off.
[82.50] Don't worry, there is
still time in your flight.
[117.44] Hello. Yeah, Zaid?
[129.17] Okay.
[135.90] What is it? What was Zaid saying?
[141.37] Zaid isn't coming.
[143.48] His flight got canceled.
[171.82] And who will tell us that you are telling
the truth? Because I don't trust you at all.
[177.92] Here, I have her umber in my phone. Just dial
it and ask her whom I was with today. Dial it.
[188.73] Faiq, whenever a person talks
in anger, he says wrong things.
[195.53] We will sit calmly and talk in detail.
[218.64] Who is calling you this late?
[221.51] Actually, Faiq, it's mama.
[226.59] Is this the time to call?
[228.85] Faiq, she is my mama. She worries
about me that's why she is calling.
[235.32] I know that she is your
mother, but she must know
[238.68] that she is not supposed to call her daughter
at her in laws at this hour. This isn't the way.
[242.24] Faiq, she is my mother.
At least show some respect.
[245.97] I should be the one to show respect,
and nothing implies on you guys?
[250.96] What do you mean by you guys?
[253.47] She is my mother,
why are you dragging her into this?
[256.96] Why shouldn't I drag her?
[260.29] She supports you in your every wrong deed.
[263.43] Wrong deed?
[265.16] What have I done that you are
accusing my mother  too along with me?
[270.58] Nosheen, I am not in a mood
to argue with you at this hour.
[274.59] You are not in a mood to argue,
but you can accuse me?
[280.42] I thought of you as a simple
and naive person.
[285.94] But you have proved yourself
to be completely opposite.
[288.66] So now you know how I am.
[292.30] Now just stop this nonsense,
and I'm going to bed.
[295.23] You are talking nonsense yourself
and the taunting me?
[301.47] And your mother feels proud
on this upbringing of hers.
[304.59] Don't you dare say a word
against my mother, understood?
[308.15] Really, not a single word
against your mother,
[310.93] and what about the things you
are saying against my mother?
[313.37] Nosheen, just shut your mouth, or else...
[315.80] Or else?
[317.65] Or else I am going to drop you off
to your mother's, got it?
[350.03] Zaid, I know you must be
very worried right now.
[354.32] I tried my best to get another flight.
[358.23] But due to bad weather we
are unable to get any other flight.
[364.27] Your trip has been canceled twice.
[367.22] May be there is God's wisdom behind it.
[373.18] You'll see, whenever you guys are going to go
this time, you will have a great experience.
[381.33] I'm sorry, Zaid.
[383.27] Had I known that this visit
is going to prolong this much,
[389.03] you and Zoya will have so much issues,
[391.98] then I would have come
with the office team.
[394.13] Why are you saying sorry?
It's not your fault in all this.
[399.69] In fact, it's no one is fault.
[405.14] But who can explain this to Zoya now?
[412.82] Both the reasons are genuine. If you will explain
her calmly, she will understand it for sure.
[418.93] It's not that easy, Aima.
[420.91] I'm sure she is going to
raise a big issue on this too.
[424.78] Zaid, why are you
assuming all this yourself?
[429.43] She isn't that stupid.
[433.08] No, Aima, you have no idea.
She has been very stubborn lately.
[438.94] She considers my every justification
just as an excuse.
[445.27] She doesn't understand anything I say.
[447.83] Look, what's done is done.
[452.34] I am sure that if you try to explain her
calmly, she is going to understand it for sure.
[457.45] She is Zoya,
[460.34] not you who cooperates
with me on everything.
[463.49] I know how to appease her.
[467.74] Just put yourself in her place.
[470.21] Her plan has been canceled twice.
She ought to get angry then.
[479.25] She must have so many desires,
to travel with you.
[482.49] She must have had so many plans.
[487.12] She is going through a difficult time.
[490.80] -I just don't want to talk to her.
-Zaid, please.
[494.63] Please, just solve this issue now.
[497.83] Why do I have to appease her every time.
[499.38] It's been so many days did
she message me even once?
[501.89] You both are alike, stubborn.
[505.59] You both don't agree to anything easily.
[507.96] Even after I have told you so many
times, you haven't called her either.
[512.24] Look, now when we'll go back,
just end the tension between you two.
[517.64] Don't prolong it.
[521.08] Okay?
[535.81] Mom, I wanted to tell you
that I have got an offer.
[541.10] They were asking me from some
time, so I'm going on their shoot.
[546.09] Very good, you have done a great thing.
[550.80] I'm thinking to start work properly.
[555.31] I'm very happy for you. Very good decision.
[559.46] When will you be back?
[561.40] I have no idea. I might get a little late.
[564.98] -But I'll inform you.
-It's okay.
[570.01] -Okay, Mom, I'll get going now.
-Listen, just don't worry.
[577.59] What for?
[580.22] I will get your flight rescheduled.
[585.10] There is no need for that.
Just cancel this trip, please.
[589.16] Zoya, Zaid has no fault in
whatever happened this time.
[593.99] -It was just due to bad weather...
-I told you, Mom.
[596.75] There is no need for that. Besides,
our money doesn't grow on trees.
[603.04] You earn it with a lot of hard work.
[605.09] Don't worry, dear.
[607.05] I can spend as much money as
required for my daughter’s happiness.
[612.79] I know, that's why I am
saying it because I want it.
[616.70] I don't want to go anywhere.
[618.85] Just get this trip canceled.
[629.20] First tell me, why did you
come without telling me?
[633.67] So now you are going
to accuse me when it's your fault.
[639.02] First you tell me, where did you go without
telling your husband and mother in law.
[644.38] That's not your problem.
[645.85] Oh, so it's your problem. Okay then
solve it yourself. Why did you call me?
[650.71] The problem wasn't with me going out.
[654.20] The issue was created when you
came without informing, understand?
[657.33] May God never give anyone a daughter like
you. I just came to give you a surprise.
[662.85] -And you are...
-To hell with your lame surprise.
[666.13] -What is wrong with you, Nosheen?
-I have lost my mind.
[670.86] My life wasn't that beautiful as is,
[672.61] and it has turned even more
difficult because of your stupidity.
[675.95] Not because of my stupidity, Nosheen.
[678.39] You are ruining your life because of
your own deeds, just remember that.
[683.66] Enough now, I don't want
to hear your advice.
[686.09] This is all is the result
of not listening to my advice, Nosheen.
[688.96] Just stop your nonsense. You got me
caught and then you are scolding me too.
[692.99] Rather than accepting your
mistake, you are cursing me.
[698.48] I handled things with so
much difficulty the other day.
[701.69] You know how embarrassed I got in
front of your mother law and your husband?
[705.17] What difference did it make
even after you handled thing?
[707.40] And that crazy man,
it's not like he spared me.
[712.72] And that old woman,
she is such a drama queen.
[715.57] She was pretending in front
of Faiq talk to to me politely.
[719.88] Talk slowly, someone might hear.
Are you completely out of your mind?
[726.85] If your mother in law hears it,
a new drama is going to start.
[730.32] To hell with that old woman.
Such a drama queen.
[734.45] Oh, God, give this girl some sense.
[736.46] Nosheen, please, control yourself and your behavior
or else there is going to be a huge problem.
[742.01] There is a problem already.
What else can be that bad?
[744.87] Nosheen, please,
this can create a huge problem.
[749.11] So please try to understand.
[754.03] He has just slapped you right now.
He might kick you out of his home too.
[757.73] -I'm warning you.
-Are you on his side or mine?
[763.65] Nosheen, I'm on your side, that's
why I am trying to explain you.
[767.65] Oh, thank you so much that you took
my side and gave me so much advice.
[772.19] Nosheen, just shut your mouth, and don't
you dare do anything that Faiq dislikes.
[779.91] Okay, anything else?
[781.75] And, Nosheen, listen. Go and
apologize to Faiq. He is your husband.
[785.87] Apology and me? No chance.
[788.77] Do whatever you want, but
listen to one thing carefully,
[792.63] if you get kicked out of that house, your father
is not going to let you enter in this house,
[797.98] Okay, I don't care.
[800.50] Hello? Hello? Oh! This girl is going
to get me a heart failure one day.
[823.23] -So, shoot wrap up?
-Yeah it's a wrap.
[825.62] -Okay.
-Today's shoot was wonderful.
[829.09] -Thank you.
-Let me order some coffee for you.
[831.71] All right.
[833.98] And Boss has called you to his office.
[837.82] -Right now?
-Yeah.
[841.72] Okay, fine, send my coffee there then.
[845.75] Okay, I'll send it.
[858.98] Nosheen.
[861.32] Nosheen, have your lunch.
[865.45] Eat something, you haven't
eaten since last night.
[883.69] If a person is not opening the door,
this means that he doesn't want to talk.
[889.34] But I haven’t come to talk.
I have just brought lunch.
[894.14] I don't want to have lunch.
Just leave me alone.
[904.13] Nosheen I know what you are going through.
[908.08] Really? You must be very happy then.
[912.09] Why do you always
think that I'm your enemy?
[916.27] Because I know very well
whatever you are doing with me.
[919.66] I am not stupid.
[921.73] What do you mean?
[923.45] When have I been unfair to you?
[927.75] If I have taken away any right of yours,
or been cruel to you then let me know.
[933.60] You hate me.
[939.09] You want that Faiq leaves me, and if he
keeps me then he should just confine me.
[943.75] Because you feel good seeing me like that.
[947.99] I don't understand how
can you even think of all this?
[954.51] You can tell that. I think you want
your own blood to come in this house.
[963.00] Nosheen, a marriage is done
once only, not again and again.
[971.21] And you have to fulfill it all your life.
[975.68] This isn't a drama going
on that I am going to conspire
[978.83] and play tricks and plan
to get you out of this house.
[983.19] Wow, you say such nice things.
[988.58] But remember one thing, that Faiq's
behavior with me is just because of you.
[994.02] You poison him against me.
[997.24] I have no answer to your mistrust.
[1001.77] I just want to tell you that it gives
me no pleasure when you both fight.
[1009.59] Instead it hurts me.
[1011.92] And I am not even from those mothers
who get their daughter in laws tortured
[1015.90] and make their son's life
miserable and restless.
[1025.88] Okay, I'll try to explain Faiq.
[1028.44] But please, try that this
doesn't happen again.
[1033.17] It would be better that you explain him.
[1036.00] Because next time,
I won't stand still after getting hit.
[1039.23] I know how to respond as well.
[1043.73] It would be better that instead of taking
revenge you get to the root cause of this fight.
[1052.65] And try to take responsibility
of your marriage.
[1056.50] The day you will start changing
[1059.43] you'll see how good your
married life is going to be.
[1064.44] Okay, fine, I will try.
[1068.24] Okay now have your lunch.
[1093.90] -This is my own office, Zoya.
-Yes, I know that.
[1098.38] So how did your shoot go?
[1100.54] It was good. Besides I always
feel good working with your agency.
[1106.65] Actually there is something 
for which I have called you.
[1111.98] The client has really liked 
our Dubai shoot.
[1118.53] Because of which, I have
discussed it with my team as well,
[1121.77] we would like to make a contract with you.
[1127.02] -Do you want to same something?
-Yes.
[1132.74] Uncle that's why I wanted
to take your permission.
[1140.59] I like it, Zoya, that you 
asked for my permission.
[1148.01] You are the elder of this house.
[1150.71] And had my dad been alive today,
[1155.76] then I would have asked 
for his permission too.
[1160.65] Sorry, it's nothing, 
I was just listening to you.
[1167.46] The thing is that the contract 
will be of two years.
[1173.02] And you won't be able to work for
any other agency other than ours.
[1178.77] So, do I have to decide it right now?
[1183.68] No, don't make a decision right now.
You may discuss it with your family.
[1187.90] And then take a decision.
[1194.94] And if I want to have the contract
right now, I mean is it ready yet?
[1202.87] We have the contract ready with us, we'll
just have to print your name on it. What else.
[1214.16] Okay, then just get 
the contract. I'll sign it.
[1218.55] Okay, I will get the contract. 
So should I consider it a deal?
[1223.90] -Deal done.
-Done.
[1277.38] That boor.
[1284.43] Nosheen, please listen to me. 
Seriously, Nosheen, I need you.
[1295.98] Nosheen, I just need 
a hundred thousand rupees.
[1298.88] I promise you I am going to return all your
money. Just help me this time, please help me.
[1319.73] I will only give poison to him.
[1340.09] I have been calling you both for past one
hour. Why was your phone switched off?
[1343.90] Dad, actually for some reason both our phones
stopped working, I think due to moisture.
[1349.59] We can't tell you 
how difficult it was for us.
[1351.39] Oh, God! Anyway, not an issue. 
Get a new one.
[1356.24] By the way, Dad, you didn't
ask us about the meeting.
[1360.62] Why should I ask when I already know?
[1365.20] -What do you mean?
-What do you mean?
[1366.79] Make a guess.
[1368.36] Did you get any email?
[1374.69] Dad, tell us now.
[1376.62] Yes, we have got the contract.
[1382.43] -Wow, that's great news.
-Yes, exactly.
[1387.56] Thank God.
[1389.84] Congrats, Dad.
[1391.47] You both already had an idea, don't you?
[1394.14] Honestly, Dad, we had an idea but we wanted
that you get to know it from them directly.
[1397.85] Wow, how direct. 
You both are too secretive.
[1402.62] I mean you didn't let me have 
any idea before.
[1405.46] Dad, this was Zaid's idea. He thought it should
be confirmed first then he should tell you.
[1416.60] The good thing is that the
reason for which you both went,
[1421.34] you came back successful
by the grace of God.
[1426.48] You are absolutely right. 
I am really proud of my kids today.
[1431.51] To tell you the truth, 
more credit goes to Aima.
[1435.47] The way she gave satisfactory
answers to their queries,
[1438.74] honestly had it been just me, 
I couldn't have handled it that way.
[1442.36] It's nothing like that, 
Zaid has worked as hard as I did.
[1447.64] That's nice. It's both your achievement.
[1453.78] Brother, just sweets won't do. 
You will have to throw a party.
[1458.54] What do you say kids?
[1460.68] Why not.
[1462.04] That's understood. There is going to be a party,
a very grand party and that too from my side.
[1469.36] I think you guys should go rest now.
[1472.19] Yes, take rest.
[1474.69] I will take care of some chores too.
[1478.25] I'll join you too.
[1486.62] Okay, Dad, I will leave too.
[1488.89] Wait a second, I have to talk to you.
[1493.28] Sure, go ahead.
[1496.63] Really, thank you very much, dear.
[1500.16] Dad, strangers are supposed to be thanked,
[1504.28] and I did it for my own company. 
So, please don't embarrass me.
[1508.44] No, I'm not talking about that.
[1513.53] -Oh, you are...
-You didn't let me down, son.
[1519.43] And this means a lot to me.
[1521.68] I'm talking about Aima.
[1524.24] I can tell by looking 
at the joy on her face
[1526.69] that you listened to
me and treated her well.
[1532.52] For that I have to say thank you to you.
[1537.75] I know that that girl deserves your love.
[1544.32] Really love you and thank you, 
and I'm proud of you, dear.
[1548.09] -Proud of you.
-Thank you, Dad.
[1550.57] Take rest. Thank you.
[1572.10] What is this? I didn't ask for any tea.
[1574.90] Faiq, I thought you might like it,
that's why I made sandwiches with tea.
[1579.56] Nosheen, at least you should
have asked. I don't feel like eating.
[1583.40] So what, you can have at least
this much with tea.
[1588.01] Please, don't force me. 
I told you I'm not in the mood.
[1596.56] You are not in the mood? Can't you
eat it just to make your wife happy?
[1601.68] Nosheen, I had a late lunch, 
in fact I had it at 4:00 pm.
[1607.83] And then I had coffee. 
So I can't have it right now.
[1610.92] So, why did you had your lunch late? 
Any specific reason?
[1614.81] Now you will be after it 
that why I had a late lunch.
[1617.62] Faiq, I'm your wife.
[1622.76] I must know about what you are
eating at what time and with whom.
[1628.40] Oh, so you want to know 
who I had my lunch with.
[1631.86] Obviously, I should be aware.
[1638.30] One can not trust husbands these days.
[1641.34] Don't know who they roam
around with when they go out.
[1645.61] We can't get a tracker installed in them.
[1647.97] One can't even trust 
the wives these days either.
[1652.24] Then should all the husbands
should install tracker in them too?
[1655.79] Why are you prolonging it so much?
[1658.91] Right now I am doing something
very important, so go from here, please.
[1664.81] And take all this away too.
[1688.28] Zafar, what are you doing?
[1689.82] Why don't you tell the gardener to work
properly? Look at the plants and the grass.
[1693.24] And why aren't the lights 
still not repaired?
[1695.77] Neither the fountain is repaired.
[1697.39] Call the electrician 
I'll talk to him myself.
[1699.76] Are you happy now?
[1702.31] You can go, Zafar.
[1705.23] What's wrong, dear?
[1706.94] I went to give sandwiches to
your son because you asked me to.
[1709.97] Didn't he eat them?
[1711.64] He didn't even eat them 
and insulted me as well.
[1714.39] Really?
[1717.21] I don't think what your son
thinks of himself.
[1719.57] It's like as if he has got a license
to insult me because I married him.
[1723.93] No, Nosheen, he isn't like that.
[1726.54] Just leave it, auntie. He is your
son, you will think good of him.
[1730.54] Everyone likes their children.
[1732.69] He is angry right now, 
that's why he is doing all this.
[1738.60] What is it that I have done
[1744.31] that his anger isn't ending?
[1746.65] Then go and try to appease him.
[1751.39] This way the bitterness
between you two will end.
[1754.46] Auntie, I have never tolerated
such tantrums even by my father.
[1760.14] Dear, a father doesn't show tantrums,
in fact he bears his daughter's tantrums.
[1765.05] And there is a lot of difference
between a father and a husband.
[1770.12] Daughters are their father's darlings.
[1773.07] But you have to work really hard 
to win your husband's heart.
[1777.24] Just leave it, now don't
you start lecturing me.
[1780.73] My tantrums were never
borne by my father, and
[1783.19] neither my husband does
it even after getting married.
[1788.05] I don't know who are such clever girls
[1790.97] who control their father and brother,
[1793.53] and after getting married
they control their husbands too.
[1799.33] By the way I know such a clever girl.
[1802.35] Those are not clever 
rather very wise girls.
[1809.29] Because they have an idea 
how to manage their homes.
[1816.75] And they know very well that the
man of the house needs peace only
[1820.58] that they provide them to the fullest.
[1822.87] Keep one thing in mind, auntie.
[1827.76] And tell that to your son as well.
[1830.00] that you shouldn't think that if you
kick me out, I'll be on the streets.
[1834.72] I still have a home and I can go there.
[1839.48] I just don't understand, Nosheen, 
why do you think like that?
[1843.13] This is your home and it will always be.
Nobody wants to kick you out from here.
[1847.46] I want that you and Faiq
always stay happy here.
[1851.44] Just forget it auntie, there is a lot of
difference between saying and doing.
[1879.36] Okay, hold on.
[1883.76] Mom and me were waiting 
for you over dinner.
[1889.41] Okay, you guys start, I'll join you.
[1894.11] Look, Zaid, it's very simple.
[1896.58] Just tell me who do you want
in your life. Aima or me?
[1901.30] And if you can't leave Aima 
then you should divorce me.
[1905.46] For God's sake, tell them to
have some mercy on my daughter.
[1910.90] Yes, of course sister, now
that you have talked to me
[1914.70] I will talk to sister
Nimra about it for sure.
[1916.92] And if necessary I will talk to Faiq too.
[1919.90] Nosheen, trust me dear.
[1922.48] Don't you dare call me dear. 
I am not dear to you.
