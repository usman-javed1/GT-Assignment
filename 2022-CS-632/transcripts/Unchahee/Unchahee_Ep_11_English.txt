From flowers and from buds I have learnt to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learnt how to chirp from you I love you, Aima. You cheap man, if you
contact me ever again, then I swear I am going
to involve the police, understood? When I told you not to discuss it,
why did you do it then? -Discuss what?
-The one with Auntie and Nosheen. What happened? Dad, are you okay? Dad... Dad? Aima, get some water. -I think, are you getting a heart attack?
-Dad? -What's going on, Nosheen?
-What, Mama? There is something going on
that only you know, or else you won't have been
sitting here so peacefully. There can be something or nothing. Don't make me guess riddles, Nosheen,
tell me honestly. Mama, Why don't you trust me?
It's a good news. If it's such a good news,
then why don't you tell me? As it is your father isn't talking at all. You fool, tell me what is it? Mom, I think you are forgetting, ours
and dad's happiness is not the same. Till when will you keep me guessing,
just tell me, Nosheen. Mom, the fruit of patience is sweet. Let the fruit ripen properly, we'll eat
it after that slowly and enjoy it. Now, if you are going to eat an unripe
fruit, then it's sourness would taste bad. Don't try to become my mother.
Are you telling me or should I smack you? Oh, Mama, my, Mama, why
are you getting angry? When I'll tell you the whole story then instead of smacking me,
you are going to clap for me. Just stop praising
yourself now and tell me. Well, the story is that your sister-in-law's daughter
went to meet a boy. Aima? You know, affair,
girlfriend-boyfriend things. What happened then? What happened then was
that someone was already there, who took their photos. What are you talking about? And photos are as such, that the mythical
lovers Heer and Ranjha would fail too  in front of Aima and that boy. Then what? Well coincidently that guy
found dad's number, and he forwarded the photos to dad. And after looking at the photos, all the reality of her favourite
got revealed in front of him. How did all this happen, Nosheen? Just have the fruit not the basket. How did you play this trick, Nosheen? Mama, I didn't play this trick, time did. You know well that time
doesn't remain the same. It's in favour of someone at one point,
 and of the other at another. You didn't finish your dinner? Yes, I got so worried, Mother. And then, dad had left too,
who would have eaten without him. There must be some issue at work. Don't worry. Brother is a successful man. And there are a hundred evil eyes
after a successful man. But I know that brother knows
how to solve every issue. You are right, but... dad has never reacted this way. Dear, with time a person's nerves weaken. It's not the same as earlier. God has done better for us in the past. We should expect Him to do better
for us in future as well. Besides, I keep praying
for everyone in the house  that may God keep them safe. We should expect good from God. Yes mother. -Dad, dad how are you feeling now?
-Shabana, I have to talk to you in private. Aima, go away. Mother... Sure, please sit, brother. Everything all right? What do you think, why is dad so worried? I don't know but it's definitely
something big. because dad is not one of those
who get worried so easily. I got really scared. I gave dad the glass of water,
he refused to take it. He has never done this to me before. Calm down, Aima. He must have done it because he was tensed.
He would never do it intentionally. Zaid, please go and ask him what his wrong. What is it that he got to know
in his messages, which made him so worried. You know well that when he is worried
he doesn't talk to anyone. He asked mother and Nosheen
to go away from his room as well. But I am sure that if you go talk
to him, then he will let you know because he never says no to you. No, I don't want to go to dad right now. Why? Because... because I think
we should leave him alone right now. I don't want to disturb him. I hope it is something
related to the house. Because he never shares
anything related to business. But if it's a domestic issue
he will tell us. -So, is it regarding his business...
-Honestly, I have no idea. I don't know what message he got
that made him so worried. Phone... that reminds me,
where is dad's phone? Nosheen might have picked it up. Dad forgot
it on the dining table when he left. Right. Now, we can just wait that dad comes out of his room
and tells us what is wrong. Aima, all the pictures that I have
of yours are edited by me. All of them are fake, edited. Besides, I am not going
to send your pictures to anyone. I don't have the contact
of any of your family member. Delete them in front of me. Right now. Such a huge thing has happened
and your dad is sitting quietly in his room. I get really scared of his silence. Mom, those who are guilty should be scared. Just stay calm, besides the reality will be
revealed in front of everyone eventually. Your dad knows well how to keep a secret, it might be possible that
he just doesn't reveal it  and no one ever gets to know about it. I won't let that happen,
the damage is done all ready. When he caught you, he announced it everywhere that
my daughter won't continue her studies. This is how your dad is. It's been hours
and he hasn't uttered a word until now. He cares about his niece
 more than her daughter. Mama, I am more furious than you
on these mother and daughter. How can I forget, how much humiliation
I had to face because of them. She stabbed me in the back
in the name of friendship. Don't worry. I won't let Shabana
raise her head after this. She was so proud of her
daughter being so naive. You'll see how I am going
to humiliate her all the time. Get ready then, because dad went
to their room just now. He must have shown the wrong doings
of his favourite one to auntie. We have started this game, and your dad shouldn't
get out of our influence now. Excuse me, Mama, out of my influence. I was the master mind of this game, so everyone is going
to do what I say, including you. You fool, I have given birth to you. What's so different about that?
As if you had another choice. Pride must have a fall. Just don't do anything in your pride that all this game that you have
setup goes to waste. Okay, Nosheen? I know what I'm doing, Mom. I thought that he wanted something else. I thought he wanted you
to get married to Zaid. Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that Mother... Has dad said anything to you? I don't understand, what's wrong with brother? He has never talked to me
 in this gruff tone before. -Has he said something about me to you?
-Yes. He has told me that... whatever proposals there are for Aima think
over them and whichever you find suitable get Aima married there as soon as possible. Before today whenever your
marriage was discussed, brother always told me to let
you finish your studies first. I thought that he was
thinking of something else. I thought, may be he wanted you
to get married to Zaid. But today, suddenly, brother said this to me. I... I don't get it. -Aima, Aima?
-Yes? Yes, yes, Mother? What's wrong? What are you thinking? Nothing. Then why is your face turning pale? Just... just like that. Go, have your dinner. You know
that you get sick if you stay hungry. I'm not hungry right now. I will eat when I... I'm hungry. Aima, dear... dear, tell me have you committed any mistake? What I was fearing has happened . He sent dad my pictures. Oh, God! What shall I do? How am I going to prove
in front of dad that I am innocent. How am I going to regain
my place in his eyes? I just don't understand. Hello, Aima. I have been calling you
for so long, why weren't you picking up? Zoya, can you please come to me? I need you. What's wrong, are you all right? No, Zoya. Please come to me. My heart is sinking being alone. Okay, I'm coming, I'm coming. Zaid, where are you, please pick my call. What's wrong, sister? Everything all right? What should I tell you? There is so
much sensational going on in the house. Oh, sister, please don't do anything that
bother Azmat gets angry with you again. We are all fine, it's our enemies
who have lost their senses. Why? What happened?  He has no reason now to get angry on us. Oh, why are you creating suspense?
 Just tell me. Well, something has happened through
which my oldest wounds have been healed. It's no fun telling all this
over the phone. Come to my home. Oh, you should have called
five minutes earlier, Zoya has just left for your house. -Zoya is coming to our house?
-Yes she is, don't you know? No, anyway, you too come over,
as soon as possible. Okay, I'll see. I will come to your place
after getting off from work tomorrow. -Goodbye.
-Okay, good bye. Aima, this can't be, it must be
some other matter. Zoya, al the signs are clear. He has sent my pictures to dad. Looking at which, dad got sad. And he asked mother to get me married
as soon as possible. But, Aima, you said yourself that he is
some random guy, why would he do this then? Yes he was. I don't understand his motive
of doing all this. Zoya... Zoya,  What if dad won't believe me? What if he proves in front of dad that
I went to meet him alone at his flat? -I will lose all respect in dad's eyes.
-Aima, Aima... Aima, calm down, calm down. Wait a second, listen.
Listen to me, look here. Listen to me. Look, don't worry,
we'll think of something, okay? And, did you talk to Zaid about it? Aima, are you serious?
 What were you thinking? I told you to take him into confidence. Now, Zaid knows nothing about it,
what if uncle asks him anything? Where is Zaid right now? Talk to him. I have called him many times,
couldn't get through. I just don't get why this person
is doing all this? Okay, listen. Listen to me
with a cool mind, okay? If he wanted to blackmail you, he
would have asked for money from you, right? But he just met you,
so maybe he just wanted to meet you. I don't think there is any enmity. Yes, it's possible that he isn't my enemy. But it is possible that someone else
might be using him for their enmity. -Who?
-I have no idea. Zoya, I don't understand anything. Okay, enough, enough. Enough, enough. -Dad.
-Hmm? Why are you so worried? I know you are always worried about me.  But I am better now. I'm fine. But we should know, Dad, what is it which made you so sad? Yes, there is an issue. But some things are for elders to deal with. It's better that you don't
take any interest in it. Dad, what if I tell you that I know
what this matter is? Do you remember, Dad? When you left your
phone on the table, I gave it back to you. I have seen everything, Dad.
And I know why you are worried. Dad I think this is the first time when I am looking you in the eye
while talking. And why is that? Because the reason why I was
 humiliated and belittled, and the girl whom you made my role model she has done something worse than I did. I told you earlier as well, wrong
remains wrong no matter who does it. And these are your words too, Dad, that,
"I consider you and Aima as equal." Where is that equality now? Why haven't you gone to her university
yet, to get her admission cancelled? Why haven't you put
any restrictions on her? Why aren't you looking
for proposals for her? I did go to Shabana to talk about it. Where did your equality go
 in this matter, Dad? You humiliated me and mama so much. The whole house was echoing of your
voice when you were humiliating us. And today? Today your silence
 is saying something else, Dad. Quiet. Stay quiet. Don't you have any manners? I am your father, how are you supposed
to talk to me? Do you have an idea? No, Dad, not today. I know that I am ill-mannered
and I know the reason for that as well. And Aima has shown you her real face. She has shown you that we both
are such girls that you don't like. -What do you want?
-Justice. Equality, Dad. You are a man of your words. Then you can't get
a better chance than this, Dad. Greetings, Dad. Shall we go? -Yes, let's...
-No! You are going to go
to the university alone from now on. Aima won't go. Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that. Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that. Come on, hurry up, we are getting late. -Greetings, Dad.
-Greetings, didn't you go yet? I was just leaving, I was waiting
for Aima, and here she is. -Greetings, Dad. Shall we leave?
-Yes, let's... No! You are going to go alone
to the university. Aima won't go. Dad, can I talk to you for a while? No,you can't. But, Dad... I told you, I am not in a mood
to talk right now, go from here. It's a request, Dad.
Just listen to me for two minutes. Dad, why have you stopped Aima
from going to the university? I think you are not old enough
that I am answerable to you. No, Dad, I didn't mean it that way. It's just that, it's a
very important day. It's the last date for
our report submission. It's really important for us to go. If it's so important then you may go. -Dad, what has happened?
-I said what I had to. Dad, you wanted me
to take interest in domestic issues. Now that I am asking you that
what is going on at home  then you aren't telling me. Look, son, I want you
to take interest in domestic issues, But I don't want you
to ask questions from me. Secondly, I don't say anything
for no reason? I think you are getting late. Go now. Aima. Aima what is it? Why are you crying? I don't understand what is wrong?
Why would dad do that? All this drama had to be today. After the due date, either sir won't accept
the the assignment, or he will deduct marks
because of late submission. Aima, do you know why dad is stopping
you from going to the university? Zaid, you just talked to dad,
what did he say? He didn't give me a proper answer,
rather he scolded and sent me away. He was saying,
"Don't question my decisions." Aima, may be
he didn't like something that you did. And may be he has stopped you from going
to the university for the time being. Okay, please don't worry, I will meet the teacher personally and
submit your assignment, don't worry. -I am not crying because of that.
-Then what? I am crying because dad is angry with me. -Zaid, he has never been angry with me.
-That's true. In fact he has never scolded you even. Dad... dad is angry with me. I... I feel like I am going
to stop breathing. I just don't understand. Then why don't you just go
and say sorry to him. I mean, did you misbehave with him? Did you deny something
what he asked you to do? Did you  made auntie angry? Then why would dad be angry
with you for no reason? There must be some reason. Are... are you aware of the reason? Aima, have you committed any mistake? Zaid... I... I... I... I have committed a huge mistake. Nosheen, is this the time to sleep? Mama, don't scold me.
I slept peacefully after so long. Why is that? Because I paid everything back last night. To Aima? No, I will pay her back
once I get a chance. I went to dad last night. What did you guys talk about? -There was no talking, just rebuked.
-Your Dad? No it was my turn this time. By the way, what you
anticipated was right. What? Dad was completely in a mood to hide everything what his
favourite one did and sit quietly. I had an idea. I am well aware
of Azmat's nature. But I have tightened the screws
in such a way that  dad will be enraged
because of his honour. So, that's the reason. Is Aima at home today? She went crying into her room. I am
sure Azmat must have stopped her. Thank God, she is done with the university. By the way, what do you think of me now? I must admit, Nosheen. No one in my previous seven generations
could have been as sharp as you are. Something that I couldn't do all my life,
you did it so swiftly, Nosheen. Oh, my God! I would have also made these mother-daughter
duo dance on my tune as well, but I was never to shut Azmat up ever. Whenever I say something,
Azmat loses his temper. I have made such an arrangement
that he is going to stay quiet now. The game which you have played,
heads is ours and tails is ours too. Now you'll see how Azmat
gets straightened like an arrow. Mama, whoever messes
with us is going to bite the dust. I am just waiting for what
is going to happen next? Just a few people know that right now. This thing is going to be a slap
on every one of his loyal people. I am thinking, Mama,
that I should nab one of them today. Where you have waited so long,
wait for a little longer. If you'll get involved
then someone might doubt you. Me? How will someone doubt me, Mama? I am a naive girl,
who stays within the house. I have no connection from the outside
world. I don't even have a phone. Okay, now stop being a drama queen.
Just have some patience. Let your father reveal what has happened.
You can do whatever you want after that. or else your impatience might ruin the whole game
that you have played, Nosheen. You are right. Aima, so much has happened and you
didn't even bother to inform me? That cheap person kept torturing
you, and blackmailing you, and you just kept hiding it from me?
Till when were you planning to hide it? Zaid, I didn't intend to hide it from you. Whatever the reason is, Aima, there is just one justification for it
and that is that you don't trust me. I have no importance in your life. It's nothing like that, Zaid.
Please try to understand. Such a huge thing happened and even
Zoya didn't let me know about it? I kept asking you both
over and over again to please tell me what is
the problem, share with me, And every time you guys avoided answering
it by talking about something else, as if I were a kid. As if you were
avoiding something a kid is asking. In such situations one even asks for help from a random
person, some relative or a friend even. You didn't think me worthy enough
that I could give you any sort of help. Ridiculous. Zaid, it's not like that,
you have misunderstood. I have understood everything. I am just not worth it in yours and Zoya's
eyes to be trusted even a little bit. Sometimes I think that I am just there
to pick and drop you guys in your lives. I tell you my secrets so that you guys
can laugh on them behind my back. Zaid... Zaid what are you talking about? You are misunderstanding us. Yes, Aima, you are absolutely right. I have been misunderstanding
you both before today. You know what, Aima,
I thought of our friendship matchless. But it all was a lie, a deception. No, Zaid, we are the same as we were. It's just me, I committed a mistake. May be yours and Zoya's friendship is
matchless, I am not part of it anymore. Zaid, please.
Please, just listen to me once. No, Aima, please. It's okay, I understand. If you think you can handle
all your problems yourself -that's good for you then.
-Zaid, just listen to me. I need you. The sorrow which I have draped myself with My body burns because of it I have watched the flames burning So I learned how to burn Why did I get unwanted Nobody knows that Why did I get unwanted Nobody knows that Aima, were you crying? No, I wasn't. Did anybody say something to you?
Sister or Nosheen? Zaid, I am not Aima,
so behave yourself, okay? Then don't listen, go from here. I am a savage person,
I start beating up people walking by. It's not like that, Zaid. Yes, I knew about your character. But I can't support you here
because I was not aware of anything. You called him yourself.
You went to meet him at his flat as well. For all I know, you might be having
an affair with him too.
