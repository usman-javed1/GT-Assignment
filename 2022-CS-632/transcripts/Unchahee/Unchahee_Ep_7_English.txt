From flowers and from buds I have learnt to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you {\an8}I learnt how to chirp from you Marrying someone with my own will is my
right and it's your responsibility... I just stopped myself before hitting you
today, don't you dare say that again. Or else I won't stop then, understand? Have you ever asked Nosheen, where she goes, when she
goes and why she goes? Your dad isn't even ready
to hire him as a peon. Duh, just because his shop
turned to a factory in fluke, {\an8}he thinks everyone else is a peon? {\an8}Behave yourself, Nosheen, he is your dad. Well, I am her daughter as well. Tell him if it isn't Faisal,
there is going to be no one else. Are you in your senses, Nosheen? I am in my senses, but bringing others
to their senses these days. Just listen to me with a cool mind. May be the family that's coming today
 are people like you wanted. I am not interested
 in the family but Faisal. What do I have to do with the family? Dear, everything has got
 to do with the family. Guys do what their family
teaches them to do. Mother, don't confuse me
with useless things. I am sure dad would like
someone rigid like himself. Then how should I tell you to get serious? I'm very serious, Mother,
but with Faisal only. You will lose all this seriousness
if I'll slap you twice. Okay, it's final now. They are coming
 in the evening. Behave yourself. And if your dad and I like them,
then we will fix your marriage. It might be possible
that you guys like them, but what if they don't like
me for any reason, then? Nosheen, you are so adamant and stubborn. Oh, God, what sin
 am I being punished for, in your form. Don't know what sort of an upstart
he is for whom you are fighting so much. -Mother, show a little respect please.
-Oh, showing us how to respect. You don't respect your own father
and telling to respect me some stranger? Faisal isn't some stranger, we know
each other since a year, and I love him. Had he been so crazy after you,
he would have sent you a proposal by now. He is ready. How much does he earn, how is his family, how are the people, one has
to check all these things. He is still studying, and I don't know
about the family. They must be good. -Show me his picture.
-Give me your phone, I'll show you. For God's sake, my ill fate is just like
his hideous picture. Mother, I haven't asked you to criticize. Just get ready. I am going to support
your dad in whatever decision he takes. I am enough for myself. -Don't you like Kinza either?
- No. Well I thought you won't because
Zoya doesn't like her that much. And whenever I mention her,
why do you make a long face? No... it's nothing like that. Neither I like her, nor I find her bad. Okay tell me, how do you find
our chemistry, you know, as a couple? I am asking you because those who are
in love, everything seems perfect to them. So, at times it's important
to take an outsider's opinion. Aima. Aima, dear... Oh, God... -Aima.
-Yes. Mother? What... what's wrong? Leave it, are you crying? -Did someone hurt you again?
-It's nothing, Mother. I know, I know who could have done it. My child, Sister and Nosheen have
nothing else to do than to hurt you. The don't have a beautiful heart like your. What else can they do? The qualities you have got,
 they don't have it. Just don't get hurt, okay. You shouldn't take
 anything they say to your heart, okay? I don't take anything said
by anyone to my heart if it's about me. But I don't know what happens to me, if anybody says anything about you,
I just can't tolerate it, my child. Mother, please don't worry. And look you got me busy in talking to you, Zaid is going to ask after a while,
"Aima have you ironed my shirt yet or not?" -"Aima, is my shirt ready yet?"
-See, did you just see that? Have to do all his work, as if
I am his slave. Getting it! Hello. Yes, Azmat Hussain here. Yes, Mr. Khalid, I have recognized you.
Greetings, how are you doing? Yes, I had asked you
 to look for a proposal. Whenever it's easy for you. Sure, fine, no problem at all. Thank you, thank you,
I will be waiting for you. God bye. What happened? Isn't Zaid back yet? Is he going to have a lunch
and dinner date both? No idea. I just don't get what Zaid saw in Kinza. Was she the only one to fall
 in love with? I detest her. Don't know what he saw in her. Zoya, I can't say
anything about this. What sort of an answer is this? Tell me something, do you find
Kinza and Zaid's couple okay? I seriously have no idea about it, Zoya. Zaid knows better what he is doing. Aima, what sort
 of weird answers are you giving? -You should be more concerned about Zaid.
-What do you mean? Aima, we both are his best friends, if we are not worried about
him who else would be? Now, look, how worried I am about him. Aren't you? And just imagine, if she is that
typical kind of a girl, okay, and she has issues with our friendship, and she asks him to leave us,
aren't you worried about that? Yes, that's true. If Kinza or any other girl
tries to spoil our friendship, then we... we will going
to end their relationship. Aima, Aima, what's wrong? -Nothing.
-Why are you crying then? Tell me. Just some domestic issues. Mother isn't well. Auntie and Nosheen's behaviour. I just feel like crying at times. I feel like... things are getting out of control. Oh, God, for once I thought you
were crying for Zaid. Aima, everything will be fine, okay? Do you want me to talk to them? I just don't understand why
she behaves with you like this. And Nosheen is really rude. No, don't get involved
 in this matter at all. I'll handle it myself. Okay, as you wish. Okay listen, since you aren't
able to attend the lectures,  I am going to record
the lectures for you, okay? -Thank you.
-But you idiot, you scared me. Whatever it is, you can share it with me. Check it, may be it's Zaid's. -Who is it?
-I don't know Zoya. I got a message earlier
from this number as well, saying hello. I didn't respond to it then. And now there are so many messages,
coming from this number. He knows my name too. Give this number to me, I'll call him. And if its is some cheapster,
I am going to hit him. I think just forget it.
We shouldn't pay heed to such people. They become a nuisance. What if it is someone I know.
 I'll take care of it myself. Yes you  are right, Okay, listen, I'll get going now. Don't know when Zaid is going
to be back, so see you. -Bye.
-Bye. -Zaid, Zaid...
-Yes, mother? What is this? I'm sure
Aima must have given it to you. No, what are you doing? Give it back.
There is a thing called privacy. Oh, you kids.
Who is Kinza? A friend or... Yes, she is a friend. What is it? Well, it's your dad's order that you stay
home as we are expecting some guests. Guests? Yes, some people are coming
for Nosheen's proposal. What do mean for her proposal?
 It isn't the right age for her to get married, she hasn't even completed
her university yet. Your dad thinks that Nosheen
is getting out of hands. Don't know what dad keeps thinking,
didn't you try to stop him? How could I stop him?
Does he ever listen to me? And he never asks for my opinion either. Honestly, I have no idea
what is going on in this house. Why were you talking to aunt so rudely? No, it's nothing, just like that. Oh, really? So are you going
 to hide things from me now too? Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that After Hammad has left, you are
the elder one in this house, -so take a little interest now.
-Yeah right, who listens to me here? For that you will have
to get a little serious. If you behave like an elder
then people will consider you as an elder. And if you feel that dad is doing something
wrong, then you should tell him. Advise him. And this way his dictation
in this house would reduce a bit. -Okay.
-This is a house not his factory that he just gives an order
and everybody gets on fulfilling it. Okay, fine , Mother. I am going
to talk to dad about it. Talk to him when the people
who are bringing Nosheen's proposal leave. All right. -By the way how does this Kinza look like?
-Please, Mother, stop irritating me, please. What is it? I am seeing you reading
a news paper for the first time. couldn't you find anything else to read? What else should I do then? Should I
become a news anchor on some news channel? I am bored of staying at home.
 No college, no phone? It would be better if I commit suicide. Stop this nonsense,
I have to talk to you about something. What is it? Has your husband
put any more sanctions on me? Oh, stop being so dramatic. -Some people are coming.
-What people. To meet you. Mother, if you guys want me
to create mischief let me know. -What are you going to do?
-I don't know. But whatever I am going to do
 it might make your life hell. Oh, God! Mother I have already told you clearly
my point of view on this issue. Nosheen, look,
they are just coming to meet you. That doesn't meet that you
are going to get married there. So just to satisfy your dad,
 sit with them for a while. And during that we
 are going to find some solution. I don't believe you, Mother. Don't you trust your mother? Obviously, you are playing
a double game with me. What do you mean? You are allowing the proposals
coming through dad too and you have asked auntie
for my proposals as well. What does that mean? That you want me to
get out of this house as soon as possible. Oh, you silly girl. I had no other solution
to give to your dad. And as far as your marriage is concerned,
I won't let it happen without your consent. Hmm? Okay, listen, I have asked Zaid
to be after your dad as well. He is also going to talk to him
on this topic and try to stop it. Oh, stop it, Mother, my brother
is least bothered about me. Just Aima is dear to him. You both are going to die fighting one day. He isn't that negative
 about you as much as you are. -Really?
-I'm telling you the truth. He was taking your side
in front if your dad as well, he said he is going to talk to him. So, please don't be so negative, Nosheen. Okay, sorry. Your son is great and I am not going
to talk against him ever. Okay, good. Now you will try to be
friends with your brother, So that the people in between
 don't get a chance to gather sympathy. And you know what people
in between am I talking about? Yes, I have that much sense. Okay now carry on reading
 your newspaper, all right? Come on, sister, I am not a matchmaker. that you ask me to find a proposal
and I'll send you several options. Okay, I'll talk to you later. Right now I was discussing
something important with Zoya. Yes. -What's up, Mother?
-Nothing. Why were you talking to Aunt
 so rudely then? No, it's nothing, just like that. Really, so now you are going
to hide things from me, too. What would I hide,
there is nothing as such. You aren't telling either. Nosheen, was really rude
to me the other day. Actually, sister was asking me
to look for a proposal for her. She is very rude. I am not going to
tolerate her misbehavior. And sister must have an idea
about it after talking to me right now. She was asking me, " What did you do,
did you find any proposal for her?" So, are you going to find a proposal
 for her even after her behaviour? No, not at all. I don't want to get involved
 in any matter of such a rude girl. Why don't you tell aunt that? She must also know
how ruder her daughter is. And that's the reason,
you are not looking for a proposal for her. She knows it very well,
she is aware of everything. I just don't say it myself
because I'm afraid she would mind. After all, she is my only sister. Anyway, forget it. ell me, what were we talking about? We were talking
about Nosheen's misbehavior. We were talking about your proposals. Oh, yes. I have rejected two of them, and the one left, I would like to meet him. You are so selective in your choices. But at times, I feel you are too confident. Or, maybe over confident. Mom, I'm smart. Okay, tell me who is he? Faizan. Well, he is a catch,
his father is a colonel, mother is a designer,
and he himself is foreign qualified.  Mom, would you please stop promoting him? Okay, then, should I invite his family? Mom, these aren't the 80s, that his family will come, we all will have
tea together, everyone will meet each other, I want to meet him alone. You can meet him
when he comes with his family. Mom, I want to meet him alone,
 look at him, understand him. And if things work out then okay, and if I don't like him then it ends there. Just ask him to meet me. Hey, you know I have been looking for
you all over, and you are sitting here. And why don't you have your phone with you? By the way, what are you
 doing here at this hour? Why? Can't I sit here? I just felt like being alone,
that's why came here. Are we fighting again?
Is everything all right? No, we are not fighting at all. Anyway, tell me what you wanted to say? Not to say, I came to ask. -What?
-That are you worried about me or not? Worried for what? I mean, I went on a dater today.
What happened? How did it go? You know that I am not at peace
 until I tell you each and every detail. But no, you are least interested. It was such a special day for me. Sorry, Zaid, it's just that I am a little
disturbed these days. -What happened? Because of Auntie's health?
-Obviously. Aima, I have told you just don't worry,
we all are here to take care of auntie, to spend time with her. And if she wants
we can also take her to the hospital. And I had talked to her, she said
she is feeling well, so just chill. Okay, now listen to all the details,
or else my stomach ache won't end. Okay, then tell me how did it go? What should I tell? -You know, I broke one of my rules today.
-What rule? Kinza is such a lively person, that
when she felt thirsty, she told me to stop the car and have
sugar cane juice from a street vendor, and made me drink it as well. And you know I don't drink
anything from these random places, but couldn't say no to her. Zaid, shall I ask you something? Is she as serious about you as you are? Brother, since the say dad has
stopped me from going to college, all my routine is disturbed. Hmm. Brother, please talk to dad to get
me re-admitted to the college. Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that Oh yes, we both feel the same way. You know, you know she told me that she is unable to sleep without me, then I
also said that I am restless without you. Hours turn into minutes with her.
I lose track of time. I feel... I feel that I am falling in love with her. I am telling you such romantic things,
at least give me some response. No, I... I'm listening. Just listening is not enough,
show some expressions as well. You know, Zoya is meeting
a guy too, tomorrow. Really? Why? -Why does one meet a guy?
-Really? She didn't even tell me. She called me just a while ago. And it's not a date,
you can say it's an arranged date. That guy had sent a proposal for Zoya. That's amazing. This mean all three
of our fates are moving parallel. We three were single few days a ago,
and see now... Why don't you look for a guy, too. We will
get married together on the same venue. End of story. Aima, what is it? Aima, look here towards me. Aima. What is it? Tell me. I told you that I am worried about mother. Don't lie to me.
I know it's not about aunt, tell me. Why would I lie to you? No you aren't telling the truth,
I want to know it. Tell me right now. Why are you crying? Zaid... I like you. I really like you a lot. And not since now, since long ago. I love you so much. Aima... -What?
-What happened, you didn't answer my question. I am worried because
of the environment of the house. What happened at home, Aima? Zaid, these days , auntie
 and Nosheen are behaving very rudely. -With you?
-With mother too. I just worry that, what if they say
something that mother takes to her heart. That's why I'm really disturbed.
I just don't know how to handle all this. Aima, how would I know
all this if you don't tell me. It just didn't feel right
 to tell you all this. What is right or wrong about it? Because they are your mother and sister. So what? I am going to talk to mother. No, Zaid. Please don't even think about it. That's the reason I didn't tell you. But why, Aima?
 I can't let anyone hurt you in any way. Zaid, you are not going to talk
 to anybody, understood? -Reason?
-Because this isn't right. Aunt and Nosheen would feel
that I have complained about them to you. Aima, Aima, please stop being so childish. I am talking sensibly, Zaid,
you are getting emotional. Seriously, please. -That's why I am saying, try to understand.
-What should I understand, Aima? That with your interference
the issue can aggravate. Means, Nosheen and mother can do whatever
they want and we should just stay quiet? Because it would be of no use
even if you talk to them. Look if she had any fear, she would have
been afraid of dad that we won't tell him. But it isn't like that. Anyways, cheer up. I'm fine. You, know I'm feeling good now. Why is that? May be because I shared my problem
with you. I am relaxed now. At least smile now. By the way, I have another
way to reduce stress. Really? And what is that? Slaps. You can slap me a couple of times. -I am going to slap real hard.
-Yeah, sure, go on. During your phone call I
realized that you are angry with me, so, I have come to appease you. To tell you the truth, I really didn't like
the way Nosheen talked to me. I know, she is and idiot. And she has been really
rebellious these days. I apologize on her behalf. Oh, come on. What are you doing? I have no complains with you. Thank God, or else I was worried that if my only sister gets angry with
me who am I going to bewail my troubles to. Just don't mind what Nosheen says.
 Kids these days are just like that. No, sister, that's no excuse.
Nosheen is not a kid. And being young isn't related
to rudeness or politeness. My daughter is young too. But Zoya knows it very well
how to respect elders. Has she ever misbehaved with your? No she hasn't. Sister, let me give you an
advice, please don't mind, Nosheen really needs your attention. You want her to get married
as soon as possible, so, you know it very well how important
it is to have patience in it. Or else a marriage can't sustain. -Am I wrong?
-No, you are right. Actually, she has taken after her paternal
aunt, that's why she is like that. No, sister, I disagree
with you here as well. Shabana is a very soft- natured lady. And Aima isn't rude like Nosheen at all. In fact she has a very soft nature as well. She isn't rude at least. Now you are degrading Nosheen. I know, sister that you
don't like that girl at all. But whatever I am saying is the truth. I admit that Nosheen did wrong. She was really irritated
and agitated that day. Anyway, I was telling all this
to you for your own benefit. In fact Nosheen has to go to
another house after marriage, if her temperament and behaviour remains
the same, who is going to tolerate it? Anyway, forget it. Tell me what would
you like to have, tea, coffee? In fact, it's dinner time. Dinner will be
served in a while, we'll have it together. Who are you and what do you want? I'll get the movie tickets,
we can watch the night show. Okay, listen, give me two minutes,
I'll call you back. You, at this hour? Yes, I was hungry, so I thought
 to give you some snacks too. Don't worry brother, I haven't
listened to anything you said. -Remain in your limits.
-I was just kidding. Why are you still up? Brother, since the day dad has
stopped me from going to college, all my routine is disturbed. Please talk to dad to get me
re-admitted to the college. Firstly, dad doesn't listen to me. And secondly? And secondly, do you have
any idea what you have done? -What have I done?
-What do you mean what have you done? Staying away from home till midnight,
being friends with all sorts of people, Really? You are talking as if
you are a saint yourself. I am well aware, you have done
all this more than I have. Behave yourself. You are forgetting,
 I am still your elder brother. Okay, okay, sorry.
I am just saying that everyone does it. -Listen, it's it's different, okay?
-Really? Is it different? What sort of a reason is this? Boys can do whatever they want, and girls
should stay confined in the house? Don't you start this
useless argument with me. No, not so easily, brother.
Tell me, why are men so dual-faced? Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that It's the same guy who
messaged me the other day. He has been sending me messages since
last night, I have just had it with him. -Who is it?
-I don't know. So, what is he saying? I had some complains from you. You know that I don't keep
anything to my heart. Is everything all right , dear? A family came to meet me,
 you must know about it.
