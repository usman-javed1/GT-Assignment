[0.00] From flowers and from buds
[4.57] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.16] When I saw you
[14.30] I learned to chirp from you
[18.98] From now on, you won't go
anywhere without asking me.
[22.66] You will go only if you have my
or mom's permission otherwise not.
[26.74] I went to my Mama's
not to meet any boyfriend.
[30.80] -Aima is joining office from tomorrow.
-Okay.
[35.15] She is starting work, this means
that everything is normal at home.
[39.69] I think you shouldn't delay
joining office anymore.
[43.25] -You tell me how can I keep everyone happy?
-Zaid, you don't need to keep everyone happy.
[50.02] Just keep Zoya happy.
[53.68] Even I wanted that.
[56.01] But it isn't possible in this situation.
[74.75] -Greetings.
-How was your day today?
[79.72] It was fine.
[81.59] There you go, your mother
has already poisoned you.
[85.35] What nonsense, Nosheen.
[87.05] I am right, tell me didn't she
complain about me to you?
[92.46] You are at fault yourself and
then you are arguing with me?
[97.48] I don't want to argue either, Faiq.
[101.16] Oh, really? Then what is it
that you are doing now?
[105.49] Do you know mom had to clean the
whole kitchen herself because of you.
[108.71] You had made such a mess.
[112.25] For God's sake, Faiq, when one works in
the kitchen then it's supposed to be messy.
[117.08] If you don't believe me
you can ask anybody.
[122.30] Your mother has a problem with me.
[126.67] No matter what I do for her,
she will never be happy.
[130.05] She just can't bear looking at
me in place of her favorite one.
[138.00] What happened? Why
are you quiet? Answer me.
[142.99] I don't want to give any answers.
[146.57] Just keep one thing in mind,
[149.19] if you want to see me happy you
will have to keep mom happy too.
[152.94] And if someone doesn't want to be
happy then what can I do about it?
[158.41] Look, Nosheen, nothing
is impossible in this world.
[162.06] Maybe you aren't trying sincerely.
[165.88] Sincerely? You are blindfolded
my your mother's love.
[172.40] And you are unable to see anything.
[179.04] But it's okay.
[180.82] Whatever I do for you both,
I can never be good enough.
[187.01] Look, Nosheen, I know,
mom is being tough on you.
[192.44] But that's not the solution to our problem.
[194.55] You will have to win mom's
heart. You will have to try your best.
[198.65] Faiq, please believe me
auntie treats me very badly.
[204.89] Okay, do one thing,
[209.32] whenever you go to the
kitchen take her with you.
[213.94] This way she won't have
any complains with you.
[217.45] No, Faiq, I won't go to your
mom's kitchen from now on.
[223.99] She has insulted me so much today.
[228.41] No, Nosheen, not so easily.
[231.66] Or else she would think that you
were just waiting for it to happen.
[236.47] Nosheen, say sorry to mom
[240.27] and next time take her with you so
that you work under her supervision.
[245.33] And please get my clothes ready,
I have to go out on a dinner, I'll change.
[249.93] Till then I'll freshen up.
[257.28] Such a tough bone he is,
all the drama for nothing.
[274.25] Oh my God, Zaid, it's a 28-day
trip, it's going to be so much fun.
[280.20] Aren't you excited?
[283.13] No, no, I am excited.
[286.16] -Are you sure?
-Yes, of course.
[291.81] What?
[294.59] Nothing, it's just that your expressions
and words aren't syncing with each other.
[300.93] It's not like that, Zoya.
It's just that it's a 28-day trip.
[306.10] We have so less time.
[308.06] One has to manage so many things.
[311.42] Leaving the house for a month,
it's not easy.
[314.95] Yeah, I get you.
[317.56] What things and what people
you are talking about.
[320.86] It's not that, Zoya, try to understand.
[325.94] Why should I have to
understand every time?
[327.65] Why can't others understand
that we both have a life too.
[331.41] We both deserve some privacy too, Zaid.
[333.78] Yeah, you are right,
I'm handling the situation.
[338.45] Tell me honestly, Zaid. If you can't
manage then I am going to say no to mom.
[343.88] For God's sake Zoya, what are you saying?
[348.43] Of course I want to go on
this trip, I want to go with you.
[351.40] And why do you get
aggressive on everything?
[357.08] I'm sorry.
[365.38] Zaid, I hope nobody is going to
have any issues with us leaving.
[371.91] Why would anyone have any problem?
[373.66] We'll go, we'll definitely go.
[375.69] Okay then, I am going to look at all
the locations where we have to travel.
[381.38] Look, Zaid, look at this,
[385.62] such a beautiful location.
[388.10] We are going to get
a picture here for sure.
[390.35] Done.
[391.14] Wait a second, Zaid, scuba diving.
[395.68] You'll come with me for that, won't you?
[397.61] Zaid, promise me that
you will come with me.
[400.41] No promise me right now.
[402.32] I promise, we'll do it.
[406.21] Zaid, look, I really need this trip.
[410.41] I am too tired.
[413.88] You know what? I get it. Honestly
I am too stressed myself these days and
[419.76] you know what, let's go have some fun.
[421.87] Done! We are going to
go and forget everything.
[426.04] Yeah, yeah sure. You know what,
let me get some hotel bookings done.
[463.34] Why are you looking at her? Talk to me.
[466.76] Actually, Dad, what happened was...
[471.13] You don't need to worry.
[473.88] In fact you should be happy.
[478.05] I have no objection on
your choice. I'm really happy.
[482.73] Dad, seriously?
[484.96] What's wrong with that?
The girl is well known to us.
[489.60] Come, come. I was pulling your son's leg.
[495.01] You ought to do that in such matters.
[499.69] We thought of him as a kid, but he
has proven to be a hidden warrior.
[504.48] Before I started looking for girls for him,
he has made things easy for us himself.
[509.98] Yes, you should be happy.
He has solved your problem.
[515.71] Yes, I'm really happy. After all he
has chosen the girl of my choice.
[533.79] I was just checking your fever, so...
[538.59] I have told you so many
times to stay away from me.
[542.76] How can I leave you in this condition?
[545.71] Dad has given me the
responsibility to take care of you.
[549.45] I don't need anyone.
[551.55] Whatever happened, what's going to happen
in future, I'm responsible for that myself.
[554.52] Stop being so stubborn.
Till when is this going to go on?
[560.98] You have been like this since a week.
[565.43] You should keep in mind that you aren't
just hurting yourself but all of us as well.
[568.91] I haven't hurt anyone, Aima, nor
anybody needs to worry about me.
[573.89] How can we not worry about you?
[576.71] You are very important for us.
[580.62] Do you have any idea in what
condition dad brought you home?
[587.12] We all got so worried after
knowing about your accident.
[591.78] What if anything happened to you, Zaid?
[594.57] It would have been better,
your lives would have been easier.
[606.48] I have told you already that they
were satisfied till our last project.
[610.38] Something has gone wrong.
[612.44] Otherwise it is out of
question that Imran industries
[615.36] gives such a major
project to someone else.
[618.20] Did you mail them?
[620.94] Really? So when have they set the meeting?
[625.15] Yeah okay, I hope there isn't any issue.
[629.97] I want that client at any cost,
okay, you can't let them go.
[633.49] They are our biggest and oldest client.
[636.16] Understand?
[638.08] Okay, bye.
[650.49] Oh, Zain, come, I was about to call you.
[653.88] Come sit.
[658.01] Everything okay, Dad?
[659.30] Yeah, I have set your
meeting with Imran Industries.
[664.49] But their office has shifted to Islamabad.
[667.33] Don't worry about that,
your ticket will be booked.
[673.61] In fact, take Aima with you too.
[679.20] Because she was on their last project
and they were very satisfied with her.
[687.08] But Zaid, you have to
convince this client at any cost.
[690.12] We can't lose them.
[694.14] Because if they leave our company's
reputation will suffer great loss
[697.99] that we can't afford right now.
[704.23] They are the biggest client in the market,
who make their payments timely as well.
[709.12] You get my point?
[711.22] Yes, Dad.
[712.23] I have confidence in you both that you
are going to get this client back to us.
[720.37] What's wrong, Zaid? Is there
something you are worried about?
[723.45] Dad, actually I cam to
talk to you about something.
[728.41] Go ahead.
[730.25] Actually, Dad, I'm a little confused. I
think I won't be able to go to Islamabad.
[735.79] Actually, auntie has booked
mine and Zoya's tickets for Europe.
[744.48] I was just a bit confused.
[748.79] Our flight is in two days.
[755.91] Fine.
[758.44] See for yourself. Whatever you think
is more important, you shall go there.
[763.27] I leave that decision to you, you decide.
[799.61] Mother thinks
[802.47] that after Zaid came to my room,
everything has got normal.
[807.89] But she doesn't know that some
decisions are never reversed.
[822.72] Did you talk to Zaid?
[825.84] Did he say anything?
[828.71] No.
[829.55] -Did he?
-He didn't come to my room.
[836.72] And even if he did, what
would have he said to me?
[840.65] That he is indebted
[843.99] that I have destroyed
his happily married life?
[848.80] Why are you thinking like that?
[850.92] What should I think then?
Haven't I committed a sin?
[855.90] It would be better if
we don't talk right now.
[859.20] I am in such a situation
right now
[861.78] that I'm hearing something else
and understanding something else.
[865.08] Try to understand.
[868.31] Are you feeling all right?
I'm worried about you.
[873.12] Yes, I am fine. Don't worry about me.
[878.73] Where are you going in such condition.
[881.95] Aima, please, I have
told you to leave me alone.
[894.47] My relationship with
Zaid is just like that too.
[901.89] That the decisions between it
are going to remain the same.
[909.49] But I can't tell that to mother.
[918.90] I will have to stay happy in
front of her for her own happiness.
[945.91] You won't believe, Mom,
I have already made plans.
[949.03] Scuba diving, sky diving,
late night beach walk.
[952.32] Thank you so much.
[955.19] Okay, listen, Waheed told me
that he has arranged for cabs online,
[959.99] so that you both don't have any issue.
[962.10] And if you get any other bookings
too then you may call Waheed.
[966.76] You're the best mom ever.
[969.73] I just want that my
daughter always stays happy.
[974.44] Listen, where is Zaid? Is he happy?
[979.71] Of course, Mom, why wouldn't he be happy?
[983.97] Okay, now be careful,
someone may create some drama.
[989.15] Who are you talking about?
[990.97] There are so many people in your house who
must not be liking that you both are going.
[994.77] Yeah, that's true.
[996.67] Okay, listen, no matter what
anyone says, just ignore them.
[1004.27] And prepare Zaid for it too.
[1006.30] I don't want your plan to get
rescheduled because of anybody.
[1010.93] You get my point?
[1013.24] Yeah, Mom, don't worry, nothing
as such is going to happen.
[1016.65] Zaid has promised me.
[1018.99] With due apologies, please don't mind,
[1021.77] but your Zaid is an arrant fool.
[1026.35] He has no opinion of his own, and in front
of his dad he just can't say anything.
[1032.66] Mom, don't worry, we will go.
[1035.55] Okay, if you are that sure
then I won't say anything more.
[1039.59] Yes, Mom, I will handle
everything, don't worry, okay?
[1042.71] And listen, do keep warm
clothes like over coat etc.
[1048.80] Yeah, Mom, in fact I have got
two leather jackets for myself.
[1051.83] I'll just send you their picture, okay?
[1055.28] Bye.
[1056.56] Okay, take care of yourself. Bless you.
[1073.23] What do you mean he can't come.
[1075.19] I don't care if it is his family
commitment or any other thing.
[1078.55] Tell him that he has to attend
tomorrow's meeting, okay?
[1082.59] What?
[1084.34] Which hospital?
[1087.64] Oh!
[1089.70] You should have told me that before.
[1091.79] Yeah, okay, tell him to take care of
his mother, I'll so something.
[1094.49] Yeah, okay, I'll manage.
[1100.39] Brother, everything all right?
You seem a little worried.
[1103.28] Yeah, there is an issue at work,
I'm just worried about that.
[1108.72] Anything serious?
[1111.21] Yeah kind of, but I'm trying, it
will resolve soon if God wills.
[1116.28] If God wills.
[1117.58] You tell me, everything all right?
[1119.92] Yeah, actually when sister Farhana heard
about Zaid and Aima's marriage then...
[1127.82] She wants to invite us for dinner.
[1129.98] That's really nice, when do we
have to go? We'll definitely go there.
[1134.80] But this issue going on at your office...
[1137.66] What does the official
issue has to do with it?
[1139.68] I keep my personal and
professional life separate.
[1143.49] -It's okay then.
-So, when do we have to go?
[1146.87] -She said if we could come tomorrow.
-Tomorrow, okay we all will go then.
[1151.94] -Let's go, make me a cup of tea.
-Sure.
[1161.31] Where's Zaid, Aima?
[1163.63] I have no idea.
[1165.89] Why, what happened? Everything all right?
[1169.66] I thought everything was fine,
[1172.45] but it's been 4 hours now and Zaid
hasn't replied any of my calls or messages.
[1176.28] He might be busy.
[1179.76] That's why he couldn't
reply to your messages.
[1183.20] How can he be that busy that
he isn't even able to reply me?
[1187.65] I don't have any idea about that.
[1193.77] Where did you see him last?
[1196.07] I saw him in the lawn.
Yeah, I saw him there.
[1203.20] Did he say anything?
[1206.31] No, nothing, in fact I went to talk to him.
[1209.75] So he seemed a little disturbed.
[1213.99] What do you mean? You went to meet him?
[1220.35] Anyway, forget it, did he tell
you why he was disturbed?
[1225.39] No, I don't have any idea about that.
[1227.61] -How can this be, Aima?
-What do you mean?
[1231.98] I mean,
[1233.93] he shares every problem with
you, he must have said something.
[1239.32] He used to.
[1242.22] Not anymore.
[1266.47] Isn't there any alternate?
[1269.00] No, sir, right now we don't have
anybody to work on this project.
[1273.50] Where is the rest of the team
which was dealing with this project?
[1277.11] Sir Hassan was on it, his
mother is in the hospital
[1279.68] and in a very serious
condition so he has taken off.
[1282.45] And Farooq?
[1284.86] Sir Farooq has the same issue,
[1286.79] his wife has some medical issue so
he had applied for leave long before.
[1294.96] Sir, Mr. Azmat called, he said that he
is going to go for this meeting himself.
[1300.23] Dad's going to go?
[1302.80] He was telling that you are busy, so may be
he is going to go himself, with Madam Aima.
[1310.03] -Are their flights booked yet?
-No, sir.
[1313.73] They said he will confirm me
once it's done.
[1316.43] All right.
[1320.39] Sir, I think, Mr, Azmat isn't
comfortable with going himself.
[1326.27] Because the owners don't
attend such meetings themselves.
[1329.46] They will be having their team too,
[1331.16] and Mr. Sadaqat won't be
present in the meeting too.
[1332.76] Yeah, I know the team
attends such meetings.
[1335.23] Okay, I'll do something about it,
please go and brief the accounts about it.
[1338.85] Okay, sir, thank you.
[1350.89] Zaid I have been noticing that you are
ignoring everything related to that girl.
[1358.06] I have told you this
a lot of times before too.
[1360.99] But I don't see that you are
giving importance to what I say.
[1366.15] Zaid, if you have taken the responsibility
then you will have to fulfill it as well.
[1370.51] It's important, you will be
answerable for that as a husband.
[1375.49] God may let go of his rights
[1377.09] but he will not forgive if one
doesn't give people their due rights.
[1382.38] Aima is your wife give her, her due rights.
[1385.82] You have to give her her rights
either you want to or not.
[1391.61] If Aima stays quiet that doesn't mean
[1393.75] that you treat her as you like and nobody
is going to question you about it too.
[1399.21] I can't see injustice being
done to anyone in my house.
[1404.20] Half of my life is spend
advising my wife and daughter
[1407.23] to be fair to my sister and niece.
[1409.56] And I don't want that rest of my
life is spent in lecturing you about it.
[1425.56] Dad, please don't worry,
[1430.60] I will go for the meeting.
[1433.10] Yeah, but you going alone
isn't appropriate at all.
[1436.63] You must have to take someone along.
[1438.45] They have such a big team how
are you going to handle them alone?
[1442.04] I'm thinking of coming along with you.
[1446.24] So would it be appropriate for you to go?
[1449.80] Well it isn't but I don't
have any other option either.
[1453.00] I'm actually very worried.
[1458.76] Don't worry, there are still
two days left for the meeting.
[1463.09] We will find an option eventually.
[1469.60] Did you
[1472.59] talk to Zaid?
[1475.20] Yeah, I did.
[1479.32] But right now he has more
important things to do than this.
[1483.12] Anyway, we will have to go for the meeting.
[1487.70] If you are ready to come, then
I'll get your and my seats booked.
[1493.13] Okay, fine, Dad.
[1510.05] Hello, yeah, Mr. Danish,
[1512.24] please book two seats for me and Aima to go
for the meeting of Salman group of Industries.
[1518.28] Wait a minute, Dad.
[1520.86] I'll just call you back,
hold it for a minute.
[1523.65] You don't need to go,
I'm ready to go there.
[1550.81] -Mom, sit down, Nosheen will bring it.
-Just have to get the glasses now.
[1580.57] Be a little gentle, Nosheen.
[1584.42] What's wrong?
I have just put the glasses down.
[1586.31] Well you could have kept them gently too.
[1590.31] -Is there a specific way to do that too?
-Yeah there is.
[1594.12] Do I have to learn that as well?
[1596.25] Nosheen, you are supposed
to put glasses on the table in such a way
[1598.79]  that they don't make a sound.
[1600.47] Otherwise either the glass will
break or the table might get a scratch.
[1606.31] And if the glass breaks, 
you might get hurt too.
[1609.56] If I can't do this right even,
why don't you keep a servant then?
[1613.40] You do not hire servants for everything.
[1615.37] The women in the house
should do some tasks too.
[1617.75] And where is it written?
[1621.20] Nosheen, instead of arguing,
why don't have your meal quietly?
[1625.66] Faiq, pass her the kebabs.
[1629.62] I don't want these.
[1633.13] What's wrong with you?
[1634.75] You have been behaving so strangely since 
I have returned home. Are you in your senses?
[1638.44] What do you care? 
All you care about is your mother.
[1642.01] Mind your language, got it?
[1644.33] This is how I talk.
[1646.01] Then do one thing, 
get up from here and get lost.
[1649.41] As if you are so well-mannered. 
Have you ever noticed your tone?
[1652.49] My tone gets bad when
your attitude gets bad.
[1655.75] Faiq, how are you both
talking to each other?
[1658.97] I wish you had taught some
manners to your son as well,
[1661.59] it's very easy to point fingers 
at other people's children.
[1664.52] Will you just shut up?
[1666.66] -What are you going to do? Hit me?
-Yeah, I'll hit you.
[1670.76] If you won't control yourself
then I am going to even hit you.
[1679.19] Mom.
[1695.22] Zaid, do you have any
idea how worried I was?
[1698.90] Okay, I'm sorry, I got stuck somewhere.
[1701.53] You got stuck? You could have at
least replied to my messages or my calls.
[1705.88] What's wrong, told you I'm sorry.
[1708.16] Sorry, once again sorry.
[1710.83] You have no idea how I
felt during these six hours.
[1715.26] You are getting worried for no
reason, where would have I gone?
[1719.68] What kind of weird things are you saying?
[1723.09] What's wrong?
[1729.58] What is it?
[1732.08] What are you thinking?
[1733.62] Nothing.
[1735.96] Anyway, forget it,
[1737.48] Listen, we have to go for
shopping, and please cheer up a bit.
[1742.98] Show me your happy face. Smile.
[1745.64] And we are going to go to nice
places, and I'm really excited, okay.
[1757.33] Where are we going? What happened?
[1759.85] -For shopping.
-Why?
[1763.53] Zaid! I just told you that we
are going for shopping
[1768.04] because I talked to mama and she said
that we should keep warm clothes with us.
[1771.34] I have mine, but I think
you don't have any.
[1773.84] So, let's go for shopping. 
Shall we go right now?
[1779.84] Zaid, is there a problem?
[1785.34] -Hmm.
-Hmm , again?
[1788.83] Tell me, what happened?
[1793.06] Zoya,
[1795.90] we
[1799.77] are not going on the trip.
[1806.98] -Wait, Zoya.
-Leave my hand.
[1810.87] Zoya, just try to understand
me, at least listen to me.
[1814.99] Zaid, I don't want to
listen to anything you say.
[1817.18] Zoya, I swear it's not my fault, 
I compelled to.
[1822.04] You may stay compelled for life.
[1824.62] Zoya, I'm really sorry, please try to understand.
[1828.69] I said leave my hand.
[1832.84] Zoya!
[1838.16] You were right.
[1841.05] I was always wrong.
[1844.16] They are never going to let me be happy.
[1846.26] And Zaid is just like a puppet.
[1847.55] I am not scared of your threats, nor
am I scared of your threats to hit me.
[1853.26] These aren't just threats, Nosheen. The way you are misbehaving,
[1859.80] I'm afraid these threats 
might turn into reality.
[1865.22] Mama, I can't tell you, his mother is
nothing in compared to Faiq's cleverness.
[1867.60] My fate is ruined. 
Oh, God where did I get married.
[1872.27] Listen madam, why are you blaming God now?
[1876.78] His nature tried it's best that
you don't jump into this hell.
[1880.09] But you were your own enemy.
[1882.84] You always thing I am the one who is wrong.
