From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you Okay, if you want should I
tell you about a proposal? Yes, sister, sure. My distant relatives, they are
looking for a girl for their son. They asked about Nosheen but their son is a little old for Nosheen. So I thought I should ask you. After all Aima belongs to our house too. Meet him once. If you like him, then with God's
will your marriage can be fixed. All right? -Mother.
-Yes? Say yes to auntie on my behalf. -Okay, then tell me.
-What? Anything about yourself. What should I tell you about myself? What you know about yourself. What's wrong? -Don't you know anything about yourself?
-It's not like that. I was just thinking what one
should tell on such instances. Okay, let me help you out. Look, first of all you need to relax, okay? It's just a friendly talk.
It's not a formal interview, okay? And look, I'm not telling
you about myself right now because we have limited
time, and my story is very long. So, I'm going to tell that
to you when we have time. Okay, so what do you want to know about me? I just want to know what your
routine is? Who your friends are? Likes, dislikes, just all this. I get up at 5:00 in the morning. I pray. Then I prepare for breakfast with mother
and then have breakfast with everyone. And then I go to office. Oh, wait, wait. Come on. I'm not asking you to provide
me details from morning till night. Okay, tell me about your social circle. I don't have any a social circle as such. Don't tell me, Aima. You know
I've got a long list of friends. And at times I feel like
I breathe just because of them. Really? My friends are just Zaid and Zoya. -Zaid?
-Yeah, my cousin. Oh, that's good. He's a nice chap. And it's nice that your friend is at home.
You don't have to go anywhere to meet him. Yeah, that's true.
We go to meet Zoya at times. Or she visits us at times. And we three are always together in the
university and have a lot of fun together. Good. But now that you are going to get
married, Zaid is going to miss you a lot. No, it won't happen. Why? Doesn't one misses his friends? -When I'll leave then Zoya will come here.
-Meaning? Because they both are getting married. Oh, with each other? -Wow, that's great.
-They're lucky. Okay let's do one thing. Why don't you be
friends with me? You'll be lucky too then. How? Because then you'll get
married to your friend. Yeah, that's a nice idea. Well it's done then, we are
friends from now on, okay? By the way our families
have given us plenty of time. So, I'm thinking to tell you
something about myself too. -Yeah, sure.
-They're calling you inside. -I told you.
-We'll be right there. -Okay, you go, I'll just  make a call and come.
-Yeah, okay. Aima, hasn't Faiq come with you? Auntie he is talking
to someone, brother Fai... Dear, don't do this. Just forget
that you ever used to call him brother. Sorry, auntie, I'm just used to say it. It's all right, you'll get
rid of saying it gradually. Believe me, brother Azmat, since the day I have decided
to find a match for Faiq, this is my first and last proposal
that I have given for Aima. Shabana didn't take me seriously
but I never lost hope. Oh, so she is here finally. Oh, so that's why your dad
was stopping me to go for shopping. Actually, Shabana was interested
but I asked her to wait for a while. -Really?
-Actually we never wanted to send Aima so far away. And now it's a miracle of nature
that you have come near us yourself. Brother Azmat, you don't need to
worry about where we live. Near or far. You just need to know that
we will never fail in taking care of Aima. -Let's go.
-You go ahead, I'll be right there. -I believe in you.
-I don't know where this boy is? We're getting late,
we have to get back home. No, how can you leave like that?
Shabana has made so many arrangements. She has made lunch especially for you. She has been busy since morning.
Please you must eat with us. Brother, there was no
need of this formality. I just told her that we'll
leave after meeting. But now that Shabana has
made so much arrangements, it doesn't seem appropriate to say no. -Oh, shi**
-Excuse me. Sorry, sorry, I'm really sorry. Let me just clean it up. I hope I didn't burn your hand. -Excuse me?
-Yes? -I asked you something.
-What? Does it burn on your hand? It is, a little. I hope it doesn't leave a scar. We'll get to know later
how deep the scar is. By the way, I came to ask who you
are and what are you doing in my home? I'm really sorry. I came here
considering it Aima's house. I didn't know that you
live here as well. Or else I would have taken
permission from you. No, it's okay. By the way, I'm Faiq. I'm a guest here. I'm Nosheen, and this is my house. I'm really sorry, I thought
my auntie lives here. She lives with us. Okay, good. By the way are you just here to meet your
auntie or is there any other reason too? You're very smart. Actually I've come here to meet Aima. But you have met me too. Yeah, that's true, but I've come
to meet Aima for a specific reason. -I think you must have gotten me.
-Yeah, of course. What's wrong? Nothing, it's just that
I'm a little surprised. Surprised? What for? You seem quite decent apparently. Anyways are you going to keep
talking to me or will you come inside too? It's your house, we're
here in your house. How can we enter it
without your permission? -May I?
-Yeah, sure. Shabana should have come sit with us now. She went to make tea right after lunch. Shabana is like that since
the beginning. So hospitable. She never sits down with
anyone for a minute even. Yes, true. Anyways, how long has
it been since you're back? It's been few days since Faiq got back, I went to Canada to Asim.
I just got back from there. All right. Believe me, this is the
first house that I'm visiting. You could have come
later after relaxing a bit. I am relaxed by seeing Aima. To tell you the truth, brother Azmat, this was my long held desire that
Aima becomes my daughter in law. God didn't give a long life to my brother. But Shabana has raised Aima so well
that my brother would be at peace up there. That's true, Shabana has raised Aima
as well as she could. With God's grace, brother Azmat, her personality is like
this since the beginning. She has been so considerate,
wise and humble since childhood. She is like a diamond. Whichever
house she goes, she'll turn it to heaven. It's just that God has given you the vision
which can recognize a diamond like Aima. Otherwise not everyone has this
kind of a vision to recognize gems. Brother, Azmat, I'm asking Aima's hand
in marriage for my son Faiq from you. And I'm completely sure that you
are going to fulfill my long held desire. But before that,
I want to have Aima's consent. Don't worry, sister. If everything works
out God is going to make everything better. With God's will. And, brother Azmat if you want to make
any inquiries about Faiq please go ahead,  it's your right. Faiq has grown up in front of us. That's true, brother Azmat but still
you can satisfy yourself completely. Until now we are pretty satisfied, and with
God's will it is going to remain that way. With God's will. So, what's up? Nothing much. No, no. Something is going on,
I saw you how you were smiling. When was I smiling? I'm not talking about right now. I'm talking about the time you
were with your special someone. I was observing you
what a broad smile you had then. It's amazing that you met him
for the first time and so much understanding. So what? He is nice. Okay, okay, fine.
Means are you going to do that now? Okay, listen, how did you like him? If you like him then it's fine. No, Zaid, I'm asking about your opinion. -Actually, Aima.
-Tell me what it is? I hope you won't mind. Just forget it. Besides,
my opinion doesn't matter that much  that it could change anything. Zaid you know how much
your opinion matters to me. I might change my decision
because of your opinion. Okay then if I say
that I didn't like him at all  and I don't think he is right for you So are you going to say no to this proposal? Listen Aima, I'm sorry. I just didn't know how to tell you that.
You were so happy with him. So didn't you like Faiq? Should I say no
to mother for this proposal? Okay, I'll say no to mother. Oh you crazy girl, I was just joking. How can you reject someone
on the basis that I don't like him. I mean, come on, it's supposed
to be your choice, be confident. Look, Aima, this decision is supposed to
be yours only nobody else's, not even mine. Because ultimately you have
to spend your life with him. In fact if you like a guy
and the whole world is against him I'm going to fight the whole world
but get you married to that guy. Why? Why would you have done so much for me? What do you mean why? Because I love you. You're my best friend. So, how do you like Faiq? He is nice, a very nice guy. I mean, well settled, well educated. Small family, great personality what else
do you want. You have directly hit a six-er. Excuse me, he is my cousin. There you go, another plus point.
You have got a ready made package. Trust me, Aima,
you are going to be very happy. Even more happy than me and Zoya. Just pray for me. So what have you decided? The family is really good. If Aima
finalizes I would fix the marriage soon. Fine. She wasn't getting any proposals from
outsiders, so within family is better. What do you mean? I mean didn't you see how
that lady was praising her niece? I mean, okay everybody has some qualities. But why did she need to praise her so much? Nimra wasn't praising
her to please someone, in fact she was telling her
what she thought of her. One gets to know after
marriage about the reality. She knows her since childhood. And she is well aware
of Shabana's nature too. She is not stupid that she
will wait for Shabana's response. She knows her, that's why she said that. That's why I'm saying,
what did she see in Aima. She is just an ordinary kind of a girl.
Did you see their boy, how handsome he is? He is rich too. Was she the only girl they could find. If you want to pick out faults
in everything then go ahead. But I only wanted yours
and your sister's benefit. Look, when a proposal comes,
a lot of things seem nice and a lot of them are shown as nice. But in reality it isn't like that. Just keep your eyes open before saying yes. My eyes are open. I know the world much more than you do. I know how to deal with the world, so
please keep your suggestions to yourself. Whenever I say something
I become the bad person. I wish you would have
realized Aima's value. That's enough, Mr. Azmat.
Don't say anything more. Now I know why you are in such
a bad mood for so many days. Because Zaid preferred
my niece over your niece. Listen to me carefully. Even if Zaid had chosen Aima then I
wouldn't have let this marriage happen. I wouldn't have let my son's fate ruin. I don't know, I think she
can't chew her food properly that's why she chews
her words so much. Time will tell whose fate is going to
shine and whose if going to get ruined. Sorry, I'm really sorry.
Let me just wipe it. I hope I didn't burn your hand. -Excuse me?
-Yes? I asked you something. By the way, I came to ask who you
are and what are you doing in my home? I'm really sorry. I came here
considering it Aima's house. I didn't know that you
live here as well. This Aima has such good
fate, she has won a lottery. Aima, what are you doing? I was waiting for you. Are you satisfied? Yeah. I can see it on your face. Look, dear, I want you to forget old things. Just forget that you 
had any feelings for Zaid. Mother, I've already moved on. Didn't I tell you that whatever
God does, it's better for us. We often lose hope even after knowing that. I have never lost hope with God. Even I didn't lose hope. But there was a sorrow 
which was eating me from inside. That my daughter couldn't get 
what she wanted. But, dear, today I understood that God's will and wisdom can never be understood by us 
with our insignificant minds. And I have also understood that if you and Zaid had gotten together then sister would have always been 
an obstruction between you two. She would have never 
let you both stay happy. You're right, I had an idea about that. No you see, Aima, 
God has been so merciful to us. I was so happy to see that sister Nimra
was showing so much love towards you. I can't tell you. And I was also happy to know that there is someone who loves
you as much as me and brother do. He is such a wise boy. Mother, are you sure that I
am going to be happy there? Dear, why not? If they are taking you 
so willingly with so much honor, then they are going to keep
you very happy too, with God's will And I am the happiest about the fact that
brother is satisfied with this proposal. Aima, now just your approval is required. Mother, I had already said yes to you. No dear that wasn't your approval. that wasn't your agreement. That was your anger 
with your situation and your fate. You just said yes to 
be saved from your sorrows. To escape from you situation. That's why I didn't consider
that approval of yours as a yes. -Mother, I...
-Dear, the decisions one takes emotionally are usually regretted by him later on. Always remember, whenever
you are grieved just be patient. Don't take any decisions emotionally. Either they are emotions 
of happiness or sorrow. Yes, Mother, you are right. So I want to ask you once again that do you accept this proposal? Yes I accept. Now I can actually see
your acceptance in your yes. Now just let me discuss
something with brother, then I'll say yes to sister Nimra. Are you happy? Aima, I'm really happy. So happy that you have 
no idea about my happiness. -Hello.
-Hi, how are you? I'm good. You tell me, how is auntie doing? She is absolutely fine. Okay, listen what are you doing right now? Me? Nothing special, just little chores. Oh, this means I was just hoping
in vain that you must be missing me. I was thinking that we should
have dinner together tonight. What is it? Say something. No don't say that, what should I say. Seriously I was about to say that. I knew it. Okay, tell me what's your plan? -Okay, I have dinner.
-That's amazing. Then let's have dinner together. that would be really great, 
I'll make something nice for you. No, not at all. It will be a romantic dinner. 
No family member. Only you and me. Oh, that. Let's me ask mother then. I knew you'd say that. That's why 
I have already asked auntie. And she has no objection 
on us going together. -Okay, but...
-No ifs and buts. Just get ready, I'm coming at eight. Faiq, there is so less time till eight. Actually I wanted to see how
much time you take to get ready. I'm doing post marriage preparations. And be ready till eight, okay? And what if I take longer than eight? Then I'll wait a little longer for you. Okay, I'll get ready quickly. Bye. What's up, Nosheen? Everything all right? Oh, no. Life has become so difficult. Just stay confined in this house. Neither anyone talks to me, 
nor involves me in anything. They have removed me from everything. Dad doesn't even look at me. And Zaid, even he doesn't talk to me. Now you tell me what should I do? Just have a little patience, 
everything is going to be fine. No, it's been already so much time. 
Nothing is going to be fine. I'm fed up of all this. By the way are you free? Did you want anything from me? No I was just thinking 
why don't we go out somewhere? -Where?
-Anywhere. Like a mall or to the movies? I just want to go out. Actually, Nosheen, it isn't possible today. I'm
a little busy. I've to go out for dinner. Where? Can I come with you? No, actually I'm going 
for dinner with Faiq, so... Okay, it won't be appropriate
for me to come along, right? Yeah. Okay, have fun. I'll look for
something to do in the house. This one's nice. Oh, once again, how are you? I'm good, what a pleasant surprise. What are you doing here? There is a lady who lives here and I
have a plan to have dinner with her. You tell me, are you coming 
from somewhere or going somewhere? Neither I'm coming from anywhere, 
nor I'm going anywhere. Wow, means you stay so
dressed up even at home? Yeah, I like it. That's nice. One
should stay dressed up. One may have to go
out anywhere at any time. Actually I had a plan to go with a friend,
but she ditched me at the last moment. That's really sad. So what 
about this preparation now? I don't know, I might change.
I wish I could go somewhere. By the way, if you want you can join us. Oh, really? But wouldn't Aima mind? Well, I don't know, she shouldn't mind. -That's great, then I'll come along.
-Sure. Really? She has proved 
to be a hidden warrior. Let her get back, 
I'll take all reports from her. As soon as he marriage got fixed, 
she forgot her oldest friend. Dear, how can she forget you? You are her best friend. Forget it, auntie. If that was the case 
she would have told me for sure. She is going out on dinner with her would
be husband and I don't even know about it? She didn't even know it herself. She got to know at the last
moment when Faiq called her. She got ready in a hurry and left. Other wise she would have
never hidden it from you. Okay I'll agree because you say so, 
but it doesn't looks like that to me. I'm sure she must have planned it
earlier. I'll ask her when she returns. Okay, she'll be back in a while.
You can ask her whatever you want. Complain to her as much as you like. By the way, should I say something? Okay, first tell me since when did you start
taking permission to talk to me? I am really happy to see you so content. Faiq is a nice guy and he
is going to keep Aima happy. With God's will. I just wish that may God keep them
really happy. May he gives them good fate. -Amen.
-Amen. Have you guys seen Nosheen? Nosheen? Isn't she home? I didn't see her since evening.
I thought she might be in her room. But now I have looked for her in
the whole house but I can't find her. So I thought of asking you both. Call her and ask. Why don't you call her. 
I can't find my phone right now. Hello, Nosheen, where are you? Dinner? With whom? All right, okay. What happened? Where is she? She is with Faiq and Aima. Have you asked your sister in law
what she wants for dowry? Sister, I don't find it
appropriate asking her this. Look, I'm just saying that in your favor. This way you'll know if they want any dowry
or not. And if they do what do they want? Why did you take Nosheen along? This
was supposed to be your special moment. And you involved Nosheen in it? You're so stupid. I'm busy right now. -What do you think?
-What the hell? That if we don't remind you that
doesn't mean that we all have forgotten. Are you going to do whatever you want? Have you forgotten what you have done? Who the hell are you to forgive me?
