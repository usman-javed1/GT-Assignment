From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you I just want to tell you
everything honestly. I can't see you being angry. Iâ€™m not angry with you, Aima. I'm just angry with me that I was
expecting more than required from you. Don't kill me, don't kill me. -You won't do it the easy way, will you?
-I'll tell you, don't kill me. Look, I didn't do it myself.
Someone had asked me to do it. -Stop lying!
-I am telling you seriously, -I was paid by someone to do it.
-Who paid you? There is this guy, Faisal.
He is a very cheap man. -Faisal who?
-There is this guy. And his girlfriend asked him
to do all this. Zaid, you were absolutely right. Everything has become like it was earlier. I just can't believe how did such a miracle happen in my life? The thing what you can understand
isn't a miracle. You're right. This, all of this is God's work. We humans aren't able to understand it. My God knows. How much I yearned for dad's love. For him patting my head,
looking at me with affection. You know, how much I cried and prayed. You're such a strange girl, Aima. You cry when you're sad,
you cry when you're happy. What can I do, Zaid? I have no other way to express my feelings. And right now I've got mixed feelings. -Why?
-I'm happy. I'm happy that God has listened to me. Ad sad because why did I lose hope from God. I also wonder how did
all this happen so suddenly. And I'm content because I have regained my place in dad's heart. And I'm just happy seeing you like this. You know, you're like an open book. Yes I am. But not everyone can read me. Just a few special people. -What are you looking at?
-I'm looking at you. -Why?
-It feels good to see you happy. You know I was just waiting
to see your face like this. And finally it feels like we have
no boundaries between us. -And it feels nice.
-Thank you so much, Zaid. -What for?
-For believing in me. For supporting me. And to take out time for me. And... for forgiving me. Okay, then, do one more thing for me. -Yes?
-Please don't cry. Keep smiling, you look good. That's more like it. What is your problem, Faisal? Here your drama is never-ending,
and there my family is on my nerves. Try to understand.
My brain is going to explode. What do you mean
that you can't send your family like this? Do they belong to a royal family
that I need to get rules made out for them? Convincing my dad is my headache,
just send your family tomorrow at any cost. And one hour means one hour. Bye. -She isn't here yet?
-I have called her, why don't you start? I want to talk to you all
about something very important. I have selected a proposal for
Nosheen and fixed her marriage. The marriage will be solemnized
at 8:00 pm on Saturday. There will be just a few people from
the family in the ceremony not many. Right after that, the groom's family
is going to take Nosheen with them. Zaid... Zaid, you'll have to make arrangements
for the dinner, for around 50 people. Okay, Dad. They haven't asked for
any dowry or anything, but still, just see
what you want to give. At least, tell me who is the guy,
how is the family? Enough, Dad. Enough with your drama. Do you think that I'm going to get married
and that too with a guy of your choice? Are you insane? -Don't you have a little pity
-Dad, calm down. -in your heart?
-Pity? -What are you trying to do?
-Just shut up, don't you dare to interfere! You have given her too much freedom. If you'll interfere I'm going
to slap you too. -Do whatever you want, I won't marry.
-Nosheen, stop misbehaving with dad. Do you see how rudely she is talking to me? Okay, Dad, calm down. Listen,
please sit down, have some water. -Don't get into this.
-Please, Dad, calm down. You know very well what they have done. Brother, brother, listen to me. Look, whatever it is, whoever is guilty,
just forgive her. -Just forgive her.
-Oh, you shut up! I don't know who has poisoned your ears. -You are hitting the honor of your home.
-Are you talking about the honor of my home? -Dad, Dad, please.
-I have covered the honor of my home, -that your daughter has tarnished.
-Nosheen, go to your room. -Let's go to your room, Nosheen.
-Take her and get lost! -Let's go, Nosheen.
-She is such a cheap girl. Come, Nosheen, let's go. Mother, Mother, you... -Mother, please sit.
-What just happened? -Please sit.
-What is wrong with this house? What's wrong? My God. I can't believe my eyes, what I have just seen. I just don't understand what happened
to brother. He has never done like that. Nosheen must have done
something wrong, Mother, because of which Dad was so furious. But I have never seen him
this angry all my life. Okay, just don't worry and take rest now. No, I can't take rest. Mother, why are you taking stress.
Doctor has told you not to. How can I not take stress? I am not a selfish person, look at the environment in the house. How can I just mind my own business? The environment of the house
can't improve by your taking stress. Brother doesn't like to raise his voice
with the women of the house. And today, he raised his hand. I'm sure, I'm sure my house
is under someone's evil eye. At times, one doesn't need an outsider
to destroy the house. Insiders are enough for that. I'm sure, whatever decision
dad is taking it is right. Mother, Nosheen must have done something due to which Dad is compelled
to take this decision. Still, hitting her in front of everyone, and getting her married
without her consent. I just don't get it. What kind of justice is this? Mother, don't try
to think too much about it. May be all of this is better for Nosheen. She'll get matured after marriage. Please ignore all of this right now. Dear, I'm very worried. I'm actually worried, she is my niece. My heart is tearing because of her pain. She is Dad's child. He must be in greater pain
than you, right now. And you say it yourself that at times
taking tough decisions becomes necessary. No. I don't think it's a tough decision. I think it's a wrong decision. I, I'm going to talk to brother myself. Please, Mother, please don't do that. Even before this, whenever
you got involved in her issues, you have become the bad one in it. Nosheen has dug this ditch for herself, and she is going to bear
the consequences herself. Mother, if you really want the
best for her then just pray for her. Come on. Come and lie down. You have hit your adult daughter
in front of everyone. Would you like to clarify, Mr. Azmat? It's better
that we don't discuss it right now. You can do whatever you want
to, and no one can question you. You taunt me a thousand times on my single
mistake, and it is your fault actually. You have put the burden of your
negligence on my shoulders so easily. Just because of a slap? Means, even this is my fault? Not fault, call it a crime. You haven't given your children
their right, that's a huge crime. Am I going to deprive
them of their right? I'm their mother,
I have given birth to them. It's not enough to give them birth only. Consideration, attention, upbringing, one has to become their shade,
one has to teach them the worldly affairs. It was their right,
in which you have failed. Almas, you have been completely dishonest. I tired my level best that my wife never faces
a thing called poverty. There should be no financial problems. Nobody should point fingers at my children. That she can bring them up properly,
take care of them. I hired servants in the house so that
there is no problem outside the house too. so that you can stay
with the children care free. But sadly, the time you have bought
for your children you spent it on your entertainment. Shopping, friends' meet-up,
make overs, kitty parties. And today, I can say this
with full confidence  that some things can't be bought. Do you mean to say that your children
have been brought up on the streets? They are brought up on the streets,
you can say that. They have been brought up by servants. They don't have any manners
nor any etiquette. Raising three children together
isn't easy, Azmat. What else have you done? Tell me, what have you done? Besides, Zaid has been with Shabana
all his childhood. If she has fed him food for a few days,
then has she replaced his mother? If you had been home ever, you would have
known how much three children tease you. I wish. I wish, I didn't get so busy in earning
money and making a future for my children. I was mistaken that there
is a woman at my home Who is looking after my home,
who is raising my children. You have an idea about your hard-work only. Only I know how I've raised these children. Yes, it's not that difficult. Children are dependent on their
parents just for the first few years. After that one has to be
with them just like a guide.  One has to answer the questions they ask. The real job is to become their shadow, to keep an eye on their activities. Anyway, no mother can stay
with her kids for 24 hours. And you are telling me
to sacrifice all my hobbies? Yes, it would have been better
 if you had sacrificed them. Because hobbies can be taken up later on, but the childhood of children
can never return. God hasn't placed heaven
under a mother's feet just like that. It's really painful for me to say
that you are an unsuccessful mother, an unsuccessful wife. The slap that Nosheen has got today, that hasn't hit her,
but to your upbringing. Hello, yes, Faisal? Dad didn't agree. Dad has crossed
all limits of misbehaving. I have no other option other than
running away from home. Everyone has died for me. Just make arrangements, I'm going
to run away from this home before Saturday. -Did you call me?
-Sit down. This is the boy's picture, take a look. And if you want, show it to your daughter. He is much elder than Nosheen. He is bald too. The guy isn't of much age,
it just seems so. He is just 32. Are you aware of what you are doing? This guy is too old, and weren't they ashamed either
for asking Nosheen's hand in marriage? They didn't give the proposal,
in fact I was the one who initiated it. I am telling you,
just ask them to excuse you. I'm going to look
for an appropriate match for her. You wasted the time
that I had given you for this task. Just give me one more week. Not at all. That's my final decision. Don't you have even a little consideration
for your daughter? Can't you stand Nosheen
even for a little longer in this house? So that we can look
for an appropriate match for her? And by the way, why do you think
that I am being cruel to Nosheen. I couldn't find any better
and appropriate match for her. They are nice people. They are a well off family,
the guy has a personality. I know him personally.
He'll take good care of her. I'd still say that you are rushing it. There is a reason. There is a reason
to it that's why I am compelled to rush it. -It's my compulsion.
-What compulsion? My experience is telling me that this girl
has reached to a point of being shameless, that the sense of crime
has died in her too. My heart is telling me that if we
don't marry her off as soon as possible then she is going to cause such a mischief
that we can't even think of. At least our dignity is safe yet. Please, please let me explain her once.
I'll talk to her. We'll look for a good proposal for her. 
Please don't be so cruel to her. I've told you all ready, I'm not
getting her married to some ordinary guy. I'm doing what is best for her. Get her ready. 
The groom's family is coming to meet her. Honestly, Aima, 
I'm really happy to see you happy. I faced many crisis 
and got rid of them so quickly too. I just wish such a time never comes again. Oh, why have you started talking 
like old aunties? Are you okay? I have to share 
so many gossip with you. You know, that Kinza? I don't think that there affair 
is going to last much longer. The other day, Zaid proved 
that he isn't that crazy after Kinza. What did he do? I was with him, she was calling him and
he said right after picking the call that, "If someone's not replying then you
should understand that he is busy." So, what does that mean? So, stupid, this means she isn't that
important for him as we thought she is. I means, she is not even near our level. But why did he do so? Idiot, because of you. Because of me? Yes, your issue was going on at that
time so his temper was high already. And even if I had said something
to him, he would have scolded me. He was that mad. Aima, what's up with you? Say something, 
is you tube light switched off? No, it's nothing like that. 
He worries like that for everyone. Not at all, he doesn't
do this for everyone. He just says that we both are equal for him, 
but he gives you more importance. At times I really feel jealous. No Zoya, he is as concerned 
for you as he is for me. -Don't worry.
-Anyway, we just drifted away from the topic. I think that there are no chances
of Kinza to become Mrs. Zaid. Is everything okay in your home? Why has everyone walking around 
with a long face. Or do they look like that? Actually, dad is getting Nosheen married. Oh really? Well, thank God. I support uncle's decision 
for the first time. Girls like her deserve it. What has she done to you
that you're saying this? What? Don't you know? You really don't know what she has done? I have no idea, but dad 
is really angry with her. She must have done something wrong. But still, I feel that it's unfair to her. Now I know. Didn't Zaid tell you anything? What didn't he tell me? Everything. He has done so much, 
but he didn't tell you? -Did my daughter have something to eat?
-Yes, I did, Mama. That's very nice. One shouldn't
stop eating even if one's angry. Angry at what? That thing which your dad did. He called me a while ago. Why? To tell you something more? No, he was apologetic, 
but I didn't listen to him at all. I said, who the hell are you 
to hit my daughter. You shouldn't have said that. He is my dad, I misbehaved with him. But, Nosheen, what's wrong is wrong. And he is getting me married. Nosheen, I've said him a lot of things, 
but he doesn't listen to me. They are coming to meet you. Nice, I'm there would-be
daughter-in-law, they should meet me. Don't worry it's a nice family. 
They are well off. And they have a bungalow in our area. -I mean, it's almost perfect.
-Almost? Yes, Nosheen, the guy is a little older. Not too much, just a little. That happens when it's 
an arrange marriage. Not a big deal. Your dad has sent this picture of the guy. That's nice. Let me see. What is it? Didn't you like him? He's okay. In fact it would be better
if he adopts me instead of marrying me. Stop it, Nosheen, he's not that old. I'm telling the truth, Mama, there must be 
at least a gap of two generations. One has to make some sacrifices 
in an arrange marriage. Everybody has some qualities 
and some faults. Now, he is older so he is going
to take care of me like dad too. What's wrong with you? 
How are you talking? What happened, Mama? 
Did I misbehave with you? No, no. Neither you are arguing, 
nor being stubborn. You are talking so politely, 
it seems weird. Oh, Mama, I am practicing to talk politely. There are not much days left 
for me in this house. What happened? Did I say something wrong? No, that's a really good thing. 
It's just that I don't believe it. Oh, come on. Believe it, 
why do you doubt so much? Looks like my daughter is mentally disturbed
by knowing about her sudden marriage. Oh, okay. But, Aima, Why didn't Zaid tell you all this? What could have Zaid told me, Mother? That his sister has done 
such a bad thing to me? He is hiding from me 
because he is so ashamed. Even I won't be able to look him
in the eye after knowing all this. Really, it must be challenging for him. Mother, I don't want to see Zaid 
and dad anymore in stress. That's why I've... forgiven Nosheen. Aima, you know, you're my pride. -Mother, shall I ask you something?
-Sure, go ahead. What do you think when you forgive people? -By thinking of God's plan.
-What plan, Mother? You know that God says That the way you expect me to forgive you, you should also forgive others 
the same way. The one dearest to God is the one who forgives others. Whatever problem God puts us in, 
he gives us relief with that too. Yes, Mother, you are right. With every passing day, my belief on God is getting even stronger. You can see for yourself, The house in which God gave us difficult
relations in sister and Nosheen's form,  to test us, he has given us ease in the same house  
in brother and Zaid's form. That's why, we should forgive them. Or else it will be counted 
as thanklessness of God. Aima? What are you thinking? -Nothing.
-Then why are you smiling? I am thinking that my mother's heart
isn't made of gold but of diamond. Look, dear, remember one thing. You will come across good, bad, 
all sorts of people in your life. You have to face good and bad times too. It's just that we should stay strong. And most importantly, we must always have faith in God. If one faces bad times, God always
does something good in those times too. Like Zaid and dad in our lives. Yes, you are absolutely right. Zaid is a very nice boy. See how he solved our issue so nicely, he never thought about himself. We should be indebted to him. No doubt, that kid is one in a million. He takes care of me a lot. And I have never felt the need of a son 
because Zaid was always there. I always wished to have Zaid 
as my son in law. But, the situation in the house 
is telling something else. Anyhow, my God is the Glorious one. My Lord.
