From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you I want that you... divorce me. -Greetings, auntie.
-Greetings, I am so happy to see you. Didn't you miss us since so long? Missed you all a lot, that's why I'm back. How are you doing, Dad? Look, please don't start that
again. I'm already too tired. If Sania had messaged you right now
then you wouldn't have been tired. Oh, shut up, Nosheen,
what are you saying? I'm saying the truth. You aren't even happy about our
kid, you are concerned with him at least. I know that you haven't forgiven me. How can you say that? Because I am unhappy. I am unhappy even after trying so hard. If you don't get happiness through
a relationship, then you should end it. And at times one has to break the
relationships for others' happiness too. Zaid has asked me to leave his home. -How dare he ask my daughter to...
-He is very daring. He is sending a notice in few days too. What notice? You are pretending to be so
innocent as if you don't know anything. What's wrong, Nosheen?
Why are you sitting like this? I thought to make breakfast for Faiq, so, when he woke up and went to
the washroom, I went to the kitchen. Okay, then? I made breakfast for him with so
much difficulty early in the morning, and he left without even telling me. Oh, Faiq did very wrong. but you should have told him, and
maybe he had something important to do that's why he left without telling. Auntie, he knew that I
was in the kitchen, he could have at least
told me before leaving. Anyway, don't lose heart. I thought he will be happy by seeing it. Let him know in the evening, he will
get happy even by listening about it. You know what? I have been angry
a lot of times on what people said, but I have never got hurt
by listening to anyone. Neither had I ever tried to please
anyone but I was still happy. And now when I'm trying to please someone then I am the one getting hurt,
why is it like that? Because now you have
started caring about people. And this is the beauty of a human that his good deeds start
taking over him gradually. It is a little difficult in the beginning
but later on you will feel so good when everyone is with you. So wasn't I good earlier? When did I say that?
My daughter is the best. It's just that the feeling of caring
about others has aroused now in you. I made breakfast with such
difficulty and all of it is wasted. Why will it be wasted? If my daughter
has made it I am going to eat it. Bring it quickly. No, this has turned cold, I'll
make fresh breakfast for you. No, sit with me, I have to talk to you. You know, I thought that with
Faiq I'll make breakfast for you too. Really? Means now I
am going to get breakfast daily made by my
daughter along with Faiq. I can try to make it daily, but I can't promise that. No, dear, no need to make it daily either because I wanted that together,
we take care of you only, and you need our care too. Yes, but I have some duties too. There is a lifetime to do all this. Besides, you will have to
take care of Faiq after me. Please, don't say that,
you are my only friend. And Faiq is also tolerating
me just because of you, otherwise, he would have asked
me to leave the house long ago. It's nothing like that. He is little stupid,
that's why does mistakes. But once he understands,
he won't do anything like this. But still, I want you
to be with us always. Ya, okay, Iâ€™m not going
anywhere right now. Just don't worry. But may be Asim is going to
call me to Canada in a few days. I'll have to go there. No, you aren't going anywhere.
Say no to Asim. I won't let you go anywhere from here. Oh, I'm not going right now, but, Nosheen, I'll have
to go to him in a few days. No, I'm going to talk to Asim myself. I won't let you go. And if he misses
you so much, he will come here. You are not going to leave us. Okay, fine, I'm not going anywhere,
I am here with you, happy now? Pick it up, who is calling? Hello? Yes, brother. I'm
good, how are you doing? Brother, please try to
understand, I am at my in laws. I can't come whenever
I want at at any time. What's wrong? Let me talk to him. Hello, greeting, how are you doing? I'm good too. Don't worry, driver will
drop her as soon as Nosheen gets ready. Really? Sure do come over,
it's like you own home. Fine, I'll tell her to get ready. Okay. So bad, he is calling you with so
much love and you are saying no. Here. He is coming to pick you.
Get ready nicely and then go. But you haven't eaten
anything since morning. I'll bring some fruit for
you then you may go, okay? No, Aima, at times there is
no solution to some things. And if there is a solution, a person
becomes really helpless at times. I know it very well. We all have put a lot of
pressure on you, right? I, I want that you divorce me. Auntie, Faiq's number is switched off. Nosheen, he might
have stopped over with his friends. Yes but his phone is off, auntie. Yes, that's worrisome. But may be he didn't charge his phone. I am getting really worried. Don't worry, he will be here in a while. Auntie, if you hurt someone intentionally, will you ever be able to stay happy? It is true, that the one who has hurt someone
is always rebuked by his conscience and he never stays at ease until the other person
doesn't forgives him by heart. Even God doesn't forgives
him till then, Nosheen. What is it? You look tensed,
what's going on inside you? Auntie, I have always
hurt Aima intentionally. If I will ask for her forgiveness,
will Faiq be okay with me too? No matter if anything
else gets okay, but asking for forgiveness
often satisfies the heart. If you think that way,
you can apologize to her. Will Aima forgive me? If you sincerely ask for forgiveness
she will definitely forgive you. Faiq's calling. Hello, Faiq. Who is this? Who are you? This is my husband's number. -Your husband has met an accident.
-What? How? How is he doing now? Nosheen, who was it? Who was calling? Nosheen, at least tell me something. MY daughter's life is ruined. She has to face so much sorrows. Auntie, please be strong. Look, if you are going to do that,
who is going to take care of Nosheen? Aima, how is she going to bear so
many responsibilities at such a young age? We all are here to take care of her. Yes, but... Yes but before her child could be born the
father of her child has left the world. This is what God wanted. We all are helpless in front of Him. What else can we do
other than being patient. But Azmat, she is so young,
how is she going to do all this? If God has put her in a trial then
He will definitely find a way for her too. Oh God! What is this trial
that you have put us in? Oh God! Give Nosheen patience, 
give us patience. What is Nosheen doing? She is sleeping, Dad. Give her something to eat, she is in her home for two days
and hasn't eating anything properly. Yes, I gave her breakfast. Neither she is eating or drinking, 
nor she is saying anything. Has Nimra eaten anything? I
am trying but she is crying all the time. I am unable to handle her. And Nosheen, neither
she is crying nor talking. God will have mercy. You keep crying, think of that mother whose
grown up son is taken away, what must she be going through? What is her purpose of life now?
Your daughter still has a reason to live. Just have patience. Have patience. Oh Lord, give us patience. I was looking for you in the whole house. When did you wake up? Come on now, eat something right away. I am not hungry. Nosheen, why aren't you hungry?
It's very important for you to eat. If not for yourself, then fro your child. And look, how rough your hair have gotten. Come on, get up, get fresh, take
a shower, I will iron your clothes, okay? -Aren't you angry with me, Aima?
-Why would I be angry with you, Nosheen? You know, I have always
deliberately given trouble to you. I have always teased you deliberately. I even took away Faiq from you. But you know, Aima? 
Faiq has never become mine. Because even if you take away something
from someone, it doesn't become yours. Faiq had never loved me, Aima. I am telling you the truth. Nosheen, stop now. 
All this is in God's hands. -Just don't...
-Yeah, you're right. God as punished me. He has shown me that I am worth nothing. No matter how much I want something,
it can't happen until He wants it. No doubt. God is our Lord. A lot of Faiq's friends are calling. I have told them that auntie is
going to stay at our place for a while. You did right, besides it's not right for
her to stay at her home  in this situation. Zaid, I was thinking that you did the right thing to tell me that
dad wants me to get back home. If you hadn't told me I
wouldn't have known. Actually he asked for you
twice so I thought of telling you. Thank you. Zaid, may I ask you something? Sure. Are you okay? Yes, absolutely. Zoya wanted to talk to you, 
but you were busy. who told you that? Zoya was saying that you are ignoring her. It's not like that, 
actually I was also a bit busy. Zaid, what do you want? Why are you doing this? 
Why are you doing all this. What? Don't play with your life, Zaid. Just take a decision and decide
what you want to do with your life. One who is going through
it, only he knows how difficult it is to take 
a decision in some situations. I know it is difficult for you. But Zaid, for everyone's peace
you will have to take a decision. You are right. I might divorce Zoya. Or maybe I'll have to leave Aima. What kind of an answer is this? This is what I am feeling like. Zaid what is it that you want? I don't even know it myself
now what I actually want. I don't understand, how
are you going to decide then? What will your decision be based on? May be Aima wants it, 
or may be the family wants it. But I... Zaid, listen, you are too confused. But remember what I'm saying, Whatever decision you take,
please don't take it in haste. Either I take a decision in haste or
take my time, I have to take a decision. I'm with you. Nosheen must be so worried and so lonely. And now she has a
responsibility of a child too. And mother's problems are increasing too. I shall go to Pakistan. And I shall own the
responsibilities of Faiq. I think I shall take this step because this will solve a
lot of problems of my family. Yes , I shall do that. Mother has said yes, 
she is happy about it. But will Nosheen be able to accept it? Will she be able to accept me? Because it is my decision. Will she support me in this decision? Because, there are a lot
of issues in the society. May God have mercy, that
my decision proves to be right. -Hello, how are you doing, mom?
-I'm fine, Asim. I know, Mom. 
Till when are you going to cry? Don't know, Asim. These tears aren't going
to leave me until I'm alive. I know that you are in too much pain. But we all are going through the same
pain, still we will have to have patience. Otherwise, brother's soul will get hurt. I am having patience. A mother is still alive even
after her grown up son has died. This is patience. Mom, do one ting Please come here as soon as you can. No, Asim, how can I come right now? What about Nosheen? She is alone here. Who is going to give her
courage and console her? How is she doing now? How can she be? My daughter is completely broken. I can't bear to see her pain, Asim. She is so young. How is she
going to spend her lifetime? At least get hold of yourself for er, Mom. Asim, I'm fine. 
I'm not worried for myself. I'm just worried about Nosheen. God must have some plan regarding her. She is so young, anybody can marry her. Yes, dear, but this isn't so easy. Because in our society, 
a widow and that to with a kid, nobody accepts her. I pray for her every moment
that may God makes her life easy. May He becomes her best support. Amen. Because now she will have to take
care of Faiq's responsibilities as well. Amen, amen. Mom... -Can I ask you something?
-What is it? -You want me to get married, right?
-Yes. Okay, if I want to take brother's responsibilities,
will you ave any objection? Do you mean you want to own Nosheen and her child? Yes, yes Mom. I'm really sorry if you didn't like it. No, Asim, why wouldn't I like it? You have taken off burden from my heart. I was thinking about
it since so many days. I just didn't know how to ask you that. But, tell me one thing, Asim, I hope you are not saying it due
to any pressure, do you mean it? No, Mom, Faiq was my brother. What can be more for me than
taking care of his responsibilities? Stay blessed, stay happy. Thank you, Mom. Bye. I have got the notice. Just tear it and throw it away. I have decided to divorce Aima. Why are you leaving her, Zaid? Just because I don't like her? Or because I am going to
be the mother of your child? If that's the case then I lied to you. I'm not expecting. Did you lie then or are you lying now? I know that when a person
breaks someone's trust then he can never trust him again. I was never pregnant. If you want you can get my tests done. Such a huge fraud? Why, Zoya? Sorry, Zaid. I don't have the answers
to your questions. This was a small try just
to take Aima out of your life. What do you expect? Am I going
to forgive you after this nonsense? This mistake isn't forgivable. I deserve to get divorced only. I am going to my mom's,
just send me the papers. I will sign them. Auntie, did you offer your prayers? -Yes, I am just reciting Tasbeeh.
-Okay, then let's go have lunch. No, Nosheen, I just had breakfast. I don't feel like eating. Auntie, if you won't eat
then I won't eat either. You go eat my dear. I am feeling weird, my heart is sinking. I don't feel like eating anything. I can understand your feeling. Both of our pain is the same. Yes, of course. But your sorrow is much bigger than mine. May God make it easy for
you and gives you courage to bear this sorrow alone. I am not alone, auntie. You are with me. Yes, Nosheen, I'm with you.
And I'll always be there. But now I want to go home. Yeah okay, let's go home. Besides, I don't feel like staying here. At least Faiq's memories are there. But what are you going to do there? You should stay here with your parents. What do you mean? That is my home. Why will I stay here? The reason because of which it was
your home, he isn't in this world anymore. What are you saying, auntie? 
That's my home. And, so what if Faiq isn't
there. You are there with me. Just think over it. Nosheen, your life
isn't going to be as easy. I have no objection if
you want to stay here. Not at all, I can't leave you alone. We both will spend our lives together. But Nosheen is my
responsibility more than you. And I have talked to
Asim in this regard as well. I didn't get you. Actually, Asim wants to
own Nosheen with her child. Zaid, if I assure you that Aima won't stay alone, then? Will it be easier for
you to take a decision? Nimra has asked your
hand in marriage for Asim. What is wrong with you
guys? It is my life, and you didn't even find it
necessary to even ask me? Yes, Asim has said it himself to Nimra. Asim is my brother in law. Don't you guys even have
any regard for relationships? The reason because of which that
relationship existed, he isn't there anymore. Zoya, come with me, I am here to take you. But... No ifs and buts, no questions. Come with me.
