[0.13] From flowers and from buds
[4.57] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.16] When I saw you
[19.31] Amber, why delay this noble task?
[22.71] What do you mean?
[25.97] I mean to say that we won't keep
a very long engagement period.
[32.55] I thought that when I'll propose her,
[35.45] her reaction is going
to be the same as it was yours.
[39.89] What reaction?
[41.83] When we were practicing at least you
took my proposal seriously,
[45.75] and she started laughing, I mean seriously?
[48.27] Nothing is okay. The kind of things going
on in this house, how can anything be okay?
[54.34] -Why, Dad, what's wrong?
-You guys are going to tell me that.
[58.21] Tell me one thing, Zaid. Why did
you keep such a big thing from me?
[63.64] What are you talking about, Dad?
[68.76] What is this, you have come so late.
I've been waiting for you since morning.
[73.10] Sorry, Zoya, even after trying to finish
chores quickly, it took me this much time.
[78.42] It's okay now that you're here.
[81.67] -How did you come?
-I came with Zaid.
[85.84] Was he saying something about me?
[89.17] No, Zoya, nothing special.
He's just waiting for your response.
[100.13] By the way, all things aside,
but torturing him has its own pleasure.
[106.41] His condition right now
is like a fish without water.
[109.83] Aima I just don't believe
that Zaid has proposed me.
[116.01] You should believe it,
Zoya, because that's the truth.
[119.39] Aima I'm really confused,
why did he propose me?
[128.92] What's there to be confused about?
[131.68] He likes you that is why he proposed you.
[134.98] Really? He liked you as well.
[137.83] So me being special here?
I just don't get it.
[142.56] There is a lot of difference
between these to things, Zoya.
[145.73] Tell me, what's the difference?
[149.54] A person likes many people in his life.
[153.88] But marries just one.
[156.77] Whom he not only likes but loves too.
[162.14] So you want to say that Zaid loves me?
[165.99] Yes it is like that.
[167.46] Since when? Has he ever tried
to share it with you?
[172.35] No. He has never told me about it.
[177.09] He has proven to be such a secret lover.
[179.37] And you know that I don't believe in
this love and fairy tale kind of things.
[183.42] So believe in it now.
Why are you delaying?
[186.57] Tell him that you like him too.
[190.52] Excuse me? When did I tell you that?
[193.26] Why? Don't you like him?
[196.18] No, it's not like that
I don't like him,
[199.54] but I have never seen
him with that perspective.
[203.08] It's very complicated.
[213.54] Did brother mean what I have understood?
[221.53] If it is so, I have no objection.
[229.27] I have always like Zaid.
[233.19] And what can be a better
news for me than this
[238.23] that Aima and Zaid get together.
[244.13] But,
[247.84] sister...
[254.14] Aima, tell me what I should do?
[260.00] What does your heart tell you?
[261.91] At times I think that I should get married
to him, he's the best option for me.
[265.96] But at times I think that this is
going to be a wrong decision.
[269.42] What is wrong in it?
[271.28] I don't know. That's why
I have called you here
[273.58] so that you can pick
the best option for me.
[276.12] Why is that so, Zoya?
[278.03] Didn't you choose a guy
for you earlier as well?
[281.45] And you were so confident
about your decision.
[284.72] I had selected him my self,
[286.64] and I would have finalized my decision
after letting him meet you both first.
[289.80] Zoya, you should take such
an important decision yourself.
[295.83] Your own decision should be most important
for you rather than someone else's.
[301.26] Aima, I have always gone with your
decisions and your opinion matters to me.
[307.21] I depend on you on such things.
[311.16] That's why I don't understand whether this
relationship is going to work out or not.
[316.79] Okay, listen, do one thing. Just
close your eyes and ask your heart.
[322.47] Aima, please, all this
happens in movies
[325.05] that close your eyes and if you
see his face he is best for you.
[329.06] Sorry but it doesn't happen like that here.
[332.83] Zoya, just do it, it works.
[335.86] Aima, I want to take a practical decision.
[338.39] Which has got zero emotions and
zero feelings. you know what I mean.
[342.88] Zoya in a relation of love,
emotions and feelings are attached.
[349.33] But I don't want to do all this.
[350.95] I just want to see if marrying Zaid
would be right for me or not.
[361.89] Sorry, I think I said a bit too
much. I didn't mean it that way.
[367.29] Yeah, I know, you haven't
said anything wrong.
[373.12] I hop you get what I meant.
[378.38] Yes I understand that you
don't want to take any risks.
[381.54] But look, Zoya, there is a risk
in every relationship.
[385.69] Okay, tell me, if you were at my place,
what decision would you have taken?
[392.13] I... I would have said yes.
[396.53] You mean to say that I should say yes?
[400.32] Yes.
[407.28] And what's the reason to say yes?
[409.56] Zoya, there are a lot of reasons.
[412.43] You know him since childhood.
[414.60] He is a good person.
He keeps everyone happy.
[418.74] And above everything,
he is in love with you.
[426.06] I mean that Zaid is going to
be an ideal life partner for you.
[431.79] That's my opinion.
[434.05] You have to take the final decision yourself.
[459.28] Please sit, sister.
[460.96] What I need to say can
be said while standing.
[464.76] Yes, what is it?
[467.00] Have you talked to your brother?
[470.30] I don't understand, about what?
[472.44] Shabana, regarding
Zaid and Zoya's marriage.
[476.21] No, sister I haven't talked to
brother regarding this issue.
[482.35] Really? Why is he suddenly
worried about this relationship?
[486.97] Someone must have
said something to him,
[488.91] otherwise he was happy
about it till last night.
[490.94] He was congratulating me happily.
[493.87] Someone must have said
something to him after that.
[497.92] Sister, I have no idea about that.
[501.09] By the way, there aren't many people
in the house who can poison his ears.
[505.39] Do you get what I'm saying?
[508.98] What can I answer you regarding this?
[512.64] Fine, just keep your stance on this issue.
[516.37] Because if I get to know that you
are the one who has mislead him,
[521.84] then you will see what
I'm going to do. Got it?
[552.12] So, what did she say?
[555.04] She is still thinking.
[557.22] What is this, Aima? I sent you
there so that you can convince her.
[562.15] I was expecting a good news.
[565.47] Look, Zaid, I tried to convince
her as much as I could.
[568.64] But after all she has to take the decision.
[571.85] It's not like that, you should have
asked her to say yes by saying anything.
[579.60] You... do you love her so much?
[585.98] Love.
[589.81] Is this what you call love?
[594.91] How would you know,
you've never loved anyone.
[598.21] I know it.
[600.01] I always feel with every
girl that I am in love with her.
[604.84] That's why I'm confused this time.
[609.74] But if you're saying
it then I should agree
[611.83] because you often tell
the right things about me.
[617.53] You call me an open book,
what are you yourself, huh?
[624.66] What is it that's bothering you?
[627.31] I don't know, everything is
happening opposite to my expectations.
[631.17] I was sure that you will convince her but
[636.34] even this expectation
of mine didn't come true.
[638.14] Look, Zaid. As much as I could
convince her, I did it for you.
[644.22] I don't want to force
her to take any decision.
[648.28] But why, what's wrong with that?
[650.47] Look, I want that she likes you
herself and thinks about you herself.
[654.87] If she takes a decision
after liking you
[657.37] then she is going to stay
satisfied with it all her life.
[661.26] Look, even you have taken all your time,
thought over it and then proposed to her.
[669.17] Now it's her turn. Give her some time.
[672.70] If she clears out all her doubts
and likes you and get married to you
[677.92] then it is going to be good for you.
[680.08] And what if she rejects me?
[682.72] Why would she reject you, Zaid?
[687.18] You are underestimating yourself.
[690.54] She has got no valid reason to say no.
[695.05] She is going to say yes.
[708.22] Hello, yes Dad?
[711.94] I'm at home.
[717.84] Yes, she is with me.
[722.70] Everything all right?
[729.01] Okay, fine, good bye.
[732.92] What is it?
[734.22] It was dad. He was saying
to bring you to office along,
[736.92] he has to talk about something important.
[744.87] Since I have given you the phone
you are busy with it.
[749.19] So, what do you want, Mama, what
should I do? Just tell me and I'll do it.
[753.90] Just take a look at the garden, do
some work or take care of the house.
[761.88] Mama, please don't disturb me.
[764.37] And why should I take care of this house?
[766.58] Yes, very right, you've
been sent from the heavens
[771.05] you have nothing to do with this
house. You're always busy with the phone.
[774.41] Good for nothing.
[775.70] What is it, Mama? Why do you
keep taunting me all the time?
[779.26] I keep reminding you of your stupidities
[782.45] so that you won't do
any thing foolish again.
[786.27] You can use the phone later,
it won't go away anywhere.
[788.83] I have to talk to you about something.
[791.49] Go ahead.
[793.09] Have you talked to your dad
regarding Zaid and Zoya's marriage?
[799.89] What is wrong? Why are you laughing
like crazy? Have I told you a joke?
[803.15] I swear, Mama, it was a joke.
[805.62] You are no less than a stand up comedian.
[808.70] Stop this nonsense.
[810.11] Tell me, have you talked
to your dad regarding this?
[812.66] Your husbands keeps hiding from me.
[815.86] He thinks of me as a stranger, 
even after I am his daughter.
[819.46] If you think that I am
going to poison his ears,
[821.99] going to complain about you guys to him,
[824.65] And he is going to say, yeah, dear Nosheen,
only you are wise in this house
[829.20] the rest are just useless.
[831.66] What a joke!
[834.13] You could have said
that in a simple way too.
[835.72] I just had a doubt so I asked.
[838.60] Mama, it's all because of this doubt. 
You guys never stop doubting me.
[842.94] Don't try to act so innocent. Whenever I've 
doubted you I have been proven right.
[848.48] Okay just don't dig out old issues.
[850.98] There are going to be new issues
in this house, just focus on them.
[855.48] I can understand very
well what you want to say.
[859.25] It's good that you understood,
you won't have to cry later.
[862.77] Just leave my home and it's issues alone.
[867.79] Listen to me carefully,
[870.08] don't you dare spit venom 
about this marriage.
[873.48] Neither to me nor to anyone else.
[875.87] Why would I need to
interfere in your problems?
[879.26] Bring your own blood
as your daughter in law.
[882.23] But remember, a confidant of
the house may ruin the house.
[886.56] Just stay away from my problems.
It's my house, I'll handle it myself.
[890.44] Enough now, I forgot what I came to say.
[893.82] Is there still anything left to say?
[897.49] Yes, we'll go to the market tomorrow. 
You are going to come with me.
[900.30] We'll leave at 10:00 in the morning.
[902.20] All right, Mama, I'll be ready.
[905.49] That is if I get up.
[922.22] Actually, the reason
to call you guys here was
[924.43]  that there is a confusion created at home.
[927.37] I just wanted to clear it.
[930.36] Where there is happiness coming to
this house, there is a little sadness too.
[935.48] There is confusion and worries.
[937.86] Regarding what, Dad?
[939.79] Let me tell you. I want that
you both clear it yourselves
[943.25] that you love each other
and want to marry each other.
[950.38] What's is it?
[952.83] Did I say something wrong?
[957.20] Sims, dear, you tell me.
[959.62] What? What, Dad?
[962.34] Do you like Zaid?
[966.56] No, Dad, Zaid is just a good friend
[970.72] and there is nothing as
such going on between us.
[974.39] Means you guys don't like each other?
[976.21] No, Dad...
[978.68] you have misunderstood.
[980.65] And you, Zaid? Do you
have no feelings for her?
[985.98] Dad, I don't understand 
what is this confusion about?
[989.30] Answer me what I am asking you. 
Do you like Aima?
[993.20] Do you want to marry her?
[996.85] Dad, I like Zoya and I want to
marry her. Aima is just my friend.
[1003.51] And I don't understand 
what are you confused about?
[1006.86] The confusion is that I...
[1010.69] Nothing, just leave it.
[1014.81] Dad, has anybody said something to you?
[1018.56] No, nobody has said anything.
[1022.50] Dad, are you unhappy about
my and Zoya's marriage?
[1027.56] No, I have no objection.
[1032.93] Dad, look if you have any kind
of concern please let me know.
[1036.39] Because honestly, I don't want to
take any decision without your consent.
[1044.34] Dad, trust me, if you want 
then I won't get married here.
[1048.99] No, I'm happy about this relationship.
[1055.28] So do I have your permission now?
[1081.17] Zaid what is wrong with you? 
Why are you feeling so low?
[1087.47] You know,
[1089.88] It's been three days. She hasn't
talked to me. No call, no message.
[1094.89] Look, where you have waited
for so long, just wait a little more.
[1099.16] The decision is going to be in your favor.
[1101.67] Aima, how can you be so certain?
[1104.94] And why are you so uncertain?
[1107.42] Because I know her very well. Has she
every taken a proper decision till now?
[1111.75] Neither she has any heart
nor brains. She is totally mad.
[1115.12] And you know what? She has no
valid reason for her likes and unlikes.
[1118.10] That's why I'm worried. If she declines
me, I'm going to be really humiliated.
[1124.52] Nothing of this sort is going to happen.
She is going to accept you, you'll see.
[1127.91] Well, I hope.
[1133.48] -Zoya!
-Zoya, come, come sit.
[1138.47] So, sorry guys, I came at this hour 
and that too without informing.
[1142.99] No problem, please sit down.
[1147.74] Why are you being so formal. As if
you used to inform earlier before coming.
[1152.63] I wanted to talk to you.
[1156.25] I was just thinking about
talking to you in private or...
[1159.28] -I'll just leave.
-No, wait.
[1162.79] Whatever you want to say, you can
[1163.95] say it in front of Aima. 
I don't hide anything from her.
[1166.15] Actually, I came to tell you my decision.
[1173.03] And please keep your emotions and
feeling aside and think practically, okay?
[1183.05] I hope you can understand my position, 
Zaid, why I took this decision.
[1189.18] And our friendship shouldn't
get effected because of it, Zaid.
[1192.00] It's a request.
[1194.88] It's okay, you know.
You have all the authority.
[1198.17] You know, it's your right
whatever decision you take.
[1201.28] And you can tell me without any hesitation.
[1203.73] Zoya,
[1207.08] I hope you haven't taken a hasty decision.
[1210.64] No, I have taken my decision 
after giving it a lot of thought.
[1217.21] Zoya you don't need a preamble. 
I am strong enough to face rejection.
[1221.50] Please let me know your decision.
[1228.39] I just came to say that...
[1232.18] that...
[1234.02] I am...
[1237.25] ready to get married to you.
[1251.94] I'm ready.
[1255.41] Are you sure?
[1259.47] Zoya, I hope you aren't
saying this under any pressure.
[1267.43] So, did I surprise you?
[1271.38] I just thought you must be grateful, 
I should say yes to you.
[1277.43] I mean, you actually have
done a huge favor to me.
[1280.21] I am just thinking how am
I ever going to repay you.
[1283.58] Thank you.
[1286.73] Don't even try. You won't be able to
repay even if your whole life is spent.
[1291.68] Just spend your life with me,
you'll get to know then.
[1296.52] You wasted such a beautiful line on me?
[1299.33] Wasted?
[1301.73] Because I am not going to
believe all this what you're saying.
[1305.79] Really? Well, get used to it because I am
going to say things like that after marriage.
[1310.79] Zaid, I have accepted your
proposal five minutes ago
[1314.65] and you are ready for the wedding.
[1316.81] You are so desperate for me.
[1319.47] Oh, hello, keep your high hopes
to yourself. I wasn't desperate.
[1323.46] It's just that I didn't want to stay
stuck in between your yes and now.
[1326.82] Really? And what if I had
said no to you straight away?
[1330.60] The question is, why
would have you said no?
[1335.16] Are you checking his confidence?
[1340.68] Madam, why are you asking her? 
She is in my team.
[1344.85] What do you mean?
[1346.62] Means when I was
confused about your response
[1349.59] then my coach, my spiritual guide,
respected madam Aima Hassan
[1355.42] gave me the confidence that I
shouldn't underestimate myself.
[1358.78] and that I am such a perfect kind of
a person that no girl can say no to me, no.
[1368.97] Thank you, Aima.
[1370.97] Aima, is he telling the truth?
[1373.30] A little.
[1374.64] You boast him for no reason.
[1378.56] And you, there is no girl in
this world who can say no to me.
[1381.68] I was getting my marriage
fixed with someone else
[1383.23]  and you entered in between with flowers.
[1384.87] You must have thought that you
are going to lose such a pretty girl.
[1388.28] I love you, Zoya, please
marry me or else I'll die.
[1395.60] You know what, Aima?
I would like you to counsel her.
[1399.21] You know, tell her that she is
overestimating herself a little too much.
[1403.14] Yeah, please learn something.
[1405.40] It was different earlier. Now
your quarrels have become official
[1409.19] so I won't come in between them.
[1412.30] Well, you never came in between us, but...
[1415.82] Look I used to mediate between you
two earlier, but now you both are a couple.
[1420.66] Handle your issues yourself.
[1422.65] Okay, Zaid, tell me honestly. 
Were you jealous of Daniyal?
[1427.22] No, not at all. We both
have no comparison.
[1430.59] I am something else
and he is something else.
[1433.55] Oh, God, you are so self obsessed.
[1436.41] That's because you have 
boasted him so much.
[1439.33] She hasn't just boasted me, 
she boasts you a lot too.
[1443.25] Yes, you're right, it's all her fault.
[1448.40] Exactly, it's all her fault.
[1452.12] I am really happy for you both.
[1455.72] I love you, Aima.
[1458.34] I... I love you too, Aima. 
Really, thank you.
[1471.17] Why didn't brother Azmat come? It would
have been nice if he came along with you.
[1475.74] I asked him but he said that it will
take time till he returns from work.
[1480.23] And we have come casually right now.
[1481.91] Otherwise we will come formally
with the proposal, don't you worry.
[1485.27] We will celebrate this
happiness to the fullest.
[1489.19] Okay, fine.
[1490.70] What we'll do is, we will
fix a date in a few days.
[1495.93] Till then these kids will be
free with their exams too.
[1499.09] Yeah, sure. I have no objection.
[1502.87] By the way, 
when are your exams getting over?
[1505.86] Auntie, they'll be over this week.
[1509.69] And after that they will have to
take a new exam of their lives.
[1514.50] You are absolutely right.
[1516.53] And this exam is going to be as such
[1518.50] that they are going to forget
about the exams at university.
[1521.69] So tough.
[1525.32] Mom, you are scaring us.
[1528.96] Why are you scared?
[1530.70] She should have been scared if
she were going to a stranger's house.
[1535.07] She is coming to her auntie's house 
after getting married.
[1539.10] Why didn't you bring Aima?
[1541.47] I asked her a lot of times,
but you know how she is.
[1544.12] She just avoided it by making lame excuses.
[1547.63] Then you should have forced her to come.
[1549.60] She had to stay with her mother
because of her health condition.
[1554.59] Zoya, why don't you and
Zaid spend some time together?
[1561.54] Why so?
[1563.15] Besides me and Zaid 
know each other very well.
[1567.94] Even more than a couple knows each other.
[1571.16] It's okay that you know
each other very well,
[1574.61] but the relationship you
are going to be bonded with
[1578.59] you should consider that you guys are meeting
for the first time.
[1581.30] Right, sister? I hope 
you've got no objection.
[1585.42] I have never stopped them earlier,
why would I have any objection now.
[1592.88] Go then, why are you getting
bored by sitting among us?
[1598.17] And leave somethings for now.
[1600.03] Or else you guys won't have
anything to say or hear after marriage.
[1610.94] -They look beautiful together, don't they?
-Yes, by grace of God.
[1627.43] Don't tell me Zaid that you
are trying to be romantic.
[1630.97] Why not? I have a right
to be romantic with you.
[1635.69] It's so strange,
[1637.71] that we used to come here a lot too.
[1641.52] You're right, it's different.
[1644.74] But I would say, it's a good
kind of different. Beautiful.
[1653.05] Shall I ask you something?
[1655.93] Why did you say yes?
[1661.46] Because you proposed me.
[1663.73] What kind of answer
is this? Means if I hadn't proposed you
[1666.31] this would have never happened?
[1669.34] What wouldn't have happened?
[1670.96] This what we have among us now.
[1673.16] No, Zaid, of course not. 
This wouldn't have happened.
[1681.10] -What happened?
-No, I'm just curious.
[1684.43] About what?
[1685.46] I want to know what you think about me.
[1688.69] That you are my cousin, and you
are a very good human being and you are...
[1692.49] No, no, I'm not asking about that.
[1694.03] Then ask me an exact
question what you want to know.
[1698.66] My question is that what did
you think of when you said yes?
[1701.99] I mean while taking the decision
what was going on in your mind?
[1706.24] Is it that you said yes
just that I don't get hurt?
[1710.72] Zaid, do you want to ask me
that whether I like you too or not?
[1716.11] No, I mean, I know that you don't believe
in love and affection, etcetra etcetra.
[1720.53] But now we are getting into a relationship,
you know a life long relationship.
[1727.53] -Should I tell the truth?
-Yes, I want to know the truth.
[1732.67] And what if you don't like it, then?
[1737.96] I'd still want to know the truth.
[1741.30] Zaid, as much as I was thinking about
it, I was getting even more confused.
[1746.81] That's why I said yes to you
without thinking about it too much.
[1753.46] I'm sorry, Zaid. 
I don't feel anything for you.
[1758.52] You are just a friend to me.
[1763.19] Neither did I think about
you that way nor do I now.
[1768.53] That's why when you
proposed, I just said yes.
[1772.90] That I might develop
feelings for you later on.
[1777.76] Okay, tell me, did you have similar
feelings when you said yes to Daniyal.
[1782.84] One looks for some qualities in a guy
and some in a girl.
[1786.69] IF the qualities match only
then can things proceed.
[1792.24] That's why there is nothing for Daniyal.
[1795.64] So you mean to say that you had
similar feelings for me and Daniyal,
[1800.44] which as you said were zero feelings.
[1804.02] No, Zaid. Look, I trust you.
[1807.51] And besides, I chose you, not Daniyal.
[1812.23] And I had some concerns
regarding him as well.
[1815.71] What concerns?
[1817.19] I have heard that after marriage,
couples fight with each other a lot.
[1822.79] They don't stay happy.
[1824.16] Then they remarry and they
stop trusting each other as well.
[1830.21] But, I trust you. And I know that
you are never going to hurt me.
[1837.70] I promise you, Zoya. 
I am never going to hurt you.
[1841.53] I just wish that you develop feelings
for me as well the way I feel for you.
[1847.54] Don't worry about that, 
I have got a solution for that.
[1851.97] -What's that?
-I will start believing in Aima's theory of love.
[1856.59] And what's that?
[1857.89] That after you get married,
you find everything beautiful.
[1863.05] Cool breeze starts flowing.
[1865.48] And you fall in love 
with your life partner.
[1881.61] I need to talk to you, 
but I don't understand how to start.
[1889.20] Brother, you don't need to say anything.
[1894.72] I know what you have come to tell me.
[1900.02] I am ashamed of you, 
how can I look into your eyes.
[1905.02] No, brother, no.
[1910.04] Why should you be ashamed?
[1913.30] This has been the second time.
[1915.44] I have raised your hopes and then
broken them for the second time.
[1918.95] Brother,
[1922.06] you haven't deceived me.
[1926.09] It is
[1931.22] called fate
[1932.81] but I am unable to understand that
whatever I saw was I mistaken then?
[1940.00] Oh, brother, forget all these things.
[1944.90] Whatever the children decide, 
just accept it.
[1950.77] Yes, we will have to agree as
we don't have any other options.
[1956.19] Shabana, I called both of them to office.
[1959.69] I asked them directly and they both denied.
[1965.24] There is nothing between them.
[1970.45] It was my wish
[1972.42] that if any one of them
showed interest for the other
[1975.61] then I would have talked to them. 
They would have never let me down.
[1981.86] I wish they liked each other then...
[1987.73] only if...
[1989.92] Brother, you did whatever you could do.
[1998.73] If this relationship couldn't happen then
[2001.59] there must be some wisdom of God in it.
[2005.11] You are right.
[2007.32] And maybe I am unable to see that wisdom.
[2010.65] Brother, I would say
[2013.66] regarding this relationship 
I had my doubts too.
[2020.45] I didn't feel like telling you about it.
[2028.84] Okay, if you want should I
tell you about a proposal?
[2033.18] Yes, sister, sure.
[2035.91] My distant relatives, they are
looking for a girl for their son.
[2041.31] They asked about Nosheen
[2043.89] but their son is a little old for Nosheen.
[2049.11] So I thought I should ask you.
[2051.39] After all Aima belongs to our house too.
[2054.76] Meet him once.
[2056.94] If you like him, then with God's
will your marriage can be fixed.
[2061.66] All right?
[2066.24] -Mother.
-Yes?
[2072.48] Say yes to auntie on my behalf.
