From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned to chirp from you I was thinking that from tomorrow, me and
Faiq are going to eat when you are eating. No need for that. You can eat whenever
you like.  No need to worry about me. What do you mean?
Why shouldn't we worry? You know, there is
no fun in having food until some elder of the house
accompanies you. And Faiq hasn't eaten properly either. I'm filing a case on Zaid. He is going to come back to his senses
after spending some time in the lock up. What case? Well, he has given you
mental torture right after  and married again without your consent. Just read it, sign it and after that sign here as well. Here. How can this be, Shabana? I have hurt you. I have shown you a
dream about a beautiful, respectful life for your
daughter and then let you down. No you haven't let me down. But I was the one who gave
you my word. I promised you. Aima, what happened? Everything all right? Zaid has gone somewhere. Where has Zaid gone?
And what is this in your hands? Where did Zaid go? Zoya has asked for a divorce from Zaid. Get hold of yourself, what's wrong? Nothing is wrong,
everything is going to be all right. All this is happening because of me. All this is just for the time being,
it's emotional, nothing is wrong. Tell me where is Zaid? -I don't know...
-He must have said something! He left without saying anything,
I don't know. Okay hold this, I'll just check. There is a limit to shamelessness. That boy's parents are hiding. They didn't even bother to visit here. -Mom, why would they come here?
-Why not? If a person does a mistake then
he is supposed to feel sorry for that. But here there is no sign of being sorry. What should I say to someone else
when my own sister doesn't care. The world is like that, Mom,
and I am aware of it now. You're right And Zaid, he tried just once. And after that he sent Aima here. I don't think that Zaid had sent him. And to tell you the truth all
of this was done by uncle. Aima and Zaid have nothing to do with it. For God's sake, Zoya,
stop taking their side. Mom, I'm not taking anyone's side. I'm just saying that this
step wasn't taken by Aima. Someone must have
compelled her to do so,  but this doesn't mean at
all that she is innocent. Zoya darling, try to understand me. That girl is very sharp and cunning. She kept fooling you for so long through
her simplicity. She has deceived you. And remember one thing, those who
appear simple are actually very clever. You are right. The problem is that
actually you are very simple. You are the same inside out. But that girl and her mother
are cunning and clever. They are giving you the impression that without you they are
mourning in their house, but the reality is something else,
I have seen it with my own eyes. It's like a fest going on there. It had no effect on his father. He is still being stubborn,
but I won't spare him either. -I'll show him.
-What? -I'll show him.
-What? Just wait and watch what I am going to do. Zoya, what's going on?
Where has everyone gone? I don't know, they have gone inside. I think auntie needs to talk to
them about something important. Okay, just don't worry. It must be
something, I don't know about it right now. Zoya, I'm really anxious about Faiq. I'm very worried. He must be here somewhere, just
don't worry. Your make up will spoil. How can I not worry, Zoya? Whatever it is, is related to my marriage. Just call Zaid and ask what is wrong. Call him, quickly. How can everyone leave like that? Dial once more. He is disconnecting. Zoya, the way auntie has called
everyone, I think it's bad news. And I'm worried about
mom, she is so weak-hearted. -I'm really worried.
-Calm down, why are you thinking so negatively? Everything is going to be fine. -Please call Zaid.
-Yeah, I'm calling. Relax, relax. Where were you gone? I went for some work. What did Zoya say? We all need time to accept this fact. In fact everyone will take time. -Wait. I have to talk to you.
-Sure, go ahead. Zaid is at home. Did you talk to him? No, I didn't go to him. Aima, at least someone
needs to talk to him. Look, it's not just him who got effected you have been effected
with brother's decision too. A huge gap has been created
between us after this incident. I think that we should stay
away from each other for a while. But don't worry, everything
is going to be fine. Right now, just let it be. No, it's better to bridge the gaps as  soon as possible. Dear, you are his wife. You have the right to talk to him. To tell him how you feel. Go and talk to him. He doesn't want to talk to me. -How can I...
-Aima, I've got a bad feeling. The thing I fear the most is that is he going to accept
you as his wife or not. Don't worry, mother. We both will have to accept the reality
that he is my husband and I'm his wife. Yeah. Yeah, dear. He should realize that. If he isn't acknowledging it then you should make him realize that. Yeah, don't worry, I'll talk to him. Okay, now get ready. Let's go to the doctor and get
your tests done as well, okay? Okay. Are you sleeping? -Oh, Dad. No , no please tell...
-I'll come later. No please, sit down, tell me what it is? I wanted to talk to you. Did you meet Zoya? Yeah, I went to her place. She must be angry. Shouldn't she be angry? What did she say then? I wish she would have said anything. Dad. At least I would have had a glance of her. She doesn't even want to see my face, Dad. She doesn't want to meet me.
Do you know what that means? Get hold of you self, Zaid.
Use your senses. Her wound is still fresh. I already
told you that this is a tough time for her. The decision you have
taken, stay firm on it. Until you are stable how will I know
that I have taken the right decision? Just think what your plan is. How are
you going to manage both your wives? Because they both have a right on
you, you have to give them their rights. Stay away all day long, hurting
yourself won't do any good. You have signed your
marriage contract, so now both these girls
are your responsibility. And this is not an impossible thing. It
happens, people handle them, fulfill their relationships. The truth is that I gave you this
responsibility just for the same reason. Because I knew that
you can fulfill them well. I have a lot of hopes from you, son. I am sure that you won't let me down. Are you listening to me? Yeah. Shabana was telling me that you
haven't gone to Aima after getting married. -No.
-Son, Aima is very worried, try to understand her feelings. If you have given her your
support then hold her hand. We have a lot of expectations from you. Dad, I am a human too. Please
consider me as a person too. Aima is banking on me, you
have expectations from me too. Auntie's health is dependent
on me, but what about me? Does anybody care about me? You want me to be happy
and smile and accept everything as if nothing had happened?
And it happens all around? Please, Dad, think about me as well. I
have some feelings, some emotions too. I'm not a machine. Dad, give me some time.
I'll try to make everything all right. Why do you guys take Aima along with you? What kind of a question is this? It's a very simple question. Why don't you guys go alone?
Why do you take her with you? Mom, if she comes with me what's
wrong with that? She is my friend. Zoya, what are you thinking
about? You breakfast is getting cold. Yeah, Mom, I'm eating. The notice has reached there, I confirmed. Nothing, Mom, I just feel burdened. I was thinking if we
are doing the right thing. It's 100% right. Whatever he has done, he deserved this. Trust me, whatever your mom
is doing is for your own good. But I want your support in all this. I know my daughter is very confident. She won't let anyone do wrong to her. She always tells the truth
and stands firm on her decisions. But where is that Zoya? I know that my daughter isn't that
weak that she breaks down so easily. You are very strong. And we have to stand firm on
the decision that we have made. Yeah, Mom. I want my old Zoya
back who was full of life. Fearless, bold, who used
to look at life positively. You have to become the same Zoya. Yeah, Mom. Whatever had happened, just consider
it as a bad incident and forget it. Just think that you made a
big mistake which you corrected. And Zaid isn't the last option in this world. You have to move forward in your life. Believe me, after some time,
what you think is really difficult, you are going to forget all that. Come now, have your breakfast.
It's getting cold. Yeah, I'm eating. This guy never answers his phone. Hello, Zaid, where are you? -Hello, hello.
-Hello, Zaid? -Hello.
-Hello, who is this? Who are you, this is my son's cell phone.
Where is he? His car met an accident,
and a guy is lying unconscious inside. What? What are you saying? That's my son. Is he badly hurt? I can't tell you that right now. We are shifting him
to the hospital, please reach there. Which hospital are you taking him?
Please tell me. Yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming. Oh. my God! Faiq you are not bothered at all. I didn't get you. It was our wedding reception
yesterday and your mother didn't come. Did you talk to her? -No.
-Then talk to her. She has done so wrong to us.
She humiliated us in front of everyone. What can I say? I wanted to convince
her but she didn't want to come. Faiq she has humiliated us. This was her way of taking revenge. That way I can say too that your brother and dad have humiliated
me by not showing up at the reception. Are you comparing? I'm not comparing, I'm just saying that if my mother didn't come
then your family wasn't there either. Faiq, the girl's family is responsible for the
wedding event. And this was the reception. And people only object when the host
of the event isn't present not the guests. Your mother should have been
there, it was her responsibility. She did very wrong to us. Why don't you understand, Nosheen,
nobody is happy with what we have done. So many people have been hurt. Everybody is mad at us, and don't know
how long they are going to stay that way. But till when, Faiq? 
There is a limit to everything. I don't know, and besides
why are you saying it now? You were even ready to
elope with me, now bear it. We haven't committed a sin that
your mother is treating us like this. Whatever we did was permissible. At times people get hurt 
by permissible things too. And we haven't hurt
just one but many people. Faiq, it's important that we stay happy. People never get happy. And your mother should consider
the fact that who makes her son happy. My happiness is important, Nosheen, but mothers have some wishes too. And my mother was really happy
when I was getting married to Aima. Oh, but till when is your mother
going to keep taking Aima's name? And wail on our marriage.
Her tantrums aren't getting over. Is this the way to talk about my mother? -No, I didn't mean it that way.
-What you meant is obvious by what you said. Faiq, mom's disagreement hurts
me because I want to prove myself. I want to serve her all the time.
Don't misinterpret my emotions Faiq. Don't worry. Have a little patience. I have a feeling that mom is going to
forgive is in a few days. Okay? Relax. Yeah, I hope so too. Hello, yeah Mama? What? He has been given medicine so that
he keeps sleeping and his pain reduces. I think we all should go now, get up. No, I'm going to stay with
him. I'll take care of him. Okay, be careful, he shouldn't wake up. Aima, let em explain you
about his medicines, come. Zaid, Zaid, wake up, have some breakfast. I was just checking your fever, so... I have told you so many
times to stay away from me. How can I leave you in this condition? Dad has given me the
responsibility to take care of you. I don't need anyone. Whatever happened, what's going to happen
in future, I'm responsible for that myself. Stop being so stubborn. 
Till when is this going to go on? You have been like this since a week. You should keep in mind that you aren't
just hurting yourself but all of us as well. I haven't hurt anyone, Aima, nor
anybody needs to worry about me. How can we not worry about you? You are very important for us. Do you have any idea in what
condition dad brought you home? We all got so worried after
knowing about your accident. What if anything happened to you, Zaid? It would have been better, 
your lives would have been easier. -Zaid!
-Please, I don't want to hear anything. Leave me alone. And no need to worry about me, I
don't want anyone to worry about me. Please leave. Okay, just have this glass of milk, I'll
give you your medicines then and leave. Please. Look what you have
done to my garden. Go water the plants there too,
all of them are getting dried up. Don't know what...
Wait a minute, you are back again? Wasn't it enough for you
to get humiliated once? Auntie, please let me meet Zoya. What kind of a shameless girl are you? Auntie, she is my friend, I have to... She used to be your friend, now you have
become the second wife of her husband. Try to understand this difference. And who do you want to prove yourself
nice by visiting here again and again? You are newly married, go and have fun. Roam around with your husband. Now that you have ruined my daughter's life. What the hell do you want? If you have so much love for Zoya,
why don't you get divorced from Zaid? What's wrong? Out of words, are you? You can't do it, do you? Why do you want to meet Zoya then? Auntie, please, I can't
share that with you. Can I go meet Zoya? Go ahead, meet her. Give it 
a try for sake of your satisfaction. But listen to me carefully
that I will do what I have to do. Understand? Now go. Anyway, I came to know that Zaid
met an accident? How is he doing now? What can I say, mom? He is in a bad shape since few days. Few days? But he had
an accident just today. I will not use any of my rights 
even after being Zaid's wife. I promise you that. Please, just let me... let me live in your house. You are serving Zaid 
with a lot of devotion. Yeah, he wasn't able to do his
tasks so I was just taking care of him. You weren't here as well. And you thought of making
the most of the opportunity, right? I'm showing you these pictures so
that you think about our honeymoon. Otherwise why would I show you 
someone else's pictures? Okay, we will go but
it's not the right time.
