From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned to chirp from you I had informed Faiq,
if he comes I'll go with him. Otherwise, I'll go myself. Why will you go alone? Go with Faiq. And if he gets stuck in dome
work then I'll go with you. Forget it, auntie,
I know what is he busy with. Since when you are
tolerating his blackmailing? And why didn't you tell me before? Actually, I got scared that if I tell something to
someone, things might get worse. -You're mad.
-I just got scared. Doesn't matter if anyone
knows about it or not, I'm going to tell everyone that all this
is a drama and I'm not going to be a mom. What did you get me into, Mom? Actually, after telling all this at least
I am going to take the burden off me. Why were you doing it? What is wrong?
What is it, just listen to me. -Shall I tell you something?
-Sure. -Faiq called.
-Really? He was saying that we
shall go for dinner today as it's been such a long
time that we didn't go. Wow, that's great. Auntie. I think Faiq is getting
on track through your schooling. Otherwise he wouldn't have changed. Nosheen, you're too much. I am telling the truth, auntie.
Otherwise, Faiq doesn't listen so easily. Okay, fine. Go now and choose what
dress you are going to wear tonight. It's too soon to get ready. And not
just me, you are coming with us too. No, I am not in the mood to go at all. You both just go and
enjoy with each other. Who has asked you if you are in the mood or not? I am telling you that you are coming
with us, so go and choose your dress too. Nosheen, don't be stubborn, 
try to understand. You are being stubborn which is of no use. And listen, you know, me and Faiq
are going for shopping too in the evening. Really did Faiq say this to you? Yes, Auntie. You know he
was talking to me so nicely that I couldn't believe it's Faiq. Great. May God keeps
you both happy just like this. Yeah I should thank God too,
otherwise my own evil eye might jinx it. Okay, auntie, shall I go rest for a while? Sure, rest for a while and then get ready. Faiq, what's wrong? Nothing. Didn't you have an important meeting
today? Why didn't you go to office? You had a meeting at 11:00 am. Yeah, it slipped my mind. What is it? I have noticed since
many days, you seem disturbed. No, it's nothing like that. Anyway, tell me, you came to
ask me something yesterday. Yeah, I came to you to
check how you are doing. Okay. -Don't I seem disturbed to you now?
-You still do. aren't you going to ask me the reason? I will definitely listen if
you would like to tell. Maybe I can help you. you can't do anything. Nobody can do anything. Why are you saying such depressing things? There is a solution to everything, Zaid. No, Aima, at times
some things have no solution. And even if they do then a person
become really helpless at times. I know that very well. We all have built a lot
of pressure on you, right? It's not like that. And then, I have become
your compulsion too. Aima, I have taken your responsibility. You are not my compulsion. So, am I just a responsibility for you? A person desires to
achieve a lot in his life, but it isn't necessary
that he gets every thing. Anyway, don't worry. Zoya's
matter is going to be resolved soon. Do you love Zoya that much? What difference does that make now? Anyways, I'm heading towards
office, do you want to come? Okay. Zaid, you, may... I wanted to talk to you about something. What is it? I, I want that... you give me a divorce. What happened, Shabana? Isn't sister home? Has she gone somewhere? Her friend called. She was saying that sister
isn't answering her phone. I thought of telling her myself. Yeah, she has gone out
somewhere for shopping. Oh, okay. -Are you worried about something?
-Nothing. I know what you are worried about. I'm worried about the same thing. What are you referring to, Shabana? I am talking about children, our children. Aima, Zaid and Zoya. Brother, I think they aren't happy. I think that we have tied them in this
relationship by force. Anyway, it isn't that easy either. keeping relations intact, and that too in such conditions. Brother, don't you think that they are
going through a huge trial? Yes, you are right, and we
have put them in this trial. How can a person know that the decisions
he is taking will prove to be wrong. If one gets to know then no one would
let their children go through this pain. -Yes.
-Did Aima say something to you? No, she doesn't say anything, but I can figure out everything
just by looking at her, what is going on inside her. Yeah, I have an idea too. May I come in? Hammad, dear! -Greetings, auntie.
-Greetings, I am so happy to see you. Didn't you miss us since so long? Missed you all a lot, that's why I'm back. -How are you doing, Dad?
-I'm good, come sit. Please sit, I'll go meet others. All right. Hello, greetings, mama. Yeah, I'm at home. Really? That's great news. Yeah, I'll visit you in the evening. How can I come right now?
Even Faiq isn't home right now. Okay, fine, let me see. Bye. Faiq, -You know what?
-What? Mama just called. She was telling
me that Hammad has returned home. That's nice. Faiq, aren't you excited at all? You are getting over excited, you brother
is back. What do I have to do with him? Can't you be happy for me? What nonsense, Nosheen? Of course, I'm the one
saying all the nonsense. Look, now don't you start with that. 
I am already too tired. If Sania had messaged you right now
then you wouldn't have been tired. Oh, shut up, Nosheen,
what are you saying? I'm saying the truth. You aren't even happy about our
kid, you have to do with him at least. Nosheen, I think it's been so
many days that we didn't have a fight, may be that's why you aren't at ease.
What do you want? Obviously, I am the one starting
all the fights, you are so innocent. If this is what you plan
to do then I shall leave. No, you stay here, sit here, I'm leaving. Nosheen! He just got back from work. May be
he is actually upset about something. That's nothing new, he is upset
about one thing or the other all the time. Okay, fine, you don't lose heart. I think Faiq is taking revenge from me. -Revenge? What for?
-For getting married to me. I don't understand what's 
the use of arguing about the past? I was so happy, I thought that
we will go to mom's to meet him. Okay, then, he will go with you. With this mood, even I am not going there. Let him rest for a while. Come on, get up. Go get his clothes ready
and get ready yourself too. I'll make tea. I'm not going, auntie.
I don't feel like talking to him. Oh come on, you have started it again. Didn't I just explain you? Auntie, I think Faiq is sad
about not getting married to Aima. Nosheen, that is history now.
Just forget it. What difference does it make if I
forget it or not, Faiq remembers it. And he regrets it a lot. I don't think so, 
but maybe that's the case. That is the case, auntie. Aima has cursed us so
that we don't stay happy. No, Nosheen, Aim can never curse anyone. -Really? How can you say that?
-My heart tells me that. And, she had forgiven us all that day, and said that whatever has
happened is my fate only. It might be that she said
something but she didn't meant it. No, Nosheen, I know Aima very well, she can never lie. I have filed a case on you, Zoya, that you are threatening
me to kill my unborn child. You are harassing me. You'll get a legal notice
from my lawyer tomorrow. Stop blaming yourself. Besides, if you are going to lose
hope who is going to take care of Aima? I know. That's why I will have to marry Aima. I don't know anything, you just
can't leave now, I'm telling you. Mama, you shall tie his
feet so that he can't go now. Hey, no need to be so cruel. You guys said it, that's enough for me. Okay then, let's cancel this plan. Thank you so much for taking my side. By the way, you didn't
come to my wedding, so now you will have to
buy me a very nice gift. That's not a problem, just
name it and I will get it for you. Mama, where is Zaid? He has gone to office, I've called
him, he must be coming any moment. okay, and Aima? 
Isn't she back yet either? She'll be here soon too.
You're here for now, right? Yes, Dad, I'll go after having dinner. So, aren't you going to... He isn't going anywhere from
here, and I won't let him go either. I'll pack my stuff in a couple
of days and move here then. -Promise?
-Yes, Mom, promise. Faiq was here with you too,
where did he go? Yes, Dad, he is talking
to someone outside. Excuse me? He's talking? Address him respectfully,
he is your husband. Oh, please! He is right, you should
address him with respect. All this is because of you. See,
now I am getting schooled now. Tell me one thing, how much trouble
have you caused to your mother in law? It's nothing like that. Ask dad, I have
a great friendship with my mother in law. Yeah right, this is how it is
in the beginning, right Mama? Yes, of course, right? But tell me, Mama... -Greetings.
-Greetings. -How are you doing?
-I'm good. How are you? I'm not good. What happened? All good? No. You seem quite worried. Aima, you haven't forgiven me, right? It's not like that. It is like that. I know that you haven't forgiven me. How can you say that? Because I am unhappy. I am unhappy even after trying so hard. I had never loved Nosheen. Don't know why I listened to her that day? I didn't understand what
has happened with me. It takes two to tango, Faiq. If you hadn't loved Nosheen, you wouldn't have done all
that what you did that night. Aima, please believe me I... I don't need any of your justifications. And I do not regret at all of
not getting married to you. -Aima...
-I'm not done yet. If you think that you are unhappy
because I haven't forgiven you then I forgive you sincerely. Thank you. But I have one request. -What?
-Nosheen is a kid, she is very innocent. Whatever she had done
was just a childish act by her. But I want you to forget all that. 
She is your wife now. So, to meet you now we
will have to wait for so long? No, it's not like that. I went to the
office and then I was in my room. And you didn't come to meet me? Actually, I didn't know that you are here. Okay, fine, I forgive you. Thanks a lot. Aima, look here, towards me. What is it? -You tell me that.
-What do you mean? Means, why aren't you happy? No, it's nothing like that. Oh, really? Aima, you know that we have
been raised together since childhood. And I always figure out by looking at
your face if there is something wrong. There is nothing as such. Well, I must be have wrong vibes then. Forget me, you tell me how
you are doing, and your wife... You still know how to change
the topic like you used to. Anyway, I'm good. Me and my wife aren't together
anymore, we are separated. Sorry about that. Actually, I'm happy. Well, good for you then. Aima, actually I believe that if you don't get happiness through 
a relationship, then you should end it. And at times one has to break the
relationships for others' happiness too. Aima, shall I ask you one thing? Yes? -Are you and Zaid...
-We both are parting our ways. I am taking divorce from Zaid. Zaid and Zoya love each other a lot. I was just forced into their lives. -Aima.
-Yes? May I ask you something? Sure. Do you still love Zaid? Aima, you haven't
forgiven me yet, have you? There is nothing as such. It is like that. I know that you haven't forgiven me. How can you say that? Because I am unhappy. I am unhappy even after trying so hard. I have never loved Nosheen. What's wrong, Faiq? -Nothing.
-You didn't sleep. You go, I'll be there in a while. Faiq, come, breakfast is ready. Faiq! Hello, Faiq. Where are you? What? You went to office? Okay. All right. Who are you? This is my husband's number. What? How? How is he doing now? Nosheen, who was it on the phone? -Aren't you angry with me, Aima?
-Why would I be angry with you, Nosheen? You know, I have always
deliberately given trouble to you. I have always teased you deliberately. I have decided to divorce Aima. Why are you leaving her, Zaid? Just because I don't like her? Or because I am going to
be the mother of your child? If that's the case then I have lied to you. I'm not expecting.
