[307.52] three went there all three slept and
[312.00] Aama oh ok Zoya also went ok anyway
[317.40] after so many exams everyone must be tired they need to
[319.32] relax a bit they are right
[321.76] bhaijaan and now only a few days are left their
[324.40] studies will also be completed why brother if they
[326.84] want to study further they can study
[330.00] Zaid doesn't seem to have any plans of studying further
[331.80] I will only talk about Zaid  I am here
[334.04] then you tell me Shawana what
[337.84] is the plan for Aima, what kind of plan is it Bhaijaan,
[341.04] plan means what has she
[343.16] thought about her father's studies, her career,
[345.12] what is her plan for the future,
[347.04] brother, the plan should be simple, a girl
[349.48] goes, learns the ways of the house and then gets married, well
[352.60] you don't interfere, what is a boy or a girl,
[354.60] Aima is intelligent, we cannot waste her knowledge,
[357.08] we are intelligent, then we will
[361.04] keep her at home all her life, brother, Bhabhi is right, you have already
[365.40] spent a lot on Aima's
[367.16] education, Aima is my daughter, I have not done any favour
[369.52] to her, she can study as much as she wants
[371.88] and beware if someone
[374.08] forces her to take a wrong decision, I
[377.36] understand Bhaijaan,
[379.92] this is your greatness, but who takes
[384.08] care of us so much, you took care of us after Aima's father's death,
[392.00] if you were not there, who
[394.96] knows how we mother and daughter would have lived, Valla

[419.76] How many boring songs do you both listen to,
[422.88] brother, the cold has started  Now if you both can have your way then
[430.60] keep listening to these cheap crying songs
[435.28] oh this is a
[437.52] song it is not that you just keep crying he enjoys so
[440.48] one of his actions one
[444.80] habit does not match with us I don't know why
[446.36] we tolerate it
[449.96] see this is the thing I mean I am so
[453.52] good that anyone wants to be friends with me
[456.32] I take the credit for it by the
[461.20] way you know today I was not in the mood to
[464.88] go at all it was you both so I am coming
[468.64] Zoya we also go to many such places
[472.36] where only you enjoy right
[474.88] Zaid and bhai there is a concert at night and we miss it I
[478.32] mean it is pain pain yes so
[484.08] when did I say that I did not like Rahat sahab
[486.16] really like him
[489.16] but sometimes his songs make me
[493.48] cry
[498.48] okay okay no problem this time we will
[501.56] request him that Zoya Zoya wants
[504.44] sir ji to make
[508.12] Michael Jackson do it in Raag Darbari what does she
[510.20] say what is the matter what is the matter who should talk oh ok okay
[513.20] you want him to
[516.24] remove us from the concert please sit quietly
[520.12] behind ya Zara not yet  I came and wait outside her house,
[525.80] you were there, right? It was you, right?
[528.76] Why did she offer me? She's my friend, she's a very
[531.92] good friend. The girl must be coming. She's come, she's
[575.56] come. Hi, sorry guys, sorry guys, I'm late. Hello, hi, hi, no, no, sit down [Music] Sit down. Hello, yes, Faisal, you've come, okay, I'm just coming. Bye [Music] Hello, yes, Fari, I'm going for dinner with Faisal. Uncle's call is coming, so take care of it.
[578.48] Please, I can't do so much for my friend.
[581.32] Well, take care of it this time. Next time, I
[583.28] won't take your name. Bye Nasheen,
[588.08] son, are you going somewhere? Why did
[592.00] you have any work? No, son, there was no work,
[594.32] but if you're going out, then
[599.64] what's the problem with these clothes? There's nothing
[601.44] wrong with these clothes, but Bhaijaan
[604.84] might object. He does
[608.96] n't like girls wearing such clothes.
[610.80] Your Bhaijaan is my dad and I have
[614.16] my uncle to take care of my dad. Now,
[617.24] why don't you take care of your daughter, Aamaa, she's
[619.44] after me all the time. You've ruined
[622.00] my whole mood, nothing can ruin
[624.20] your mood
[626.31] [Music]
[638.92] How many times have you  I haven't visited for days
[640.96] You are so busy, I know, but
[644.64] what can I do I don't get time You
[647.72] know that after Riyaz's death
[649.88] I have to look after the entire business It is very difficult
[654.12] and I understand time management, yes, I
[656.56] know you have become a big businesswoman,
[658.92] but this doesn't mean that a
[660.96] person should leave his relationships,
[662.68] ok baba, sorry I will come, I will come soon,
[667.68] tell me how is everyone at home, how is Azmat bhai,
[670.28] Azmat is also busy like you
[672.76] and the children have their own life, no
[675.76] one has time for me, why, there is
[679.44] your sister-in-law, I talk to her, it is
[683.40] enough to make my blood boil, baaji, let me give you some advice,
[686.84] keep Zaid away from this girl, I do
[691.12] n't like her intentions, I can guess,
[695.28] I always say that mothers and
[699.00] daughters are not what they appear to be,
[702.76] despite knowing everything I am helpless,
[705.00] you know Azmat does
[707.40] n't value my words and as for Zaid, he also only does
[710.96] his own thing,
[712.60] you don't make Jaya understand and don't give this girl
[716.12] too much free time  Okay, I will try to
[719.88] explain but when does she understand?
[723.36] Now let's see how many good
[725.96] proposals have come but she is a girl and does
[728.20] n't listen to them. Are you
[731.24] thinking of her marriage? If there is a good
[734.84] option, I will think about it. Right now she is
[737.72] studying, why should I worry about her so soon? I am
[739.92] not worried but I am a
[743.24] single mother so I can't delay it much.
[748.16] But this will be done when my
[751.60] daughter likes someone. That girl does
[754.40] n't like anyone. The
[756.80] matter will reach the stage of marriage only when
[760.28] she selects someone.
[762.96] Okay, I will talk to
[767.68] you later, rather I will just take a round. I have some
[770.60] work, let me take care of that.
[774.48] Allah Hafiz Allah Hafiz
[778.38] [Music]
[781.76] Why did I get so
[785.52] angry? No one
[790.28] knows. By the way,
[792.20] Zoya or Faraz were talking to you a lot.
[796.00] Mast Magan. Is there any scene going on between you
[797.76] two and Faraz? By the way,
[803.68] what do you think friend? Looking at the pictures,
[806.40] I feel that
[809.44] you both make a great pair. Why did you see, how was she dancing?
[811.76] Yes it's not that bad Riley
[817.60] then I will do one thing I will get you to
[819.96] talk to him what do you think what do you
[822.96] think he
[826.16] likes you right yes
[831.16] every boy in the university likes me
[833.56] but I can't marry everyone
[835.72] right if you say so then I will get you to
[838.68] talk to him have you gone mad
[843.24] yes my father and
[846.72] mother will find a boy for me wow this is a family man
[852.48] decent innocent
[855.52] sweet this is a beautiful girl learn
[858.48] something from her yes our Aima is very decent and beautiful
[862.12] but I don't want to become like this
[865.20] I am fine the way I am as it is my wish brother
[868.64] people do make friends with girls like you
[871.20] but for marriage they like people like Aima
[876.64] yes this is what I want if it were in my power then
[880.44] instead of my marriage I would get Aima married wait
[885.56] a
[889.20] minute I would get her married to the same guy as well yes it is
[892.20] obvious
[895.44] what nonsense you both have started talking
[902.76] sorry
[905.28] Amma on this matter uncle this Zoya's work
[911.18] [Praise]
[913.99] [Music]
[915.75] [Praise]
[919.47] [Music] was
[922.60] today  You were late in coming. He had gone to
[927.04] meet Rashid sahab.
[930.24] What's the matter? The kids haven't come yet. Yes,
[933.80] I called Zaid. They were at Amber's house. They must be coming.
[937.96] Where is Nausheen? She has gone to sleep. No, she has
[942.08] actually gone with her friends.
[946.80] Yes, she has gone for dinner. She must be coming. What
[950.64] time is it to go for dinner? I do
[953.40] n't like her going out like this.
[955.56] Why are you getting upset over small things? I am
[957.40] telling you that she will come.
[959.88] You have given her a lot of freedom.
[963.44] I am not a fan of so much freedom. Did you understand that
[973.12] Asif's Fansi is so beautiful?
[977.28] No, seriously. What did you like about her?
[982.28] What's the point in looks? A person should have a
[986.24] good heart. Yes, all these things are said and
[990.00] sound good but the
[993.36] fact is that nowadays looks matter. No matter how
[996.32] good a person's heart is, it doesn't
[999.24] matter. No, Saya. Now see
[1002.80] how good understanding Asif has with his Fansi.
[1004.44] And I also like the couple of both of them.
[1009.64] Yes, yes, I agree. The most important thing for
[1013.36] me is a person.  There is intellectual
[1015.04] compatibility what is the use of beauty it
[1018.28] is not there today I don't understand the talks between you two I will
[1024.12] never marry an older boy no matter
[1026.28] how good hearted he is
[1029.76] okay brother you can marry a hero
[1032.28] anyway you do so much modeling to trap
[1034.44] Zaid it is such a bad thing for kind
[1038.36] formation I don't trap people people
[1042.04] trap me ok brother now your fight between you two is
[1045.04] over so Zaid let's go

[1113.84] phone, what time have you come at

[1119.88] because of you kids,
[1121.52] your dad scolds me a lot, yesterday also he was
[1123.80] scolding me so much, all the issues are
[1127.28] with me only, he does not say anything to Aima and Zaid,
[1129.56] whenever I see you, Aima and Zaid keep roaming around,
[1132.44] now Zaid bhai is a cousin, not a real brother, I have
[1135.84] also told him the same thing, but he does
[1137.68] not find a single bad thing in Aima,
[1142.40] I am the real daughter of uncle and whenever I see him, he keeps singing the praises of Aima
[1145.16] and you please explain to papa also,
[1148.20] what should I explain, that he should not interfere in my matters,
[1150.84] why, when I was
[1153.16] going yesterday, I was saying, don't
[1155.68] wear such clothes, he has nothing to do with your clothes,
[1157.92] uncle, I also said the same thing,
[1161.92] my uncle is there for me, you should take care of your daughter
[1164.40] Aima, did you
[1166.32] understand, nothing, you get
[1171.36] ready for breakfast quickly, then daddy

[1202.96] Perfect good can I ask you one thing
[1209.64] Mom why do you and Zaid take Ama with you everywhere
[1215.04] [Music] what kind of
[1216.24] question is this it's a
[1220.28] simple question why don't
[1223.56] you both go alone
[1226.44] why do you take her with you everywhere Mom if
[1229.24] she is with me then what is wrong in it
[1231.96] she is
[1234.64] my friend son you are a very simple girl I do
[1239.00] n't know why I feel that you will suffer a
[1241.80] great loss because of her Mom
[1245.80] she is very simple you are
[1249.24] completely misunderstanding her you know
[1251.60] how much she helps people
[1253.76] I told you that you are very simple
[1258.28] because you don't
[1261.04] know these tricks now see how she controlled both the men there while staying in Baji's house
[1272.20] Mom please don't talk to me like this are
[1277.68] you okay don't believe me one day you will see this
[1283.64] girl  She will teach everyone a very good lesson, I
[1292.68] buttered her up,
[1296.16] why did I not
[1300.92] like this, nobody
[1305.05] [Sangeet] I don't know if
[1311.76] you had any conversation with Nausheen yesterday
[1317.38] [Sangeet]
[1318.80] No, there was no special conversation,
[1322.84] yes, I told her that brother does
[1326.76] n't like these clothes, so it is possible that she might have
[1329.60] felt bad about what I said and that is why you immediately
[1333.00] filled your brother's ears with it.
[1337.72] No, no
[1340.80] Bhabhi, I haven't spoken to brother about this, I have
[1343.84] only spoken to Nasheen,
[1346.52] I know
[1348.76] what you talk about with your brother, when. No, no
[1353.00] Bhabhi, believe me, I have
[1357.36] n't spoken to brother about this, I
[1359.80] only told Nasheen that brother does
[1363.16] n't like these kinds of clothes on girls, so now
[1367.24] you will tell him what his dad likes,
[1371.08] nowadays all girls wear such clothes
[1374.80] and most of all I know
[1379.04] what your daughter is wearing and where she is going. Bhabhi, you are
[1381.88] right, but I had no motive behind this.
[1387.24] Nasheen is my own child, daughter, that's why
[1392.04] I was explaining to her, Aima, she is your daughter,
[1395.28] you
[1399.48] keep an eye on her, no one becomes decent by wearing decent clothes.
[1405.08] Shabana what do you mean bhabhi
[1408.96] brother people don't look at girls who come home late at night with a
[1412.08] good eye
[1415.64] otherwise you are quite intelligent
[1421.30] [Music]
[1425.96] Bhabhi I made a mistake I wo
[1429.16] n't say anything to Nashin in future yes brother
[1433.64] this is better for you because
[1435.76] I am still alive for her alright
[1440.29] [Music] I am not
[1461.92] scared of seeing dreams but of their getting shattered I
[1466.44] talk to you and meet you every day
[1471.68] but still I don't
[1474.32] know who is in your heart
[1477.68] sometimes I feel that it is me
[1482.44] but then I think whether I am being
[1486.84] misunderstood
[1488.84] and I compose myself
[1491.80] but it is also true
[1494.56] that I dream of you and only you
[1500.16] since childhood I have loved only you
[1504.56] Zaid but I have never expressed this to
[1509.60] anyone else except myself and neither will I ever
[1513.88] do so if Allah has written you in my fate then
[1516.72] I will consider myself lucky
[1525.16] but if it doesn't happen then
[1529.24] [Music]
[1542.64] Mother
[1545.65] [Music]
[1548.40] what was mother doing
[1551.88] I don't know anything just like that I
[1556.48] talk about the whole day at night until you do
[1558.76] n't share your thoughts with her you don't feel at peace
[1561.85] [Music]  I get it
[1564.20] when you know then why are you asking,
[1569.08] Amma, are you taking the medicines on time,
[1573.28] right? Yes, son
[1576.72] I am taking them because this time your reports have
[1579.48] not come out well,
[1580.80] your sugar is very high, you know I don't know
[1589.04] when I will get rid of the medicines, it will
[1592.16] never be free because the doctors
[1595.68] say that you may forget to eat
[1598.72] but you cannot forget to take medicines,
[1602.36] well leaving my health aside, he
[1610.32] said one thing, Amma, what's the matter, the
[1616.36] issue is that the girls who do
[1620.48] n't have the protection of their father have to take
[1624.24] every step very cautiously,
[1627.88] Amma, you have told me this a thousand times before,
[1634.32] son, by repeating it again and again, things are remembered, I
[1639.12] want
[1641.80] you not to take any such step
[1645.12] which raises questions on my upbringing, has
[1650.24] Mehmani said anything to you? No, no
[1652.84] one has said anything to me, so
[1657.48] I was just telling you,
[1661.52] son, don't go to the party in the evening with Zoya and Jahad,
[1667.84] Amma Jaan, I went after asking you, I
[1671.60] went with your permission, and wherever I go, I go after
[1675.20] asking you, yes  Son, when you
[1679.12] asked, I did not refuse because I would
[1682.28] spoil your mood, but son, be careful
[1684.96] from now on. Yes, mother
[1689.14] [Music]
[1713.19] [Music]
[1721.47] [Music]
[1729.84] what are you
[1731.16] doing, are you playing a game? No, no, dad, I was just free for
[1735.12] a little while, so you know just how
[1737.64] free you are, then you should come to the factory.
[1740.52] No, dad, you are not even that free now. There are
[1743.80] just two days' examination leave, so I was
[1746.48] just passing some time. So, what did
[1750.16] you think after the paper? Right now, I have not
[1765.12] thought of anything. If you have not thought of anything, then think about it. I want you to join my factory. Anyway, I have become very lonely, dad. Please, keep me away from these things for a few days. You know
[1767.24] what we have done to you, still
[1769.48] you are saying this. I
[1773.00] hope you will disrespect me. Don't worry dad, I won't
[1776.88] deprive you. I will
[1780.72] join the factory soon. Son,
[1783.00] such a non-serious attitude in life ruins a
[1784.84] person. Be a little serious.
[1793.36] [Music]
[1825.00] Hello, I am Zoya, I am talking. Yes, yes,
[1832.72] I am coming.  I
[1837.44] will go, how far do I have to go?
[1841.24] Okay, thank you so
[1847.56] much, what happens, mom. Guess
[1853.84] your result must have come out. I had given
[1858.64] my portfolio to various places, so I got a
[1861.24] call from there. They
[1864.36] selected me and I have my audition tomorrow.
[1870.32] So son, I don't
[1872.84] like your hobby of modelling at all.
[1874.64] Mom, we have already discussed this before
[1877.56] and you know it is my passion
[1881.12] and you will see that I will earn so much fame, so much
[1885.00] fame and along with that,
[1888.16] what is the need to earn money? Your dad who
[1891.08] left behind so much, it's all yours,
[1893.44] mom. That money is not mine, it belongs to dad and
[1897.08] I am talking about my money. First of all, I don't
[1899.88] understand what you are saying. No
[1904.00] problem,
[1906.16] mom, you don't even need to understand. Okay,
[1909.68] you ask Bheenu baba to make coffee, please
[1914.10] [music]
[1918.88] Love
[1925.20] you, yes, I will definitely tell you,
[1929.48] okay, Allah
[1933.64] Hafiz, what's the matter? Shawana looks very happy.
[1936.32] Whose call was it brother? It's good that you
[1940.32] came to me here. It's a happy thing. It was a call from Ima Keep.
[1948.64] Actually, he was calling his elder son.  She is
[1953.72] asking for Aama's hand for Fai. Actually she
[1957.44] likes Aama a lot and now wants to make her her daughter-in-law.
[1963.08] Our Aima is so
[1967.76] nice that everyone would want to make her the daughter-in-law of their house.
[1970.88] Alhamdulillah
[1975.84] ji Bhaijaan. That is why I told her
[1979.40] that I should first consult with brother and then I will
[1982.64] tell him. That is fine. But
[1984.76] Shivana, for now, refuse him by giving some suitable excuse.
[1988.74] [Music] No
[2001.36] one
[2006.24] knows why you became unwanted. We don't have any brother
[2009.28] on whose assistance we can sit at home.
[2014.16] Aha Shawana is lucky in this matter.
[2017.56] Your Faf was
[2023.08] talking about your relationship with Fai, so what did you
[2026.96] say? What did I have to say? I was happy,
[2032.68] hang up the
[2035.48] phone, ok, bye.
