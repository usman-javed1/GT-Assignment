From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned to chirp from you That's the reason we
had to postpone our flight. No problem, dear. It's good
as much as you both can enjoy together. Aima, are you happy dear? Yes, a lot. Zoya, Zaid's flight must have landed. What time was his flight? It must have landed at 7 o'clock. but it's 10:30 now. He should have come by now to pick you up. -Listen, Nosheen.
-What now? Actually? can you lend me some money? What happened,Mom? Isn't he picking up? His phone is switched off. Don't worry, there is
still time in your flight. Hello. Yeah, Zaid? Okay. What is it? What was Zaid saying? Zaid isn't coming. His flight got canceled. And who will tell us that you are telling
the truth? Because I don't trust you at all. Here, I have her umber in my phone. Just dial
it and ask her whom I was with today. Dial it. Faiq, whenever a person talks
in anger, he says wrong things. We will sit calmly and talk in detail. Who is calling you this late? Actually, Faiq, it's mama. Is this the time to call? Faiq, she is my mama. She worries
about me that's why she is calling. I know that she is your
mother, but she must know that she is not supposed to call her daughter
at her in laws at this hour. This isn't the way. Faiq, she is my mother.
At least show some respect. I should be the one to show respect,
and nothing implies on you guys? What do you mean by you guys? She is my mother,
why are you dragging her into this? Why shouldn't I drag her? She supports you in your every wrong deed. Wrong deed? What have I done that you are
accusing my mother  too along with me? Nosheen, I am not in a mood
to argue with you at this hour. You are not in a mood to argue,
but you can accuse me? I thought of you as a simple
and naive person. But you have proved yourself
to be completely opposite. So now you know how I am. Now just stop this nonsense,
and I'm going to bed. You are talking nonsense yourself
and the taunting me? And your mother feels proud
on this upbringing of hers. Don't you dare say a word
against my mother, understood? Really, not a single word
against your mother, and what about the things you
are saying against my mother? Nosheen, just shut your mouth, or else... Or else? Or else I am going to drop you off
to your mother's, got it? Zaid, I know you must be
very worried right now. I tried my best to get another flight. But due to bad weather we
are unable to get any other flight. Your trip has been canceled twice. May be there is God's wisdom behind it. You'll see, whenever you guys are going to go
this time, you will have a great experience. I'm sorry, Zaid. Had I known that this visit
is going to prolong this much, you and Zoya will have so much issues, then I would have come
with the office team. Why are you saying sorry?
It's not your fault in all this. In fact, it's no one is fault. But who can explain this to Zoya now? Both the reasons are genuine. If you will explain
her calmly, she will understand it for sure. It's not that easy, Aima. I'm sure she is going to
raise a big issue on this too. Zaid, why are you
assuming all this yourself? She isn't that stupid. No, Aima, you have no idea.
She has been very stubborn lately. She considers my every justification
just as an excuse. She doesn't understand anything I say. Look, what's done is done. I am sure that if you try to explain her
calmly, she is going to understand it for sure. She is Zoya, not you who cooperates
with me on everything. I know how to appease her. Just put yourself in her place. Her plan has been canceled twice.
She ought to get angry then. She must have so many desires,
to travel with you. She must have had so many plans. She is going through a difficult time. -I just don't want to talk to her.
-Zaid, please. Please, just solve this issue now. Why do I have to appease her every time. It's been so many days did
she message me even once? You both are alike, stubborn. You both don't agree to anything easily. Even after I have told you so many
times, you haven't called her either. Look, now when we'll go back,
just end the tension between you two. Don't prolong it. Okay? Mom, I wanted to tell you
that I have got an offer. They were asking me from some
time, so I'm going on their shoot. Very good, you have done a great thing. I'm thinking to start work properly. I'm very happy for you. Very good decision. When will you be back? I have no idea. I might get a little late. -But I'll inform you.
-It's okay. -Okay, Mom, I'll get going now.
-Listen, just don't worry. What for? I will get your flight rescheduled. There is no need for that.
Just cancel this trip, please. Zoya, Zaid has no fault in
whatever happened this time. -It was just due to bad weather...
-I told you, Mom. There is no need for that. Besides,
our money doesn't grow on trees. You earn it with a lot of hard work. Don't worry, dear. I can spend as much money as
required for my daughter’s happiness. I know, that's why I am
saying it because I want it. I don't want to go anywhere. Just get this trip canceled. First tell me, why did you
come without telling me? So now you are going
to accuse me when it's your fault. First you tell me, where did you go without
telling your husband and mother in law. That's not your problem. Oh, so it's your problem. Okay then
solve it yourself. Why did you call me? The problem wasn't with me going out. The issue was created when you
came without informing, understand? May God never give anyone a daughter like
you. I just came to give you a surprise. -And you are...
-To hell with your lame surprise. -What is wrong with you, Nosheen?
-I have lost my mind. My life wasn't that beautiful as is, and it has turned even more
difficult because of your stupidity. Not because of my stupidity, Nosheen. You are ruining your life because of
your own deeds, just remember that. Enough now, I don't want
to hear your advice. This is all is the result
of not listening to my advice, Nosheen. Just stop your nonsense. You got me
caught and then you are scolding me too. Rather than accepting your
mistake, you are cursing me. I handled things with so
much difficulty the other day. You know how embarrassed I got in
front of your mother law and your husband? What difference did it make
even after you handled thing? And that crazy man,
it's not like he spared me. And that old woman,
she is such a drama queen. She was pretending in front
of Faiq talk to to me politely. Talk slowly, someone might hear.
Are you completely out of your mind? If your mother in law hears it,
a new drama is going to start. To hell with that old woman.
Such a drama queen. Oh, God, give this girl some sense. Nosheen, please, control yourself and your behavior
or else there is going to be a huge problem. There is a problem already.
What else can be that bad? Nosheen, please,
this can create a huge problem. So please try to understand. He has just slapped you right now.
He might kick you out of his home too. -I'm warning you.
-Are you on his side or mine? Nosheen, I'm on your side, that's
why I am trying to explain you. Oh, thank you so much that you took
my side and gave me so much advice. Nosheen, just shut your mouth, and don't
you dare do anything that Faiq dislikes. Okay, anything else? And, Nosheen, listen. Go and
apologize to Faiq. He is your husband. Apology and me? No chance. Do whatever you want, but
listen to one thing carefully, if you get kicked out of that house, your father
is not going to let you enter in this house, Okay, I don't care. Hello? Hello? Oh! This girl is going
to get me a heart failure one day. -So, shoot wrap up?
-Yeah it's a wrap. -Okay.
-Today's shoot was wonderful. -Thank you.
-Let me order some coffee for you. All right. And Boss has called you to his office. -Right now?
-Yeah. Okay, fine, send my coffee there then. Okay, I'll send it. Nosheen. Nosheen, have your lunch. Eat something, you haven't
eaten since last night. If a person is not opening the door,
this means that he doesn't want to talk. But I haven’t come to talk.
I have just brought lunch. I don't want to have lunch.
Just leave me alone. Nosheen I know what you are going through. Really? You must be very happy then. Why do you always
think that I'm your enemy? Because I know very well
whatever you are doing with me. I am not stupid. What do you mean? When have I been unfair to you? If I have taken away any right of yours,
or been cruel to you then let me know. You hate me. You want that Faiq leaves me, and if he
keeps me then he should just confine me. Because you feel good seeing me like that. I don't understand how
can you even think of all this? You can tell that. I think you want
your own blood to come in this house. Nosheen, a marriage is done
once only, not again and again. And you have to fulfill it all your life. This isn't a drama going
on that I am going to conspire and play tricks and plan
to get you out of this house. Wow, you say such nice things. But remember one thing, that Faiq's
behavior with me is just because of you. You poison him against me. I have no answer to your mistrust. I just want to tell you that it gives
me no pleasure when you both fight. Instead it hurts me. And I am not even from those mothers
who get their daughter in laws tortured and make their son's life
miserable and restless. Okay, I'll try to explain Faiq. But please, try that this
doesn't happen again. It would be better that you explain him. Because next time,
I won't stand still after getting hit. I know how to respond as well. It would be better that instead of taking
revenge you get to the root cause of this fight. And try to take responsibility
of your marriage. The day you will start changing you'll see how good your
married life is going to be. Okay, fine, I will try. Okay now have your lunch. -This is my own office, Zoya.
-Yes, I know that. So how did your shoot go? It was good. Besides I always
feel good working with your agency. Actually there is something 
for which I have called you. The client has really liked 
our Dubai shoot. Because of which, I have
discussed it with my team as well, we would like to make a contract with you. -Do you want to same something?
-Yes. Uncle that's why I wanted
to take your permission. I like it, Zoya, that you 
asked for my permission. You are the elder of this house. And had my dad been alive today, then I would have asked 
for his permission too. Sorry, it's nothing, 
I was just listening to you. The thing is that the contract 
will be of two years. And you won't be able to work for
any other agency other than ours. So, do I have to decide it right now? No, don't make a decision right now.
You may discuss it with your family. And then take a decision. And if I want to have the contract
right now, I mean is it ready yet? We have the contract ready with us, we'll
just have to print your name on it. What else. Okay, then just get 
the contract. I'll sign it. Okay, I will get the contract. 
So should I consider it a deal? -Deal done.
-Done. That boor. Nosheen, please listen to me. 
Seriously, Nosheen, I need you. Nosheen, I just need 
a hundred thousand rupees. I promise you I am going to return all your
money. Just help me this time, please help me. I will only give poison to him. I have been calling you both for past one
hour. Why was your phone switched off? Dad, actually for some reason both our phones
stopped working, I think due to moisture. We can't tell you 
how difficult it was for us. Oh, God! Anyway, not an issue. 
Get a new one. By the way, Dad, you didn't
ask us about the meeting. Why should I ask when I already know? -What do you mean?
-What do you mean? Make a guess. Did you get any email? Dad, tell us now. Yes, we have got the contract. -Wow, that's great news.
-Yes, exactly. Thank God. Congrats, Dad. You both already had an idea, don't you? Honestly, Dad, we had an idea but we wanted
that you get to know it from them directly. Wow, how direct. 
You both are too secretive. I mean you didn't let me have 
any idea before. Dad, this was Zaid's idea. He thought it should
be confirmed first then he should tell you. The good thing is that the
reason for which you both went, you came back successful
by the grace of God. You are absolutely right. 
I am really proud of my kids today. To tell you the truth, 
more credit goes to Aima. The way she gave satisfactory
answers to their queries, honestly had it been just me, 
I couldn't have handled it that way. It's nothing like that, 
Zaid has worked as hard as I did. That's nice. It's both your achievement. Brother, just sweets won't do. 
You will have to throw a party. What do you say kids? Why not. That's understood. There is going to be a party,
a very grand party and that too from my side. I think you guys should go rest now. Yes, take rest. I will take care of some chores too. I'll join you too. Okay, Dad, I will leave too. Wait a second, I have to talk to you. Sure, go ahead. Really, thank you very much, dear. Dad, strangers are supposed to be thanked, and I did it for my own company. 
So, please don't embarrass me. No, I'm not talking about that. -Oh, you are...
-You didn't let me down, son. And this means a lot to me. I'm talking about Aima. I can tell by looking 
at the joy on her face that you listened to
me and treated her well. For that I have to say thank you to you. I know that that girl deserves your love. Really love you and thank you, 
and I'm proud of you, dear. -Proud of you.
-Thank you, Dad. Take rest. Thank you. What is this? I didn't ask for any tea. Faiq, I thought you might like it,
that's why I made sandwiches with tea. Nosheen, at least you should
have asked. I don't feel like eating. So what, you can have at least
this much with tea. Please, don't force me. 
I told you I'm not in the mood. You are not in the mood? Can't you
eat it just to make your wife happy? Nosheen, I had a late lunch, 
in fact I had it at 4:00 pm. And then I had coffee. 
So I can't have it right now. So, why did you had your lunch late? 
Any specific reason? Now you will be after it 
that why I had a late lunch. Faiq, I'm your wife. I must know about what you are
eating at what time and with whom. Oh, so you want to know 
who I had my lunch with. Obviously, I should be aware. One can not trust husbands these days. Don't know who they roam
around with when they go out. We can't get a tracker installed in them. One can't even trust 
the wives these days either. Then should all the husbands
should install tracker in them too? Why are you prolonging it so much? Right now I am doing something
very important, so go from here, please. And take all this away too. Zafar, what are you doing? Why don't you tell the gardener to work
properly? Look at the plants and the grass. And why aren't the lights 
still not repaired? Neither the fountain is repaired. Call the electrician 
I'll talk to him myself. Are you happy now? You can go, Zafar. What's wrong, dear? I went to give sandwiches to
your son because you asked me to. Didn't he eat them? He didn't even eat them 
and insulted me as well. Really? I don't think what your son
thinks of himself. It's like as if he has got a license
to insult me because I married him. No, Nosheen, he isn't like that. Just leave it, auntie. He is your
son, you will think good of him. Everyone likes their children. He is angry right now, 
that's why he is doing all this. What is it that I have done that his anger isn't ending? Then go and try to appease him. This way the bitterness
between you two will end. Auntie, I have never tolerated
such tantrums even by my father. Dear, a father doesn't show tantrums,
in fact he bears his daughter's tantrums. And there is a lot of difference
between a father and a husband. Daughters are their father's darlings. But you have to work really hard 
to win your husband's heart. Just leave it, now don't
you start lecturing me. My tantrums were never
borne by my father, and neither my husband does
it even after getting married. I don't know who are such clever girls who control their father and brother, and after getting married
they control their husbands too. By the way I know such a clever girl. Those are not clever 
rather very wise girls. Because they have an idea 
how to manage their homes. And they know very well that the
man of the house needs peace only that they provide them to the fullest. Keep one thing in mind, auntie. And tell that to your son as well. that you shouldn't think that if you
kick me out, I'll be on the streets. I still have a home and I can go there. I just don't understand, Nosheen, 
why do you think like that? This is your home and it will always be.
Nobody wants to kick you out from here. I want that you and Faiq
always stay happy here. Just forget it auntie, there is a lot of
difference between saying and doing. Okay, hold on. Mom and me were waiting 
for you over dinner. Okay, you guys start, I'll join you. Look, Zaid, it's very simple. Just tell me who do you want
in your life. Aima or me? And if you can't leave Aima 
then you should divorce me. For God's sake, tell them to
have some mercy on my daughter. Yes, of course sister, now
that you have talked to me I will talk to sister
Nimra about it for sure. And if necessary I will talk to Faiq too. Nosheen, trust me dear. Don't you dare call me dear. 
I am not dear to you.
