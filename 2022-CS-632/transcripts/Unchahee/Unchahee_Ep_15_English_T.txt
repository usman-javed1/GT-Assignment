[0.04] From flowers and from buds
[4.55] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.23] When I saw you
[14.13] I learned how to chirp from you
[19.38] I just want to tell you
everything honestly.
[23.37] I can't see you being angry.
[26.84] Iâ€™m not angry with you, Aima.
[30.60] I'm just angry with me that I was
expecting more than required from you.
[35.27] Don't kill me, don't kill me.
[36.75] -You won't do it the easy way, will you?
-I'll tell you, don't kill me.
[40.06] Look, I didn't do it myself.
Someone had asked me to do it.
[44.54] -Stop lying!
-I am telling you seriously,
[46.73] -I was paid by someone to do it.
-Who paid you?
[49.63] There is this guy, Faisal.
He is a very cheap man.
[53.31] -Faisal who?
-There is this guy.
[56.37] And his girlfriend asked him
to do all this.
[62.29] Zaid, you were absolutely right.
[66.78] Everything has become like it was earlier.
[69.88] I just can't believe
[72.63] how did such a miracle happen in my life?
[77.50] The thing what you can understand
isn't a miracle.
[81.39] You're right.
[83.59] This, all of this is God's work.
[89.39] We humans aren't able to understand it.
[94.87] My God knows.
[98.20] How much I yearned for dad's love.
[103.19] For him patting my head,
looking at me with affection.
[110.38] You know, how much I cried and prayed.
[117.39] You're such a strange girl, Aima.
[123.04] You cry when you're sad,
you cry when you're happy.
[126.47] What can I do, Zaid?
[129.05] I have no other way to express my feelings.
[134.82] And right now I've got mixed feelings.
[138.84] -Why?
-I'm happy.
[141.42] I'm happy that God has listened to me.
[146.44] Ad sad because
[149.75] why did I lose hope from God.
[153.89] I also wonder how did
all this happen so suddenly.
[160.23] And I'm content because
[162.94] I have regained my place in dad's heart.
[168.69] And I'm just happy seeing you like this.
[173.03] You know, you're like an open book.
[178.11] Yes I am.
[180.03] But not everyone can read me.
[182.83] Just a few special people.
[187.28] -What are you looking at?
-I'm looking at you.
[190.62] -Why?
-It feels good to see you happy.
[193.69] You know I was just waiting
to see your face like this.
[200.09] And finally it feels like we have
no boundaries between us.
[205.01] -And it feels nice.
-Thank you so much, Zaid.
[208.09] -What for?
-For believing in me. For supporting me.
[213.79] And to take out time for me.
[217.75] And...
[221.16] for forgiving me.
[222.91] Okay, then, do one more thing for me.
[226.05] -Yes?
-Please don't cry.
[229.97] Keep smiling, you look good.
[234.95] That's more like it.
[247.98] What is your problem, Faisal?
[250.44] Here your drama is never-ending,
and there my family is on my nerves.
[256.08] Try to understand.
My brain is going to explode.
[262.00] What do you mean
that you can't send your family like this?
[264.92] Do they belong to a royal family
that I need to get rules made out for them?
[269.42] Convincing my dad is my headache,
just send your family tomorrow at any cost.
[275.71] And one hour means one hour.
[278.80] Bye.
[293.27] -She isn't here yet?
-I have called her, why don't you start?
[299.90] I want to talk to you all
about something very important.
[304.01] I have selected a proposal for
Nosheen and fixed her marriage.
[310.40] The marriage will be solemnized
at 8:00 pm on Saturday.
[313.03] There will be just a few people from
the family in the ceremony not many.
[318.59] Right after that, the groom's family
is going to take Nosheen with them.
[324.94] Zaid...
[327.94] Zaid, you'll have to make arrangements
for the dinner, for around 50 people.
[332.08] Okay, Dad.
[337.88] They haven't asked for
any dowry or anything,
[340.25] but still, just see
what you want to give.
[343.02] At least, tell me who is the guy,
how is the family?
[351.40] Enough, Dad. Enough with your drama.
[356.71] Do you think that I'm going to get married
and that too with a guy of your choice?
[369.30] Are you insane?
[370.58] -Don't you have a little pity
-Dad, calm down.
[372.30] -in your heart?
-Pity?
[373.79] -What are you trying to do?
-Just shut up, don't you dare to interfere!
[377.92] You have given her too much freedom.
[379.88] If you'll interfere I'm going
to slap you too.
[382.48] -Do whatever you want, I won't marry.
-Nosheen, stop misbehaving with dad.
[386.11] Do you see how rudely she is talking to me?
[388.60] Okay, Dad, calm down. Listen,
please sit down, have some water.
[391.96] -Don't get into this.
-Please, Dad, calm down.
[394.41] You know very well what they have done.
[396.30] Brother, brother, listen to me.
[399.00] Look, whatever it is, whoever is guilty,
just forgive her.
[404.51] -Just forgive her.
-Oh, you shut up!
[407.17] I don't know who has poisoned your ears.
[410.63] -You are hitting the honor of your home.
-Are you talking about the honor of my home?
[414.39] -Dad, Dad, please.
-I have covered the honor of my home,
[417.78] -that your daughter has tarnished.
-Nosheen, go to your room.
[420.51] -Let's go to your room, Nosheen.
-Take her and get lost!
[422.43] -Let's go, Nosheen.
-She is such a cheap girl.
[424.41] Come, Nosheen, let's go.
[429.42] Mother, Mother, you...
[433.45] -Mother, please sit.
-What just happened?
[436.58] -Please sit.
-What is wrong with this house?
[440.08] What's wrong? My God.
[502.01] I can't believe my eyes,
[506.16] what I have just seen.
[510.19] I just don't understand what happened
to brother. He has never done like that.
[517.31] Nosheen must have done
something wrong, Mother,
[521.48] because of which Dad was so furious.
[527.75] But I have never seen him
this angry all my life.
[534.82] Okay, just don't worry and take rest now.
[537.10] No, I can't take rest.
[541.47] Mother, why are you taking stress.
Doctor has told you not to.
[546.74] How can I not take stress?
[549.66] I am not a selfish person,
[551.10] look at the environment in the house.
[553.65] How can I just mind my own business?
[556.45] The environment of the house
can't improve by your taking stress.
[560.35] Brother doesn't like to raise his voice
with the women of the house.
[565.42] And today, he raised his hand.
[573.04] I'm sure, I'm sure my house
is under someone's evil eye.
[579.95] At times, one doesn't need an outsider
to destroy the house.
[592.90] Insiders are enough for that.
[600.72] I'm sure, whatever decision
dad is taking it is right.
[607.21] Mother, Nosheen must have done something
[610.43] due to which Dad is compelled
to take this decision.
[614.94] Still, hitting her in front of everyone,
[620.50] and getting her married
without her consent.
[623.14] I just don't get it.
[625.29] What kind of justice is this?
[628.09] Mother, don't try
to think too much about it.
[631.15] May be all of this is better for Nosheen.
[637.26] She'll get matured after marriage.
[640.80] Please ignore all of this right now.
[643.76] Dear, I'm very worried.
[648.87] I'm actually worried, she is my niece.
[655.23] My heart is tearing because of her pain.
[659.10] She is Dad's child.
[661.78] He must be in greater pain
than you, right now.
[665.28] And you say it yourself that at times
taking tough decisions becomes necessary.
[673.08] No.
[675.22] I don't think it's a tough decision.
[678.55] I think it's a wrong decision.
[685.92] I, I'm going to talk to brother myself.
[691.89] Please, Mother, please don't do that.
[696.85] Even before this, whenever
you got involved in her issues,
[699.98] you have become the bad one in it.
[704.03] Nosheen has dug this ditch for herself,
[706.50] and she is going to bear
the consequences herself.
[710.19] Mother, if you really want the
best for her then just pray for her.
[715.34] Come on.
[717.91] Come and lie down.
[733.73] You have hit your adult daughter
in front of everyone.
[738.84] Would you like to clarify, Mr. Azmat?
[742.68] It's better
that we don't discuss it right now.
[745.07] You can do whatever you want
to, and no one can question you.
[750.95] You taunt me a thousand times on my single
mistake, and it is your fault actually.
[756.87] You have put the burden of your
negligence on my shoulders so easily.
[762.44] Just because of a slap?
[764.56] Means, even this is my fault?
[767.55] Not fault, call it a crime.
[771.16] You haven't given your children
their right, that's a huge crime.
[775.73] Am I going to deprive
them of their right?
[777.77] I'm their mother,
I have given birth to them.
[782.07] It's not enough to give them birth only.
[784.44] Consideration, attention, upbringing,
[788.92] one has to become their shade,
one has to teach them the worldly affairs.
[792.40] It was their right,
in which you have failed.
[797.53] Almas, you have been completely dishonest.
[800.31] I tired my level best
[804.40] that my wife never faces
a thing called poverty.
[807.12] There should be no financial problems.
[809.96] Nobody should point fingers at my children.
[811.84] That she can bring them up properly,
take care of them.
[814.31] I hired servants in the house so that
there is no problem outside the house too.
[818.31] so that you can stay
with the children care free.
[822.53] But sadly, the time you have bought
for your children
[827.30] you spent it on your entertainment.
[831.91] Shopping, friends' meet-up,
make overs, kitty parties.
[838.40] And today, I can say this
with full confidence
[842.60]  that some things can't be bought.
[846.42] Do you mean to say that your children
have been brought up on the streets?
[851.65] They are brought up on the streets,
you can say that.
[854.63] They have been brought up by servants.
[857.37] They don't have any manners
nor any etiquette.
[860.99] Raising three children together
isn't easy, Azmat.
[865.19] What else have you done?
[866.96] Tell me, what have you done?
[869.51] Besides, Zaid has been with Shabana
all his childhood.
[872.04] If she has fed him food for a few days,
then has she replaced his mother?
[878.16] If you had been home ever, you would have
known how much three children tease you.
[883.50] I wish.
[886.03] I wish, I didn't get so busy in earning
money and making a future for my children.
[893.46] I was mistaken that there
is a woman at my home
[898.26] Who is looking after my home,
who is raising my children.
[901.43] You have an idea about your hard-work only.
[904.64] Only I know how I've raised these children.
[908.47] Yes, it's not that difficult.
[910.62] Children are dependent on their
parents just for the first few years.
[915.10] After that one has to be
with them just like a guide.
[917.71]  One has to answer the questions they ask.
[921.24] The real job is to become their shadow,
[924.37] to keep an eye on their activities.
[926.69] Anyway, no mother can stay
with her kids for 24 hours.
[930.90] And you are telling me
to sacrifice all my hobbies?
[934.45] Yes, it would have been better
 if you had sacrificed them.
[937.29] Because hobbies can be taken up later on,
[940.01] but the childhood of children
can never return.
[943.39] God hasn't placed heaven
under a mother's feet just like that.
[947.60] It's really painful for me to say
that you are an unsuccessful mother,
[952.67] an unsuccessful wife.
[960.43] The slap that Nosheen has got today,
[963.24] that hasn't hit her,
but to your upbringing.
[1013.43] Hello, yes, Faisal?
[1016.29] Dad didn't agree. Dad has crossed
all limits of misbehaving.
[1023.29] I have no other option other than
running away from home.
[1027.32] Everyone has died for me.
[1033.20] Just make arrangements, I'm going
to run away from this home before Saturday.
[1071.41] -Did you call me?
-Sit down.
[1079.11] This is the boy's picture, take a look.
[1081.58] And if you want, show it to your daughter.
[1084.37] He is much elder than Nosheen.
[1089.37] He is bald too.
[1091.84] The guy isn't of much age,
it just seems so. He is just 32.
[1096.49] Are you aware of what you are doing?
[1098.73] This guy is too old,
[1101.82] and weren't they ashamed either
for asking Nosheen's hand in marriage?
[1105.67] They didn't give the proposal,
in fact I was the one who initiated it.
[1109.47] I am telling you,
just ask them to excuse you.
[1112.70] I'm going to look
for an appropriate match for her.
[1116.31] You wasted the time
that I had given you for this task.
[1120.39] Just give me one more week.
[1123.10] Not at all. That's my final decision.
[1128.33] Don't you have even a little consideration
for your daughter?
[1130.67] Can't you stand Nosheen
even for a little longer in this house?
[1135.73] So that we can look
for an appropriate match for her?
[1138.81] And by the way, why do you think
that I am being cruel to Nosheen.
[1143.47] I couldn't find any better
and appropriate match for her.
[1147.49] They are nice people.
[1149.20] They are a well off family,
the guy has a personality.
[1152.44] I know him personally.
He'll take good care of her.
[1155.54] I'd still say that you are rushing it.
[1159.40] There is a reason. There is a reason
to it that's why I am compelled to rush it.
[1164.43] -It's my compulsion.
-What compulsion?
[1168.47] My experience is telling me that this girl
has reached to a point of being shameless,
[1172.23] that the sense of crime
has died in her too.
[1174.89] My heart is telling me that if we
don't marry her off as soon as possible
[1177.27] then she is going to cause such a mischief
that we can't even think of.
[1181.41] At least our dignity is safe yet.
[1183.16] Please, please let me explain her once.
I'll talk to her.
[1188.29] We'll look for a good proposal for her. 
Please don't be so cruel to her.
[1192.53] I've told you all ready, I'm not
getting her married to some ordinary guy.
[1197.24] I'm doing what is best for her.
[1201.94] Get her ready. 
The groom's family is coming to meet her.
[1220.06] Honestly, Aima, 
I'm really happy to see you happy.
[1225.71] I faced many crisis 
and got rid of them so quickly too.
[1233.78] I just wish such a time never comes again.
[1238.03] Oh, why have you started talking 
like old aunties?
[1243.77] Are you okay? I have to share 
so many gossip with you.
[1248.31] You know, that Kinza?
[1252.38] I don't think that there affair 
is going to last much longer.
[1255.83] The other day, Zaid proved 
that he isn't that crazy after Kinza.
[1260.82] What did he do?
[1263.45] I was with him, she was calling him and
he said right after picking the call that,
[1268.41] "If someone's not replying then you
should understand that he is busy."
[1274.54] So, what does that mean?
[1276.51] So, stupid, this means she isn't that
important for him as we thought she is.
[1285.18] I means, she is not even near our level.
[1288.80] But why did he do so?
[1291.93] Idiot, because of you.
[1295.49] Because of me?
[1297.31] Yes, your issue was going on at that
time so his temper was high already.
[1302.64] And even if I had said something
to him, he would have scolded me.
[1305.69] He was that mad.
[1310.76] Aima, what's up with you?
[1313.54] Say something, 
is you tube light switched off?
[1318.85] No, it's nothing like that. 
He worries like that for everyone.
[1323.63] Not at all, he doesn't
do this for everyone.
[1325.92] He just says that we both are equal for him, 
but he gives you more importance.
[1333.82] At times I really feel jealous.
[1337.36] No Zoya, he is as concerned 
for you as he is for me.
[1341.41] -Don't worry.
-Anyway,
[1344.86] we just drifted away from the topic.
[1347.15] I think that there are no chances
of Kinza to become Mrs. Zaid.
[1354.49] Is everything okay in your home?
[1358.13] Why has everyone walking around 
with a long face.
[1360.57] Or do they look like that?
[1363.57] Actually, dad is getting Nosheen married.
[1367.76] Oh really? Well, thank God.
[1372.03] I support uncle's decision 
for the first time.
[1378.40] Girls like her deserve it.
[1380.66] What has she done to you
that you're saying this?
[1384.36] What? Don't you know?
[1388.77] You really don't know what she has done?
[1390.71] I have no idea, but dad 
is really angry with her.
[1394.87] She must have done something wrong.
[1400.54] But still, I feel that it's unfair to her.
[1406.90] Now I know. Didn't Zaid tell you anything?
[1411.54] What didn't he tell me?
[1413.59] Everything. He has done so much, 
but he didn't tell you?
[1430.95] -Did my daughter have something to eat?
-Yes, I did, Mama.
[1435.14] That's very nice. One shouldn't
stop eating even if one's angry.
[1440.28] Angry at what?
[1443.64] That thing which your dad did.
[1447.63] He called me a while ago.
[1451.58] Why? To tell you something more?
[1454.01] No, he was apologetic, 
but I didn't listen to him at all.
[1461.78] I said, who the hell are you 
to hit my daughter.
[1467.84] You shouldn't have said that.
[1469.74] He is my dad, I misbehaved with him.
[1472.72] But, Nosheen, what's wrong is wrong.
[1476.17] And he is getting me married.
[1481.06] Nosheen, I've said him a lot of things, 
but he doesn't listen to me.
[1487.36] They are coming to meet you.
[1492.50] Nice, I'm there would-be
daughter-in-law, they should meet me.
[1497.53] Don't worry it's a nice family. 
They are well off.
[1502.77] And they have a bungalow in our area.
[1506.50] -I mean, it's almost perfect.
-Almost?
[1511.68] Yes, Nosheen, the guy is a little older.
[1516.89] Not too much, just a little.
[1520.06] That happens when it's 
an arrange marriage. Not a big deal.
[1526.91] Your dad has sent this picture of the guy.
[1531.83] That's nice. Let me see.
[1539.47] What is it? Didn't you like him?
[1542.04] He's okay. In fact it would be better
if he adopts me instead of marrying me.
[1548.57] Stop it, Nosheen, he's not that old.
[1552.12] I'm telling the truth, Mama, there must be 
at least a gap of two generations.
[1557.17] One has to make some sacrifices 
in an arrange marriage.
[1563.30] Everybody has some qualities 
and some faults.
[1566.84] Now, he is older so he is going
to take care of me like dad too.
[1570.77] What's wrong with you? 
How are you talking?
[1575.42] What happened, Mama? 
Did I misbehave with you?
[1579.97] No, no. Neither you are arguing, 
nor being stubborn.
[1584.36] You are talking so politely, 
it seems weird.
[1588.83] Oh, Mama, I am practicing to talk politely.
[1592.75] There are not much days left 
for me in this house.
[1600.10] What happened? Did I say something wrong?
[1603.42] No, that's a really good thing. 
It's just that I don't believe it.
[1610.84] Oh, come on. Believe it, 
why do you doubt so much?
[1615.12] Looks like my daughter is mentally disturbed
by knowing about her sudden marriage.
[1629.91] Oh, okay.
[1632.76] But, Aima,
[1635.55] Why didn't Zaid tell you all this?
[1644.95] What could have Zaid told me, Mother?
[1647.90] That his sister has done 
such a bad thing to me?
[1654.66] He is hiding from me 
because he is so ashamed.
[1659.62] Even I won't be able to look him
in the eye after knowing all this.
[1666.77] Really,
[1670.31] it must be challenging for him.
[1672.97] Mother, I don't want to see Zaid 
and dad anymore in stress.
[1678.77] That's why I've...
[1681.49] forgiven Nosheen.
[1685.92] Aima,
[1689.69] you know, you're my pride.
[1697.03] -Mother, shall I ask you something?
-Sure, go ahead.
[1703.92] What do you think when you forgive people?
[1712.53] -By thinking of God's plan.
-What plan, Mother?
[1717.68] You know that God says
[1723.34] That the way you expect me to forgive you,
[1728.73] you should also forgive others 
the same way.
[1734.63] The one dearest to God is the one
[1738.24] who forgives others.
[1742.50] Whatever problem God puts us in, 
he gives us relief with that too.
[1750.44] Yes, Mother, you are right.
[1756.62] With every passing day,
[1759.87] my belief on God is getting even stronger.
[1764.45] You can see for yourself,
[1766.63] The house in which God gave us difficult
relations in sister and Nosheen's form,
[1773.06]  to test us,
[1776.30] he has given us ease in the same house  
in brother and Zaid's form.
[1782.68] That's why, we should forgive them.
[1785.43] Or else it will be counted 
as thanklessness of God.
[1792.49] Aima?
[1795.61] What are you thinking?
[1797.91] -Nothing.
-Then why are you smiling?
[1802.66] I am thinking that my mother's heart
isn't made of gold but of diamond.
[1814.89] Look, dear,
[1817.29] remember one thing.
[1818.94] You will come across good, bad, 
all sorts of people in your life.
[1824.02] You have to face good and bad times too.
[1826.97] It's just that we should stay strong.
[1830.81] And most importantly,
[1832.50] we must always have faith in God.
[1840.32] If one faces bad times, God always
does something good in those times too.
[1845.93] Like Zaid and dad in our lives.
[1851.61] Yes, you are absolutely right.
[1856.42] Zaid is a very nice boy.
[1858.96] See how he solved our issue so nicely,
[1865.19] he never thought about himself.
[1867.84] We should be indebted to him.
[1871.78] No doubt,
[1874.39] that kid is one in a million.
[1876.94] He takes care of me a lot.
[1880.63] And I have never felt the need of a son 
because Zaid was always there.
[1889.67] I always wished to have Zaid 
as my son in law.
[1901.90] But,
[1904.14] the situation in the house 
is telling something else.
[1909.39] Anyhow,
[1911.94] my God is the Glorious one.
[1915.09] My Lord.
