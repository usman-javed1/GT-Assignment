[0.03] From flowers and from buds
[4.48] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.15] When I saw you
[14.11] I learned how to chirp from you
[18.98] Call Faisal right away,
or let me talk to him on the phone.
[21.73] What did I tell you? Lower your voice.
Don't you understand?
[26.99] I won't, what are you going to do?
[29.38] To hell with you both,
do you think I'm mad?
[32.07] Listen, girl, if you misbehave even once
[34.55] then you will be responsible
for the consequences.
[36.57] You should be thankful that even after this
behaviour your dignity is still intact.
[40.54] Brother, just tell me
what should I say to her now?
[43.86] Tell her anything.
Tell her I have left for Dubai.
[47.85] Excellent, you have thought
of such an international excuse.
[51.51] Yes, she will be at ease
after knowing about Dubai.
[55.05] Or else if she gets to know that I am here
[56.55] then she will find me and won't
give up until I marry her.
[59.09] What happened then? Where did that guy go?
[64.06] And why was Nosheen leaving from there?
[67.67] I don't know.
[72.70] If Nosheen got happy after seeing you
[76.60] it means that that guy has defrauded her.
[85.58] Might be.
[87.61] Did you talk to Nosheen?
[91.75] I just did what my duty was.
[94.19] Other than that, honestly I
don't want to know anything
[96.48]  and I don't know anything either.
[98.23] It's between Mama and Nosheen now.
[120.16] Mama.
[122.29] Don’t call me your mama.
[125.14] Aren't you ashamed to embarrass
your mother in front of the whole world?
[129.59] Mama, I'm sorry.
[132.00] Don't say sorry. It's not
like you've broken a piece of crockery
[135.13]  that you apologize
for it and we will get a new one.
[139.52] Nosheen nothing can be brought back now.
[141.80] Why did you even come back?
[146.10] Why didn’t you die there?
[148.51] -Mama, at least don't scold me.
-Why not?
[152.47] If I could, I would kill you, Nosheen.
[156.57] I always used to tell you that
that guy is not right.
[159.48] But all you could think about was love.
[164.32] Mama, had I known that he is
such a big fraud
[168.34] then I wouldn't have ever done it.
[170.08] You just needed a chance
to do something stupid.
[172.75] Nosheen, since the day you have
been born my life has been in a turmoil.
[178.99] Why are you crying now?
[181.16] Have you compromised you chastity?
[182.54] No it's nothing like that.
[184.66] That scoundrel was only
interested in my money.
[188.56] Tell me where are those jewelry sets?
[191.86] Tell me. Just say something,
where are those diamond sets?
[196.30] I don't have them, Mama.
[198.79] Nosheen, don't tell me
that he has run away with them.
[206.40] Such a huge loss.
[208.59] Our honor and money, both have been robbed.
[212.20] You scumbag.
[213.79] Don't say that, Mama. I'm
accepting that I committed a mistake.
[220.08] Your dad is going to suck my blood.
[223.07] I've got such a bad fate.
[226.39] Mama, don't worry, I won't spare him.
[230.09] Just see what I'm going to do with him.
[232.01] Just shut up, Nosheen.
[234.28] Aren't you done humiliating us?
[237.72] Mama, I know that I've ruined
everything, just give me a chance.
[242.54] No more chances for you.
[245.94] You thought of yourself as something,
you have disgraced yourself, Nosheen.
[253.08] After what you have done,
people would despise you.
[260.05] Now stay here, until your
father feels pity for you.
[283.44] I think, I should talk to sister.
[290.48] It's a difficult time for her.
[292.93] I should encourage her.
[297.01] Poor sister is alone in such a time.
[300.89] And in such times, one needs
someone to encourage them.
[306.57] Mother, I'd suggest you not to do it.
[309.26] What do you mean?
[312.64] There has been such a huge incident.
[316.22] Her daughter's wedding has been called off.
[318.77] And everyone in the family now knows
that Nosheen had run away from home.
[324.79] Even the neighbours are
saying all sorts of things.
[330.69] What would be a mother
going through in such a time.
[335.90] Mother, there are many others
with whom she can share her pain.
[340.39] What are you talking about, Aima?
[343.62] It's our duty to be compassionate
towards her.
[347.96] But Mother, you shouldn't forget
[350.01] that whenever you try
to be a part of their matters
[352.09] then you become
the bad one eventually.
[354.00] Look, I'm not going to give her any advice.
[362.75] I'm just going to console her.
[364.86] If you actually want to console,
then do it for Dad.
[370.65] He is more hurt than auntie, and alone too.
[374.21] That is understood. He is my brother.
[378.63] It's necessary for me to support him.
[385.52] Besides, he just goes quiet
when he suffers form such a sorrow.
[389.92] You are right, Mother. The bigger
the sorrow is, the quieter he gets.
[396.35] A father's and brother's honor
are the girls of the house.
[401.03] And when girls ruin this honor
[407.77] then men break from inside.
[412.12] Yes, Mother, you are absolutely right.
[415.15] Zaid, is also very disturbed
because of Nosheen.
[418.40] Yes, dear.
[421.93] Take care of him.
[424.17] One really needs a friend in such times.
[429.40] Look, he has never left you alone
in your difficult times.
[436.76] He has always been by your side
in every tough situation.
[442.31] Yes, Zaid has done a lot of favors to me.
[447.80] Yes, dear, it's your turn now
to return all those favors.
[456.33] Yes, mother.
[464.49] I'm not going to spare that Faisal.
What does he think of himself?
[468.61] Just watch, what I'm going to do to him.
[471.03] I'm going to file a report against him.
[474.78] I am going to find him, no
matter where he is hiding.
[478.50] He will be accountable of each and
every penny of mine that he has embezzled.
[491.43] Mom, what's with her?
When is this madam going away?
[495.66] Don't say like that.
[498.25] She'll leave in a  few days. It's
just been a day since she is here.
[502.35] Mom, you know well that I
don't mind anybody's presence.
[505.63] But I can't stand that girl.
[507.76] I know, but what can I do I'm also just
doing it because of my relation with her.
[512.38] Zaid called me and asked for a favor.
[516.99] Yes, it's nice that you
are giving him a favor, but...
[521.96] you don't know
how problematic this girl is.
[526.92] When I was coming down,
I heard her talking loudly to someone.
[530.80] She is so weird.
[533.59] What can I do? I was thinking myself
[537.42] that while giving this favor what
if I might get in some trouble myself.
[544.69] By the way, are you going somewhere?
[548.03] I was going to meet Zaid.
[550.21] Aima called. She said
that Zaid is really worried.
[555.02] -So I was just going to cheer him up.
-Okay.
[560.55] Come sit.
[562.55] No I won't sit. I just wanted
to ask you something.
[566.42] Yes, sure, what is it?
[568.34] Auntie, I wanted to go somewhere
for some work, so I need you car.
[572.84] Can you please ask the driver?
[578.14] It isn't possible
because I am going with the driver.
[581.57] And mama is going to office in her car.
[584.05] Then why don't you drop me, auntie?
[588.13] I have no issues in dropping you,
[594.12] but it would be better if you call
sister and ask for her permission.
[599.44] Yes, it's better that you ask
for auntie's permission, first.
[603.93] So am I going to stay like
a prisoner in this house too?
[608.29] No, no. I didn't mean that at all.
[613.10] I can't do anything. Sister has strictly
told me not to send you anywhere.
[618.31] That is why I was saying it.
[633.83] You can't believe, Shabana,
[637.17] without Nosheen, all this,
the house seems so empty.
[642.29] I haven't slept for so many days.
[648.92] Yes, sister, daughter's have
their own presence in the house.
[652.93] I can understand your condition.
[656.18] Shabana, I can't look at her empty room.
[660.60] I haven't gone in their since then.
[664.86] It's just a test by God.
[670.81] God will ease every
difficulty with his will.
[675.94] I feel relieved after you have come.
[680.72] What are you talking about, sister.
[683.25] Those who stay under one roof
share their sorrows and happiness.
[687.69] Really? Do you mean it?
[694.16] I thought, why would you care about us?
[697.68] Your daughter
is flourishing in front of you.
[702.81] No, sister, Nosheen is my own child.
[707.34] Do you mean it?
[711.38] Or is this just hypocrisy?
[714.02] And in reality you are happy within
that my daughter has left this home.
[719.21] No, it's not like that, sister.
[721.95] I want to see her back in
this home as soon as possible.
[725.08] Really?
[726.99] Yes, sister. I don't know
how to prove it to you.
[734.28] Shabana, do you actually want
to do something good for me?
[737.68] Yes, sister.
[742.14] obviously.
[744.61] But why are you asking this question?
[747.98] Not questioning, I'm begging you.
[753.80] please try to talk to Azmat.
[758.07] About what?
[759.74] That he takes Nosheen back in.
[762.72] He never refuses what you and Aima ask him.
[768.96] Yes, sister. Actually,
[772.95] Please don't say no.
For your daughter's sake.
[778.75] Look how much we have done for you.
[780.74] How many favor have we done to you.
[785.38] And this is the time that you
shall return those favors,
[791.11] and help us.
[794.15] Yes, sister,
I'll definitely talk to brother.
[799.58] But I can't say if he
would listen to me or not.
[806.72] You know very well
how angry he is right now.
[810.52] Oh, yes. Now you'll make excuses
because I has asked you for a favor.
[817.46] You want me to beg in front of you
and cry for help?
[822.82] No, no. I didn't mean that.
[826.67] I will try my best to convince brother.
[831.40] I myself want to see Nosheen
back in this home.
[835.38] Shabana, do whatever you can.
[837.83] Please, convince Azmat that
he bring Nosheen back home.
[842.34] -Just do anything.
-Sister,
[844.91] please don't embarrass me, I understand.
[850.19] I will try my best.
[856.07] Sister, it's difficult for me
to take Nosheen's responsibility.
[863.68] She is really ill-mannered.
She doesn't listen to me.
[868.80] How strict can I be with her.
[871.76] Why did I become unwanted
[876.31] Nobody knows that
[881.02] Why did I become unwanted
[885.49] Nobody knows that
[901.60] Zaid , till when this drama
of yours is going to last?
[905.29] Drama? Had this happened
to you,
[907.53] I would have asked you if it's a
drama or something else.
[911.35] I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.
[915.03] See, Nosheen has been found,
why don't you cheer up then?
[919.56] Yes, Zaid, Nosheen is back,
now please cheer up.
[922.58] We both are really worried about you.
[927.29] I'm fine. I just need some time.
[929.67] -No, this can't happen.
-What can't happen?
[933.98] Means we are not going to leave you alone.
[938.47] Zaid, Zoya has come for you
and you are asking her to leave?
[941.95] How wrong.
[945.41] I know you're worried for Nosheen.
[948.95] I am not worried for Nosheen,
I'm worried because of Nosheen.
[962.52] -Say something at least.
-I've got a headache.
[966.97] -Let me get a pain killer for you.
-No need for that.
[970.82] I know how to get rid of his headache.
[973.05] Really how?
[974.83] Tell me, how is Kinza doing?
[979.58] Please, now don't take her name.
[983.95] Why? What has happened that you
don't even like us to take her name?
[988.03] She is a girl of bad character.
[994.99] What do you mean?
[996.53] I was thinking my self since
a few days to break up with her,
[999.25] but then she gave me
a very solid reason to do that.
[1003.62] What reason? Tell us too.
[1006.05] She was dating three people at a time.
[1008.91] Faraz told me...
[1013.54] Wow, great, I thought you guys
came to cheer me up. Great, just great.
[1018.55] Please, leave.
[1022.28] -Yes, that's all right.
-Yes we came to cheer you up,
[1025.76] but after giving this news
you have cheered us up.
[1031.44] Sorry.
[1034.47] -I'm going from here.
-Zaid.
[1054.85] -How are you Shabana?
-I'm fine, brother.
[1058.24] Are you taking your medicines timely?
[1059.77] You have your appointment
with the doctor tomorrow.
[1062.78] I am not sure about the appointment
but I'm taking my medicines on time.
[1071.65] It's possible that they
change your medicine.
[1076.05] Okay, brother.
[1078.12] Okay, I'm going to rest now.
Got really tired today.
[1081.04] Brother,
[1084.21] can you please stay with me for a while.
[1090.67] What is it brother,
you don't seem all right.
[1096.38] You seem a little burdened.
[1099.92] -I'm fine.
-Still,
[1104.09] if there is anything let me know.
[1106.46] One feels relieved after sharing.
[1109.85] Shabana, when
[1112.55] a person's children put his honor at stake,
[1119.01] then no matter how confident he is,
[1122.09] how broad his shoulders are, they bend.
[1128.11] What my daughter has done to me,
[1129.79] I don't think I will ever be able
to look anyone in the eye after that.
[1132.82] She has humiliated me in
front of the world in such a way
[1135.01] that I have lost all my pride.
[1138.77] Brother,
[1141.10] the only One who can give us
respect or humiliate us is the God.
[1146.30] But the human has some
responsibilities too, Shabana.
[1151.73] Wasn't it my daughter's
responsibility to keep my dignity intact.
[1155.34] Yes, of course.
[1162.12] But when a person
can't fulfill his responsibility,
[1169.41] then God doesn't stop
being merciful to him.
[1174.09] In fact He gives him chances
over and over again to forgive him.
[1178.88] Brother,
[1181.39] you should forgive too.
[1183.44] Whom should I? Whom should I forgive?
[1187.09] And whose mistakes should I let go?
[1191.44] And I may forgive by suppressing my anger,
[1196.53] but at least someone should ask
for forgiveness from me sincerely.
[1199.85] If a person repents sincerely
then even God forgives him.
[1203.72] You're right.
[1205.31] Almas often asks me to forgive
Hammad, but how can I forgive him?
[1213.86] When he hasn't even come
to asks for forgiveness.
[1216.24] He should at least ask me,
at least be ashamed of his deeds.
[1220.31] Don't know how long it has been,
he hasn't come to say sorry even once.
[1224.58] If he can't face me
he could at least call me.
[1228.67] Brother, please don't lose hope.
[1235.47] You'll see, he will definitely ask
for your forgiveness.
[1242.09] How can he stay happy
without his parents and siblings.
[1251.52] If not today, he will admit
his mistakes tomorrow.
[1256.79] No, no, no Shabana.
[1261.79] They both are a rebellion from inside.
[1264.94] They will always keep blaming
me for their mistakes, but I...
[1271.03] I have steeled myself now.
[1273.58] I have accepted
that my own people are at fault.
[1276.94] I will have to live with this truth.
[1280.44] Brother, if Nosheen asks for forgiveness...
[1285.14] Don't you even take her name
in front of me.
[1287.80] This isn't going to happen.
[1291.23] You take rest.
[1310.87] Sister, it's getting really difficult
for me to take responsibility for Nosheen.
[1318.54] She is very ill-mannered.
[1320.78] She doesn't listen to me.
[1323.60] After all how strict can I be with her.
[1327.88] Even today she was insisting to go out.
[1330.68] How can I let her go outside?
[1332.98] When I told her that she can't
[1334.40] then she stamped her feet in
anger and went upstairs.
[1336.37] No you did very right, Amber.
[1339.86] This girl can't be trusted anymore.
[1343.31] After all you have
given me her responsibility.
[1346.79] I can't guard her all the time
leaving everything.
[1354.97] I didn't go to work even today
because of her.
[1357.99] No, Amber, I'm going
to tell her myself. Where is she?
[1363.05] -She went upstairs to the room.
-Nosheen!
[1367.85] Nosheen.
[1369.46] Sister, maybe the door is closed,
that's why she can't hear you.
[1374.22] -Let me check.
-Yes, but let me come along too.
[1378.08] Just tell her in front of me that
you haven't allowed her to go out.
[1389.42] Nosheen, Nosheen?
[1406.25] Amber, this girl has cheated us again.
[1409.90] No, sister, relax, don't worry.
She might be somewhere in the house.
[1420.63] Dad, may I come in?
[1422.17] Oh, Zaid, come. What brings you here?
[1429.99] It's my dad's office.
Do I need a reason to be here?
[1434.34] Can't I come here just like that?
[1435.33] Yes of course you can, but I wasn't
expecting you here like this.
[1439.48] You should expect, Dad.
[1441.77] You always wanted me to take
care of your business when I grow up.
[1446.33] I have stop expecting anything
from my children.
[1449.76] And expecting anything good
is out of question.
[1452.67] Dad, even fro me?
[1457.78] What did I get having
expectations from the other two
[1459.40] that I'd get anything from you?
[1464.87] But I'm not like them, Dad.
And you know it.
[1472.87] I can understand your
tension and your sorrow,
[1475.26] but I will try my best that me
or my decisions never hurt you.
[1483.23] Anyways, it's good that you are here.
I'll let you meet the research team.
[1487.29] We are discussing some new ideas.
[1490.69] You can give your opinion as well.
[1492.42] I would love to.
[1496.29] But right now, I came to talk
to you about something else.
[1502.47] You can talk to me about anyone
except for Nosheen.
[1506.17] Dad a problem doesn't get solved
if we stop talking about it.
[1510.55] Till when are you going to avoid it?
[1512.14] Her living at auntie's like this
isn't appropriate at all.
[1515.46] Zaid, I have much more
experience than you do.
[1519.19] I know very well what is good
for whom and what not.
[1521.78] Whatever is happening to her is very less,
she deserves a lot more than that.
[1526.66] -Dad...
-Excuse me.
[1532.72] Yes, Mr. Ikram. Send research analyst,
Yousuf and his team members to my room.
[1539.37] Coffee?
[1541.43] Sure.
[1545.34] Send two coffees. please. Thank you.
[1554.34] If she doesn't come home by herself this
time, then we won't go to look for her too.
[1558.98] To hell with her!
[1560.88] Don't say like that, sister. Just pray
that she returns the same way she left.
[1565.23] If she won't return
then we'll be worried again that...
[1570.73] Where were you?
[1572.57] Do you have any idea how worried I was?
[1574.58] Why did I become unwanted
[1579.16] Nobody knows that
[1583.90] Why did I become unwanted
[1588.46] Nobody knows that
[1598.86] What? Zaid and office?
[1603.14] What are you talking about?
[1605.56] You have heard it right.
[1608.76] But long drives, outings, 
all these things suit Zaid.
[1614.19] Why had he gone to office?
[1617.03] Actually, I’m the one 
who sent him to dad''s office.
[1621.23] But why?
[1622.37] I’ve sent Zaid to talk 
to him about Nosheen.
[1627.42] Auntie is too worried 
and I really can't see her like that.
[1631.77] Oh, come on, Aima. Had auntie been
worried, all this wouldn't have happened.
[1636.74] Whatever it is, Zoya,
[1638.18] Auntie requested me
that me and mother
[1640.97] should request dad 
to let Nosheen come back.
[1644.35] So, did she talk about it?
[1647.37] No, this time dad isn't ready 
to even listen to mother.
[1653.91] Nosheen has done such a thing that
[1656.36] I can't even find 
the courage to talk to dad.
[1659.47] That's why I asked Zaid to go to office.
[1663.00] Maybe dad gets happy by him
going there and agree to his request.
[1667.92] Oh, I see.
[1671.50] Aima, do anything 
but take that girl from our home.
[1674.50] I mean, she is on my nerves.
[1677.33] She's so irritating.
[1679.29] Please, Aima, it's a request.
[1681.12] Zoya, we're trying that dad agrees.
[1684.90] Let's see when he does.
[1687.30] Aima, I am bugging you 
for so long sitting here
[1691.98] because I want to stay away 
from that problematic girl.
[1695.68] I know, she is a bit difficult.
[1698.88] Anyway, let's talk about something else.
[1701.87] Okay, fine. So what 
do you want to talk about?
[1706.52] Let's talk about marriage.
[1708.79] By the way, have you ever thought about it?
[1711.87] Zoya, why did you think 
of asking such a question suddenly?
[1716.55] We can't deny that 
it's our age to get married.
[1719.92] I mean everybody thinks 
about it in this age.
[1723.63] Like how is her husband going to be, 
how will her in-laws be like?
[1728.06] Don't tell me 
that you haven't thought about it.
[1730.89] Seriously, I haven't thought about it ever.
[1734.65] Exactly. Someone you doesn't even exist
in your life, how can you imagine him?
[1742.90] But I don't know, I don't like anyone.
[1745.63] I have met 4 people for it, 
and rejected a 400.
[1750.09] I can understand. You're too choosy.
[1753.21] If you don't choose 
your friends that easily,
[1756.68] then this is a matter of choosing
your life partner, you'll take your time.
[1760.86] Exactly, I can't accept 
someone that easily.
[1765.24] I've got a small circle 
and I'm happy with that.
[1769.13] And to tell you the truth,
I don't feel the need of anyone else.
[1774.23] But I will have to get
married soon,
[1776.23] because it's my mom's wish 
and I can't help it.
[1779.70] Zoya she must be worried about you.
[1782.02] After all you are her responsibility.
[1784.15] Like the way my mother is worried about me.
[1787.42] Because they both don't have 
their life partners with them.
[1791.84] That's true. That's the reason 
I agreed to what mother said.
[1797.02] Had dad been there, 
I wouldn't have listened to her at all.
[1800.38] These mothers, I tell you. 
They emotional blackmail you so much.
[1805.03] I am thinking these days, 
how my would be husband is going to be?
[1809.12] Will I ever be able 
to manage things with him?
[1811.68] Will I be able to adjust with his family?
[1814.51] Will we be able to cooperate. 
I mean, you get my point?
[1818.31] Just relax, Zoya. Everything is going 
to happen with time.
[1822.51] You just have to accept your
husband's family sincerely as your own.
[1827.55] Oh, come on. You're going 
to be a perfect house-wife.
[1831.17] I mean, who is
intelligent, and confident,
[1834.04] and who knows how to
make round chapatis too.
[1837.90] And you're going to win 
everyone's heart just like that.
[1841.26] I have that much confidence on you.
[1843.04] By the way, Zoya, if
you're going to get married,
[1846.39] what's going to happen
to your modeling passion?
[1848.59] What do you mean what's going to happen,
[1850.73] I'm going to do it 
whenever I get a chance.
[1854.18] And if your husband or your in-laws 
have an objection on it then?
[1858.63] So what? It's my life and my decision.
[1862.34] Why would I let 
anyone else decide for me?
[1865.72] Like every field, 
this field has many issues too.
[1869.68] I don't make friends there.
[1872.33] I just go there for work and...
I'll keep on trying.
[1878.57] God willing, if anyone comes 
he's going to bring his fate with him.
[1884.55] This example is used for girls you fool.
[1889.04] Yeah, whatever, it's the same thing.
[1891.06] When are you going to get wise?
[1894.05] When you'll get wise.
[1900.26] This girl has ruined my honor.
[1903.66] It would have been better 
that I had died before seeing this day.
[1907.80] How am I going to tell this 
to Azmat and Zaid?
[1911.42] Sister, I thought she would have corrected
herself after facing such a huge fraud.
[1916.95] But she has gotten even bolder that before.
[1921.22] No, Amber, she hasn't 
become bold but stubborn.
[1927.27] Brother Azmat was right 
about getting her married then.
[1931.11] At least we wouldn't have to see this day.
[1934.15] No, Amber, I have no doubts. 
 She would have run off even after marriage.
[1940.41] She is on a mission to humiliate us.
[1944.05] What am I going to do, tell me?
[1946.18] I think we should wait a little.
[1948.81] Just stay composed. Maybe she 
has gone somewhere new for some work.
[1953.89] Amber, if she doesn't return this time,
then we won't go looking for her either.
[1959.85] To hell with her.
[1961.83] Don't say like that.
[1963.22] Just pray that the way she left,
she gets back the same may.
[1966.16] If she won't come then...
[1971.56] Where have you been?
[1973.48] Do you have any idea how worried I was?
[1976.48] What's wrong, mama, 
why are you getting so hyped up?
[1978.36] I went to do something.
[1979.48] It's not your dad's or my fault. 
You yourself are responsible for all this.
[1984.84] We were so scared because of you.
[1986.74] You are creating such a scene 
as if I had run off from home...
[1991.98] Of course, running off 
from home is so easy for you.
[1998.84] Are you preparing 
to do something more than that?
[2003.60] But I won't let you do anything stupid now.
[2009.60] Your dad won't do that to you 
what I am going to do with you.
[2013.84] Enough, mama. One should learn 
exaggerating things from you.
[2018.20] You guys are on my nerves. 
What crime have I committed?
[2021.80] Millions of people run off fro their homes.
[2024.30] Nosheen.
[2030.10] Do you have any idea 
what a huge steep you took?
[2037.01] -What have you done, do you...
-No, no,
[2040.83] Let her insult me.
[2044.39] She is doing it in
front of you today,
[2046.72] tomorrow the whole
world is going to watch it.
[2049.36] Mama, stop overacting.
[2053.61] You really act up a lot in front of auntie.
[2060.25] Anyways, tell me when am I going back home?
[2062.96] -You aren't going back.
-What do you mean by that?
[2066.61] I am going back home with you right now.
[2068.55] As soon as you'll enter the house,
your dad is going to break your legs.
[2072.83] Then do something, Mama. 
I can't stay here anymore.
[2093.26] Why did I get unwanted
[2097.84] Nobody knows that
[2102.49] Why did I get unwanted
[2107.06] Nobody knows that
[2111.86] Sister, whatever Nosheen 
has done, it's her mistake.
[2117.64] If I am trying to get her
back to this house,
[2120.38]  it's because I want the environment
of this house get better.
[2124.20] I know everything.
[2125.58] There must be some hidden interest
of yours to bring Nosheen back home.
[2128.85] You are doing all this 
to look good in front of Azmat.
[2132.76] I know everything.
[2138.01] I love you, Zoya.
[2140.80] I love you too, Zaid.
[2152.76] You must be having so much fun
[2154.71] by looking at all this situation.
[2157.88] You must be enjoying a lot.
[2161.31] Go ahead, enjoy.
[2162.74] But I'm going to snatch all this happiness 
away from you real soon.
