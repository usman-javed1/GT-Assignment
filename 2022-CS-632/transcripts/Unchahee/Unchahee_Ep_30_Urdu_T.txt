[0.00] From flowers and from buds
[4.57] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.16] When I saw you
[14.32] I learned to chirp from you
[19.07] Oh, hello! What a surprise!
[23.42] Where have you been, Zoya?
I've been waiting for you for so long.
[31.37] Nosheen, what are you doing here?
[33.88] Faiq I wanted to talk to you about something
important that's why I had to come.
[38.59] Try to resolve your own problems.
[43.03] I don't know what is going to happen
to you both when I'll move to my in laws.
[46.43] We'll wait for you to visit so that
we can place our case in your court.
[50.52] You have made your dresses for your
brother's wedding with so much difficulty.
[54.20] Why haven't you made
any dresses for Aima's wedding?
[58.56] Let's see if this wedding
takes place or not.
[64.98] I guess, whatever happened
shouldn't have happened.
[68.16] Yeah we both got a little over emotional.
[73.52] Never mind, our issues
are sorted out now, aren't they?
[78.38] Right.
[80.08] By the way tell me about your shoot. What's
the brand, where's the shoot gonna happen?
[84.95] Oh, yeah, I forgot to tell you that?
[87.86] It's a multi-national food company,
it's their shoot.
[91.23] And for that I need to go to Dubai.
[94.01] Zoya, youâ€™re going to Dubai
and you didn't even tell me?
[97.68] How could have I told you?
You didn't give me a chance to tell you.
[101.81] I came home and you started
venting your anger out on me.
[104.93] But you could have told me
before you were leaving.
[108.83] -You know , Zaid, why didn't I share it with you?
-Why?
[114.31] Because I am scared
that I would have to take decisions
[117.14] about my own career with
someone else's permission.
[120.80] But, Zoya, I'm not someone else,
I'm going to be your husband.
[124.03] And what are you scared of?
[125.95] Nothing, I'm just scared that if I
get used to ask for permissions
[130.59] my career might suffer.
[133.09] Zoya, you know
that I am serious about your passion.
[139.08] I would never let your career suffer.
[141.39] And I'm not saying that you
should get permission from me,
[143.59]  it's just that you can inform me about it.
[148.63] I mean we should know
about each other's lives, don't we?
[151.57] You're right, Zaid. I should have told you.
[154.30] But I have signed the contract now,
and I'm going to go to Dubai.
[159.16] Okay, listen, I was just thinking
if you could tell dad too before leaving.
[166.78] Zaid, the way I am, I can't do all this.
[170.26] It's my personal life
and it's my own decision.
[174.29] Yeah, but he is the elder of the house,
I think you should share it once with him too.
[178.57] And what if he has any objection?
[180.60] No, I don't think he is going
to have any objection.
[185.48] It's just that he'll feel respected,
he'll fell good.
[188.03] And you have shared it
with auntie too, haven't you?
[190.93] Of course I sat and talked to her.
I share everything with her.
[195.56] Then do it with dad too.
I mean for my sake, Zoya, please.
[199.68] He's the eldest in the house.
[201.60] Okay, Zaid, I'll talk to him.
[204.73] Thank you, means a lot.
[214.31] Sister Nimra, there was no need
of this formality.
[217.62] You didn't need to do all this shopping,
all this stuff, these clothes.
[222.34] It's a joyous event
and it should be celebrated like that.
[227.06] Besides, I wish that
nothing lacks for Aima.
[233.87] None of her desire
shouldn't be left unfulfilled.
[238.25] Shabana, wasn't our Aima looking
so beautiful in that dress?
[241.53] Yeah.
[244.07] She was looking gorgeous.
[248.03] But sister Nimra,
your choice is amazing too.
[254.01] To tell you the truth
[256.75] I'm really happy for Aima.
[261.31] I know, and I'm very happy too.
[267.30] I wanted to talk to you
about something since a few days.
[276.22] I don't know if you'll agree to it or not.
[280.69] Tell me what is it?
[284.41] Shabana, I'm already telling you,
please don't mind.
[289.44] And never doubt my intentions.
[292.83] Just consider it a little wish that I have.
[296.40] Just talk to me,
[298.52] you can say anything to me,
I will never mind.
[302.84] And I hope that after
listening to what I have to say,
[305.90] you are going to give me
a positive response.
[309.36] Oh come on, now tell me what it is.
[313.04] I'm wondering what is it
that you want to say?
[317.79] Actually, Shabana, I want
that after Aima's marriage
[324.71] you move here too.
[329.37] I really want this.
[331.90] And you know, Faiq wants that too.
[337.84] Sister,
[342.94] Actually, this isn't possible.
[347.12] Why, Shabana? What's wrong with that?
[349.68] I'm your husband's sister.
[354.75] Consider me as your real sister.
[359.43] Look, if you'll move here
we will live in peace.
[362.81] And when you'll see Aima living happily,
yourself, you'll be content.
[367.73] That's your and Faiq's greatness.
[373.54] I'm happy that you have thought
about me so generously.
[379.51] But, may God bless my brother.
[384.18] I'm content at his place.
[390.81] He for me and I for him
are a source of peace in that house.
[398.68] And in my opinion
[402.82] brother would also never want
that when he is there
[407.19] I should live in your house instead of his.
[412.64] Look, Shabana, eventually
it will be your decision.
[417.31] But I would really want you to agree to it.
[424.18] That's your love for me.
[428.57] That's why I'm saying, move here,
we'll live together.
[432.59] And our love is going to increase too.
[435.98] Yeah.
[438.95] Okay, I'll talk to brother
and will let you know then.
[444.66] -Try your best.
-Sure.
[447.31] Anyway, did you see the colors?
[458.63] -Do you want to talk about something?
-Yeah.
[464.44] Uncle, I'd like to take your permission,
[472.26] I like it Zoya that you asked
for my permission.
[479.62] You are the eldest of the house.
[482.37] And had dad been alive today
[487.24] then I would have asked
for his permission too.
[494.85] You're right.
[498.40] If you want to follow your passion
then you have my permission.
[505.93] -Thank you, uncle.
-Welcome.
[513.86] But I'd like to give you an advice.
[518.92] Sure, go ahead.
[520.23] You are getting married.
[525.11] And you know well that after getting
married the responsibilities increase.
[530.97] I'll be happy if you keep your focus on your
responsibilities more than your hobbies.
[539.54] Now, please, I don't mean it at all
that you should limit yourself to it.
[546.20] Passion and enjoyment is one thing,
[548.91] but one's real focus should be
on one's home and married life.
[554.73] Yes, all right.
[562.80] Did you have tea or anything?
[565.16] -No, would you like to have some?
-Yes, please.
[572.17] Why isn't Faiq picking up?
[579.83] -Hello.
-What the hell is wrong with you?
[582.98] Why do you keep calling me?
[585.61] Faiq, why weren't you picking up my call?
[588.48] Because I didn't want to.
And don't call me again like this.
[592.24] Faiq, please talk to me,
I have been missing you for so long.
[596.93] You know, I was with Aima.
What if she found out?
[601.59] I don't care whatever she thinks.
[604.26] But I care,
I've told you everything, clearly.
[607.57] I thought you must have understood by now,
but you are still stuck there.
[610.76] That's what I don't get,
Faiq why I can't find peace.
[617.46] I just know one thing, that I love you
[622.18] Nosheen, you're creating
a lot of problems for me.
[625.92] Try to understand,
what you want isn't possible.
[629.84] Faiq, please don't do this to me.
[633.06] I am not doing anything, Nosheen,
you are the one doing everything.
[636.60] -Okay, please just meet me once.
-No.
[640.56] Faiq, please I love you.
[642.55] I beg you, please meet me just once.
[645.43] Look, Nosheen, don't embarrass me
like this, please.
[649.80] -So, please, meet me then.
-Why shall I meet you?
[653.82] I have explained you everything,
why can't you understand me?
[663.49] Look, Nosheen, please don't cry.
[666.65] I'm heart broken, Faiq.
[668.76] Okay, just stop crying, please.
[672.41] Okay, then promise me
that you're going to meet me.
[678.35] Are we meeting then?
[680.49] Okay, I will see.
[695.54] But there is nothing as such between us.
[697.82] Don't lie, you know
that there is something.
[700.25] Now you aren't accepting
it, that's a different story.
[702.40] Really? What am I not accepting?
[704.73] That you love me but you're marrying Aima.
[709.71] Look, Nosheen...
[712.31] -Did you order anything?
-Yeah, I've ordered and for you too.
[717.63] Thank you.
[718.50] What was it that you couldn't
tell me over the phone?
[722.27] I have a solution for our problem.
[725.65] Which problem.
[727.08] The problem which is going on
between us, Faiq. I'm talking about that.
[731.68] But there is no problem between us.
[733.64] Don't lie. You know it that
there is something between us.
[736.92] But if you don't want to accept
then that's a different story.
[741.31] Really? And what am I not accepting?
[744.05] That you love me but you are marrying Aima.
[748.10] Look Nosheen, all this is going to create
even more problems for us.
[752.35] So, it's better
that we don't talk about it.
[755.05] -But why, Faiq?
-Because there is no solution to this problem.
[760.06] When there is a will there is a way.
And if you'll ask me, I have a solution.
[764.25] Okay, what is it? And please don't
give any solution which I can't accept.
[769.97] Such as?
[773.90] Anything by which my mother
gets angry. I can't hurt her.
[780.15] Now tell me what it is.
[783.59] Faiq, I think that we should elope.
[793.29] We don't have any other option than this.
[797.00] What do you think, will our families agree?
[802.91] Neither your mom, nor my dad.
[804.91] And Aima is going to create
such a scene
[807.28] that after that I don't know what
dad and brother are going to do to me.
[813.67] Look, this is the only option we have.
Let's get our marriage solemnized.
[820.34] Our families will be mad at us
for a little time but eventually they will agree.
[826.21] No, Nosheen, this isn't possible. I can't hurt mom.
[831.14] Faiq, are you a school going kid that you
need your mom's permission for everything?
[836.07] Be a man, take your own decisions.
[839.80] I don't know what to tell you.
[844.15] Give me a minute.
I need to use the washroom.
[847.50] Excuse me.
[872.26] Thank you, all right.
[877.23] What a pleasant surprise, you here?
[880.31] Yeah, I had a meeting with my client
that's why I came here.
[884.81] -I thought you came with Aima.
-Aima? No I'm alone.
[889.48] Actually, I'm here with Zoya.
She is leaving for Dubai.
[891.82] So, I thought of having lunch together.
[894.25] Oh, by the way, when you
get free then feel free to join us.
[897.86] Yeah, sure.
[908.69] Amber, it's like you've just vanished.
You don't call, you don't visit.
[913.78] I have been busy lately.
[915.80] Office work and then wedding preparations.
[919.38] Zoya doesn't take any interest in all this.
[921.49] Yeah, that's true, I thought
you are angry at what Azmat said.
[926.51] Yes, you are right.
[928.62] After all he said something
[931.66] that it's valid for me to get angry.
[934.02] Am I wrong?
[936.32] -Yes, you're right.
-Well, you can see yourself.
[941.86] I just don't understand,
what is wrong with brother Azmat?
[945.07] Her daughter in law
is going to be someone else
[946.85] but all his favors
are for someone else.
[950.48] He will ignore Zoya
and take Aima to his office with him.
[954.71] Why doesn't he understand that
Aima belongs to some other house.
[958.78] That's totally unfair with my daughter.
[961.21] Don't worry, I'll talk to Azmat.
[964.02] With due apologies, I don't think
he pays any heed to what you say.
[971.05] He does what he wants, his own will.
[974.46] -Don't worry, Amber.
-How can I not worry?
[978.07] I see my daughter's future insecure.
[981.30] What sort of insecurity?
[982.92] Well, the way your husband
is being unfair and doing his own will.
[987.14] He doesn't even like his own children, why
would he think about his daughter in law?
[990.97] It's not like that, Amber,
you are overreacting.
[993.73] What's wrong in it?
Hasn't brother Azmat disowned Hammad?
[998.32] Hasn't he kept any contact with Nosheen?
[1000.54] Tell me, where am I wrong here?
[1002.58] And if tomorrow he dislikes
anything done by Zaid,
[1004.61]  he is going to throw him out as well,
[1005.95] and who is going to suffer? My daughter.
[1009.20] No, Amber, Zaid is his favorite child.
[1015.20] You'll see.
You can expect anything from him.
[1019.68] If he dislikes anything done by Zaid,
he is going to disown Zaid
[1024.04] and give all his property to Aima.
[1029.45] I just don't get it, I have seen
such a guy for the first time in my life
[1033.55] Who thinks more about
someone else's child than his own children.
[1037.11] What is it that Aima does
which your children haven't done?
[1041.44] Amber, the thing is he feels pity
for her more than love.
[1046.65] Because she is an orphan.
[1047.88] Otherwise he actually loves his children.
[1052.86] Please excuse me, but I can't digest
what is going on in front of my eyes.
[1058.47] You might be used to tolerate
him being unfair to you kids,
[1062.06] but I won't tolerate
any injustice to my child.
[1065.65] If I see anything like that then...
[1067.25] What are you talking
about, Amber? I'm her aunt,
[1069.72] I won't let anything wrong
happen to her in this house.
[1072.94] Yeah, I kept quiet considering it earlier.
[1076.89] But after looking the situation
in your home now, I had to speak up.
[1083.40] Look, I want to make it clear to you.
[1087.11] If my daughter is deprived of her rights
in this house then I won't stay quiet.
[1093.85] I'm not such an insignificant woman
[1095.88] that even if something wrong
is being done to my daughter in her in laws
[1098.45] and don't say anything.
[1099.87] I know very well how to chide everyone,
and you know that very well.
[1105.08] Trust me , Amber,
have faith in me I'm your sister.
[1109.37] Right now I'm not your sister
but the mother of your daughter in law.
[1113.72] You must understand this clearly
and make others understand that too.
[1117.35] If anybody is unfair
to my daughter or mistreats her then I...
[1123.04] I won't spare him,
be it an elder or someone young.
[1130.87] -Did you see? Nosheen was here.
-Nosheen?
[1136.27] With whom?
[1137.50] No idea, she just left.
[1142.25] Are you sure it was Nosheen?
[1144.19] Yeah, I'm 100% sure.
[1146.20] I looked closely, it was Nosheen.
[1149.07] She just got up and went,
and she was alone.
[1155.10] Yeah, actually I had a meeting
with a client that's why I came here.
[1159.42] I thought you came with Aima.
[1164.16] By the way, what were you doing there?
[1167.07] I just went to ask the manager
if they accept credit cards or not.
[1172.18] You did the right thing, or else you
would have had to wash dishes after lunch
[1176.67] and I would have had to take
a cab to reach the airport.
[1179.83] Very funny.
[1182.96] Oh by the way, guess who I met.
[1185.47] -Who?
-Faiq.
[1187.53] Oh, that's surprising.
It's such a small world.
[1192.34] -Was Aima with him too?
-No, he said he was here for a meeting.
[1197.18] -Oh, okay.
-But I've told him
[1199.33] if he gets free early he should feel free
to join us. If that's okay with you.
[1203.16] Yeah, it's totally fine.
You did the right thing to tell him.
[1207.57] If he is here we could have a chat.
[1210.28] Aima is going
to be really happy too if I'll tell her.
[1215.84] By the way, I don't see him,
where is he sitting?
[1220.25] He must be here somewhere,
may be inside.
[1223.64] Don't see him, I think he has left too.
[1228.45] What can I say. Anyway,
tell me what did you order?
[1231.75] I ordered butter chicken.
[1243.19] Okay, listen, please wait in the car,
I'll just be there in a minute.
[1251.71] Excuse me, this gentleman who was here
a while ago, in the camel color jacket,
[1257.24] -Who sir?
-The one I was talking to right here.
[1261.54] -Oh , yes, yes.
-Who was he with?
[1264.09] He came with a lady.
[1266.22] So, he had to leave due to an emergency.
[1270.70] Emergency.
[1273.73] Sir, he canceled his order as well.
[1289.97] Come, Shabana, come.
[1291.90] -Your tea.
-Thank you. I was just thinking about you.
[1298.78] Really? But you were reading.
[1301.61] So can't anyone think
about anybody while reading?
[1308.25] One thing is for sure, nobody can
make tea like you do in this house.
[1316.05] What's up? What are you thinking about?
[1323.60] Actually,
[1326.42] brother,
[1329.57] I was at sister Nimra's house when she
[1335.04] expressed her wish to me.
[1343.12] What kind of wish?
[1348.89] Look, brother,
[1354.32] I tried to say no but
after she insisted too much...
[1362.20] I've told her that I'll let her know
after asking brother.
[1369.03] Carry on, I'm listening.
[1370.88] Brother, sister Nimra wants that...
[1376.06] I...
[1380.21] go to her place.
[1382.58] Well, go then, when do you want to go?
[1385.82] No...
[1388.91] brother, she means...
[1395.86] that after Aima gets married
[1400.91] I move to her place permanently.
[1409.64] Has anybody said anything
to you in this house?
[1412.30] No, it's nothing like that.
[1415.11] Then did you mind anything I said?
[1417.50] Brother, I have no complains here.
[1421.90] and then...
[1427.25] you've kept me here with so much love.
[1433.39] You have taken care of me
more than I could imagine.
[1439.89] I have no complains living here.
[1442.63] -I'm happy and content.
-Then?
[1446.46] Initially I declined
sister Nimra's suggestion too.
[1452.10] But now I'm thinking that
the situation here at home is changing.
[1458.09] What do you mean?
[1460.09] Look, brother, Zaid is getting married.
[1465.32] Your daughter in law is coming
to the house by the grace of God.
[1469.40] And tomorrow they
are going to have a family here.
[1476.77] Brother, I don't want that because of me
[1482.63] someone's life is disturbed.
[1486.32] Look, Shabana, I know that a lot of hurtful
things are said to you in this house
[1490.70] which you don't mention to me at all.
[1496.52] But know that for sure
that I am your guardian.
[1502.93] You might be a burden for someone else,
but for me you are my only sister.
[1509.45] Your only shelter is this house.
[1512.07] Until I'm alive,
you won't go anywhere from here.
[1520.83] Okay, brother, sure.
[1526.38] You got my tea cold.
[1530.61] -I'll make some again for you.
-Yeah.
[1548.99] Nosheen, you should be thankful 
that God saved us.
[1552.28] -Why?
-What do you mean why?
[1554.58] Aren't you scared? 
What if Zaid saw us together?
[1557.97] So what if he saw us? 
Why are you so scared all the time?
[1563.48] Look, my fear is valid.
[1566.42] If Zaid had seen us together 
there would have been a chaos.
[1571.56] And look, I'm committed to Aima.
[1574.76] What would have I told him, 
who was with me, why were you with me?
[1579.79] Had it been some unknown girl 
I would have said that she's an old friend.
[1582.96] So can there be old friends only? 
Not new ones?
[1586.15] And I'm your friend.
[1589.34] And even if had seen us, 
it's not a big issues.
[1593.11] I would have told him.
[1594.73] He goes out with Aima all the time too.
[1597.67] And Aima is committed with you, isn't she?
[1601.15] You didn't need to tell me that.
[1603.46] And I don't care about Aima's activities.
[1606.56] Why? you should know about Aima. 
All she has to do is with Zaid only.
[1611.59] I just don't understand 
what is she going to do after marriage.
[1615.15] How is she going to live without Zaid?
[1617.73] Why do you say all these things 
to me again and again?
[1620.06] Look it doesn't make any difference to me. 
Everyone has a a past.
[1625.57] This means you have a past as well.
[1631.58] Did you also have an affair?
[1635.59] Just one?
[1638.46] Means multiple times? Love affairs?
[1642.46] Yeah, you can say that.
[1645.36] Faiq, look, just listen to me.
[1650.40] Please listen to me and marry me.
[1653.30] I promise everything
is going to be all right.
[1657.03] Look, Nosheen,
[1659.61] I have fallen in love with you too.
[1664.84] I enjoy your company.
I start missing you if you aren't with me.
[1672.30] But,  can't do this.
[1675.97] I don't have the courage to elope with you.
[1678.75] -We can do it, Faiq.
-It's too late.
[1683.36] I can't go against mom's will.
[1711.99] -Mama.
-Yeah?
[1715.46] Where did Nosheen go today?
[1717.73] When?
[1720.65] Today.
[1721.68] Where else would she go. She might
have gone to college before I got up.
[1726.11] She should have been in college
but I saw her somewhere else.
[1730.02] I don't get you, what are you saying?
[1732.88] I saw Nosheen at the restaurant today.
[1735.07] Are you aware of that?
[1736.49] No, who was she with?
[1739.24] You should know that.
[1740.96] She must have been with a friend.
[1742.98] Which friend?
[1744.43] I don't know about that.
[1746.70] What sort of an answer is this?
[1748.23] Even after so much has happened 
you are still not bothered?
[1750.86] You should be aware of each 
and every moment of hers.
[1753.53] What's wrong if she has gone
to the restaurant for a while?
[1758.04] Mama, how can you be 
so careless when it come to her?
[1761.00] Look, Zaid, why are you always after her?
[1765.42] I agree that she has committed a mistake.
Are we going to doubt her all her life?
[1769.60] And why do you keep tracking 
what she is up to?
[1772.81] Look, if she is even trying
to correct and changer herself
[1777.54] so she will change her mind 
by all this questioning and interrogation.
[1781.31] Mama, I'm his elder brother. 
I am entitled to know about her activities.
[1785.63] Zaid, if you like to be
his big brother,
[1788.37] then just sit with her, talk
to her and discuss with her.
[1792.46] I'll treat her well 
when she becomes worth it.
[1795.56] But right now, something else is going on.
[1799.72] -Do you have any idea who she went with?
-No.
[1803.05] Why? Didn't she find
it important to tell you ?
[1805.68] Don't you go to several places 
without telling me.
[1808.34] There is a lot of difference
between these do things, mama
[1810.66] I know the world.
[1815.68] Besides, I'm not stopping her 
from going anywhere.
[1818.64] She can sure go but 
at least inform you about it.
[1820.80] All right, I'll ask her when she returns.
[1824.01] Mama, just look at the time, 
she is still not home.
[1826.99] Please be serious.
[1829.61] Before something new happens.
[1833.31] Okay, wait, I have to talk to you. 
Why are you leaving like that?
[1838.89] -Go ahead.
-I have invited Hammad at the wedding.
[1843.32] Did you ask dad?
[1844.60] I won't take permission 
for everything from your dad.
[1847.21] Hammad is my son and it's an even of
our home. Why shouldn't he be part of it?
[1850.63] That's okay mama, 
but the way he misbehaved and left home
[1854.83] I don't think dad would like it.
[1856.28] He hasn't even apologized for his mistake.
[1858.72] What is it that your dad likes about us?
The most he can do is get angry.
[1862.04] I'll take his scolding.
[1863.70] Just do one thing. Tell your dad 
that you invited him when he arrives.
[1870.06] Mom...
[1872.07] Please don't say no now. You are my son, 
can't you do even this for your mom?
[1888.48] Is everything all right?
[1890.21] Yeah, everything is fine.
[1892.52] He must be busy with his business.
[1894.96] I'm sure he'll call me when he is free.
[1898.47] Don't you have any manners? 
Why are you checking my phone?
[1901.88] Why is Faiq sending you messages?
[1903.85] Mind your own business.
[1905.57] Nosheen I'm your elder brother, 
I have the right to know.
[1909.11] Aima, I think you 
are hiding something from me.
[1911.80] Why would I hide anything from you?
[1913.81] I have noticed that you have been
very disturbed through out the wedding.
[1917.79] And I didn't find it normal.
[1920.14] What's wrong with you?
[1922.79] Nothing.
[1925.01] Zaid, look at her eyes.
