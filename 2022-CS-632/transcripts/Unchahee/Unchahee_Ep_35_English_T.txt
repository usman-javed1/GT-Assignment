[0.00] From flowers and from buds
[4.54] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.13] When I saw you
[14.07] I learned how to chirp from you
[18.90] Mother, Nosheen isn't that type of a girl.
[21.26] You are thinking wrong of her.
[22.83] You don't need to tell me
 what kind of a girl she is.
[25.56] I know her very well.
[29.86] She is a very clever and cunning girl,
[33.10] whom I can never respect.
[35.83] Aima,
[38.12] everyone is blaming me.
[40.19] I haven't committed any sin either, Dad,
[43.09] but I am being judged as well.
[44.95] If you will get angry with me too,
where am I going to go?
[48.75] You are the only one who understands me.
[51.06] You are standing here with so much
confidence after disgracing yourself.
[55.45] Don't forget that you
are present in my home.
[59.98] She is your elder.
[62.03] She may be an elder in her house.
[65.06] All her tantrums are because you
have given her so much leverage.
[84.81] Zoya,
[87.88] what have you done to yourself?
[90.90] You know I can't watch you like this.
[94.17] Mom, Zaid told me that he loves me.
[98.66] And not just once, he said it many times.
[101.13] -Zoya, why are you...
-Why did he do this?
[105.39] And Aima, she was my best friend.
[110.19] Even then she deceived me.
[112.88] Get hold of yourself dear.
Don't cry like that.
[121.28] Mom I don't want to
live like this, I just don't.
[126.95] What are you talking
about? May your enemies die.
[130.47] And look, you aren't
going to cry anymore, okay?
[133.43] You won't cry at all. 
You are my strong daughter.
[137.19] Those who brought you to
this condition are going to cry,
[139.65]  they will cry all their lives.
[142.16] No, nothing can be done now.
[148.30] Why not dear?
[151.23] We will take revenge from them.
[155.22] What are you going to do? How
are you going to take revenge?
[159.93] I will file a case on them.
[163.30] I will drag all them to court.
[165.82] Why? They both have married
with each other's consent,
[171.41] is everything going to change
because of your case?
[174.74] Is everything going to
be like it was before?
[178.36] Tell me?
[180.01] No, right?
[182.46] They leave it, nothing is going
to make any difference to me now.
[188.24] Now you should accept
the reality as well that
[193.42] Aima is now Zaid's wife.
[196.70] No, Zoya, how can you give up so easily.
[201.27] Because there is no hope left.
[206.76] They did what they had to do.
[212.76] But no, I won't give up.
[217.69] I am going to destroy everyone's peace.
[234.74] Dad I have called Zoya but
her number is switched off.
[238.30] He is not at Zoya's place I have found
out. He left her place in the morning.
[242.53] Then where is he since morning?
[246.27] Don't know if he has eaten or not.
[249.95] I'm really worried, Dad. God forbid
there might be some emergency with him.
[254.93] Please call his university friends.
Ask them about his whereabouts.
[259.35] I don't feel good.
[260.73] Okay fine, send me friends'
numbers, I'll message them.
[265.30] -Zaid!
-Zaid.
[268.73] Where have you been, Zaid?
[271.19] Zaid, have you eaten anything? 
Are you all right?
[274.68] Where were you?
I was so worried...
[281.43] Dad, what's wrong with him? 
Why isn't he saying anything?
[284.79] He'll be fine, don't worry.
[286.46] -Please talk to him, ask him what's wrong.
-I'll go and see, you sit down.
[323.37] Mom, may I sit here?
[329.39] Are you feeling okay?
[333.56] -Yeah, I'm fine.
-Why didn't you come to have dinner with us?
[340.87] You ate earlier, right?
[343.08] If you know it why are you asking then?
[346.27] I was just confirming.
[349.71] I was thinking that from tomorrow, me and
Faiq are going to eat when you are eating.
[353.78] No need for that. You can eat whenever
you like.  No need to worry about me.
[359.65] What do you mean? 
Why shouldn't we worry?
[363.62] You know, there is
no fun in having food
[365.58] until some elder of the house
accompanies you.
[367.23] And Faiq hasn't eaten properly either.
[372.93] Faiq was telling me that you
like strawberry ice cream a lot.
[376.96] I have made some for you,
with my own hands, please come.
[381.39] Nosheen, stop making these efforts.
[384.84] I didn't get you, Mom?
[386.54] Just take care of your husband.
Keep him happy that's enough for me.
[390.94] Mom, whatever you think, but I won't
let any chance to serve you get away.
[396.24] And I will prove myself
to be your daughter.
[400.34] By the way, you should be thankful that
Aima didn't become your daughter in law.
[407.14] Because if she had become
your daughter in law
[409.30] she would have started fighting
with you within a few days.
[412.12] Nosheen, don't you understand
anything in the first time?
[417.72] I have told you many times that 
I don't need you to know about Aima.
[422.96] I know you and her very well.
[429.18] Go inside, it's too late, go sleep.
[456.26] Fine.
[458.56] Absolutely fine.
[462.26] Don;t worry about your fee Shanawaz.
[465.01] Just make such a case on these
father and son that they get ridiculed.
[469.42] Don't you worry, if Zoya testifies
against the allegations on them
[472.71]  then we may get them arrested too.
[475.19] It's necessary for
them to visit the lockup.
[482.40] -Yeah, Mom, you called me?
-Yeah, come here.
[487.63] Meet him, my lawyer, Mr. Shanawaz.
[493.01] I'm filing a case on Zaid.
[495.29] He is going to come back to his senses
after spending some time in the lock up.
[500.40] What case?
[502.00] Well, he has given you mental
torture right after marriage
[506.45]  and married again without your consent.
[509.66] 00:30:46,127 --> 00:30:51,675
Just read it, sign it and after that
[516.59] sign here as well.
[520.05] Here.
[526.88] What is this?
[531.89] These are your divorce papers.
[533.97] Doesn't matter if Zaid divorces Aima
[536.84] but you won't stay married to him now.
[540.62] Come on, stop thinking and sign it.
[547.62] Sign it, Zoya.
[552.59] I can't.
[558.83] Zoya!
[561.85] Look, it's very important that she is ready
for it, or else we will have a weak case.
[568.15] Don't worry about her,
Shanawaz, I'll convince her.
[571.80] Just carry on with your working.
[586.88] -So are you ready?
-Just give me five minutes, doing last touch up.
[592.84] That's surprising, you said
that twenty minutes ago too.
[597.77] Ha ha ha, you're so funny Zaid.
[602.31] That I am.
[604.22] By the way, Zoya, I wonder
[606.13] why girls spend so much time
in front of the mirror getting ready,
[609.24] just to hear from others that you
look so different today?
[613.76] Zaid, I don;t like these
typical kind of jokes by men.
[617.23] And you know very well
how much I hate them.
[621.59] Specially those related to wives.
[623.91] Okay, it's decided, from now on no such
typical jokes, specially related to wives.
[629.71] Yeah, as if you are that obedient.
[632.88] Do you have any doubts?
[634.65] I'm telling you, Zoya, I will
be a very obedient husband.
[637.64] Really? And when people will call you a
hen-pecked husband what are you going to do then?
[642.49] Well I'm going to feel
proud. I love you, Zoya.
[646.29] Besides, it's nice that
proudly I listen to my own wife,
[649.30] not like others who just
listen to others' wives.
[652.34] Don't even think about it, or else I am going
to do that to you that you will remember.
[657.07] I won't dare. Zoya. Let me
tell you I am too scared of you.
[664.04] You got the remote control
of my life in your hands.
[667.32] I can't even drink water without your consent.
[672.87] You are such a drama queen.
[674.92] I am trying to express
my loyalty to you
[676.71] and you think of it as a drama, 
what's going on.
[679.75] Shall we go now? 
Aren't you getting late now?
[684.51] Let's go.
[685.87] Oh, I forgot to put on perfume.
[688.63] No, no, put that one on, please.
[691.65] -Why?
-Put it on.
[694.86] -This?
-That's my favorite.
[697.77] It smells good.
[700.04] Come on.
[737.40] Zoya.
[742.03] What were you doing?
[745.41] Nothing.
[749.18] Were you trying to message Zaid?
[752.52] Why don't you understand that
that guy doesn't deserve you.
[756.99] And he has to pay for what he has done.
[761.41] And not just him but his whole family.
[769.05] I curse that moment when
you said yes to his proposal.
[776.98] I get angry at myself too why I
didn't stop you why didn't I explain you.
[781.93] I trusted him considering
him as my own blood.
[786.25] Mom,
[789.40] Mom, I was thinking that we
should at least hear Zaid once.
[795.45] Are you insane?
[799.16] -He has deceived you.
-Yeah, he has.
[803.86] But he may have some reason for it.
[808.04] He has compromised you.
[811.01] Whatever the reason may be,
he preferred that reason over you.
[817.20] And I won't let my daughter
become someone's second priority.
[820.94] -But, Mom.
-No ifs and buts.
[824.62] Do as I say.
[826.66] I have to send that boy to the lock up.
[831.28] What did they think? Did they
bring a girl from a beggar's family?
[837.46] That there would be no
one to support that girl?
[840.47] Mom, but he told me before getting married.
[843.08] He told you, not asked you.
[846.36] Whatever, how can we
prove that it's a crime?
[850.38] Besides, marrying someone isn't illegal.
[854.27] What can we prove and what not, 
just leave that to me.
[859.91] I am accusing him of such things that on
their basis he will get arrested for sure.
[868.57] You'll see then, Azmat Hussain's
pride is going to vanish.
[873.28] What accusations?
[874.98] The lawyer is going to tell you all the details.
[876.98]  You will just have to do what he says.
[880.13] Sign these papers.
[882.19] Except for doing a second marriage
Zaid has done nothing wrong with me.
[889.71] Are you going to accuse him falsely?
[892.85] He has tortured you mentally.
[895.41] He has married again right
after getting married to you.
[899.74] Isn't that enough?
[901.15] In return if we put some allegations
on him, what's wrong with that?
[907.20] And remember one thing, Zoya.
[910.19] Even if he begs and falls in your feet,
[915.83] I won't let you go with
him at any cost now.
[919.01] Mom, I know that you are very hurt.
[922.51] But I am not going to accuse Zaid
falsely, nor I am going to let you do it.
[928.01] -Zoya, you...
-Mom, I can understand
[932.36] and that doesn't mean at
all that I want to stay with him.
[937.24] Just leave these divorce
papers here. I'll sign them.
[958.98] I won't ask for your forgiveness.
[961.96] Because they both
haven't let me even able
[964.93] to give a justification
to ask for forgiveness.
[968.89] I haven't come here as
Faiq's mother, Shabana.
[972.62] Rather I am here as your
sister in law and Aima's auntie.
[979.61] I wish I had limited our
relationship to this only.
[985.92] If I had the slightest idea that my
child is going to deceive me like that
[990.34] then believe me I would
have never fixed this marriage.
[994.28] It all depends on fate, sister.
[1002.90] I have no complains from you.
[1005.87] How can this be, Shabana? I have hurt you.
[1012.94] I have shown you a
dream about a beautiful,
[1015.72] respectful life for your
daughter and then let you down.
[1020.24] Non, sister, you haven't let me down.
[1024.20] But I was the one who gave
you my word. I promised you.
[1028.45] As I said,
[1030.68] don't feel bad about it.
[1035.87] I have cleared my heart for everyone.
[1038.91] No, Shabana, even if you
forgive me, I can't forgive myself.
[1047.70] Greetings, auntie.
[1050.51] Greetings.
[1057.07] Aima, my dear, please forgive me.
[1061.48] Auntie, what are you doing?
[1066.29] You are embarrassing me.
[1068.57] And look, I have no complains with anybody.
[1075.25] I have accepted it as a part of my fate.
[1081.17] Dear, honestly I tries a lot
[1085.65] but I couldn't take a stand for you.
[1088.96] It's all right, auntie.
[1091.32] It was just bad timing.
[1095.92] We can't do anything about that.
[1100.52] This is your greatness  
that you are saying such a thing.
[1104.86] Otherwise had it been someone else she
wouldn't have wanted to even see my face.
[1111.50] But you guys have honored me.
[1114.71] You called me home, sat with me.
[1121.70] Please, auntie, it's nothing
like that. You are still my auntie.
[1129.18] Shabana,
[1131.64] to tell you the truth I
envy your upbringing.
[1136.34] I always used to say, and I still say it
[1141.09] she is one in a million.
[1145.14] Sister, it's not up to
me, it's my God's gift.
[1151.08] You are right, no doubt.
[1153.95] Sister,
[1158.14] what are you doing here right now?
[1160.53] Don't you have to prepare
for Faiq's wedding reception?
[1163.27] Yes, Shabana they are having
preparations for the wedding reception.
[1168.60] But I didn't find it
appropriate to join them.
[1172.13] Sister, you should have been there.
[1177.41] He is  your son.
[1179.14] No Shabana, he hasn't just hurt you guys,
[1183.25] he has hurt me a lot too.
[1186.56] And the step he has taken for his happiness
only he should celebrate that alone too.
[1193.78] No matter what happens, I will never
accept Faiq and Nosheen's marriage.
[1202.76] I will neither forgive Faiq nor
myself for what Faiq has done.
[1210.69] Auntie, why are you hurting yourself?
[1215.56] Because, Aima, I'm Faiq's
mother and I have brought him up.
[1221.98] And I am feeling really ashamed over it.
[1226.36] He made me realize how my upbringing was,
that I didn't prove to be a good mother.
[1233.69] Please, don't worry auntie.
[1292.72] -Oh, no, mama didn't even iron it.
-Hey, let me iron it.
[1297.21] No, Nosheen it's okay, I'll manage.
[1300.27] Faiq it's just a shirt, I'll do it.
[1302.84] It'll take just two minutes,
I'll do it, doesn't matter.
[1305.24] -I'll do it, Faiq...
-I told you...
[1319.69] Aima,
[1324.69] I had to get my shirt ironed, so Nosheen...
[1329.05] Yeah, I said I should iron it.
[1333.84] Auntie sent me for that.
[1337.02] Well, then Nosheen can iron it,
please come in we can talk here.
[1388.07] I have told you, I am not going
to interfere in your matters.
[1390.61]  Do whatever you like.
[1394.62] That's what I have come to tell you.
[1396.81] I am giving up, and going to talk to her.
[1400.08] -But only because of you.
-What?
[1403.35] Zaid go because of your sake.
[1407.21] Go for Zoya's sake, go for
the sake of your relationship.
[1411.44] And please stop fighting like kids and
try to sort out your issues yourselves.
[1418.02] -Why don't you say that to her?
-I have told that to her too
[1421.40] and I am telling that
to you too once again.
[1424.84] Please, please stop fighting.
[1427.34] Try to resolve your own problems.
[1431.73] I don't know what is going to happen
to you both when I will go to my in laws.
[1435.26] We will wait for you to come back so
that we can run our case in your court.
[1455.42] Zaid, I need to talk to you. 
Can we sit for a while and talk?
[1461.66] Please, Aima, I'm not in a
condition to talk right now.
[1466.26] But, Zaid...
[1469.69] It would be better if
we don't talk right now.
[1473.01] I am in such a situation
right now
[1475.49] that I'm hearing something else
and understanding something else.
[1478.87] Try to understand.
[1482.08] Are you feeling all right?
I'm worried about you.
[1486.91] Yes, I am fine. Don't worry about me.
[1492.53] Where are you going in such condition.
[1495.72] Aima, please, I have
told you to leave me alone.
[1509.66] Sir, someone left this for you.
[1512.84] -Who left it?
-I don't know, postman left it, said it's on your name.
[1532.91] What happened, Zaid?
[1536.49] Zaid, tell me what is it?
[1542.21] What happened, Zaid, at least tell me.
[1549.64] Zaid.
[1591.86] We are going to be in a relationship.
You know a life long relationship.
[1597.89] -Should I tell you the truth?
-Yeah, I want to know the truth.
[1602.98] And what if you don't like it?
[1622.75] If I say that I love you
and want to marry you,
[1631.71] what will be your response?
[1636.48] Tell me what is going to be your response?
[1640.08] Will you marry me?
[1707.50] It had no effect on his father.
[1710.09] He is still being stubborn,
but I won't spare him either.
[1715.76] -I'll show him.
-What?
[1717.36] What can you do, Mom?
[1719.11] Aima, at least someone needs to talk.
[1726.59] Look, it's not just him who got effected
[1729.83] you have been effected
with brother's decision too.
[1734.08] A huge gap has been created
between us after this incident.
[1738.70] I think that we should stay
away from each other for a while.
[1742.94] Aima is banking on me, you
have expectations from me too.
[1746.84] Auntie's health is dependent
on me, but what about me?
[1749.93] Does anybody care about me?
[1753.89] You want me to be happy
and smile and accept everything
[1758.17] as if nothing had happened?
