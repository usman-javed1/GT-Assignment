[0.00] From flowers and from buds
[4.57] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.16] When I saw you
[14.32] I learned to chirp from you
[18.63] I was thinking that from tomorrow, me and
Faiq are going to eat when you are eating.
[22.61] No need for that. You can eat whenever
you like.  No need to worry about me.
[28.24] What do you mean?
Why shouldn't we worry?
[32.23] You know, there is
no fun in having food
[34.18] until some elder of the house
accompanies you.
[36.02] And Faiq hasn't eaten properly either.
[39.28] I'm filing a case on Zaid.
[41.53] He is going to come back to his senses
after spending some time in the lock up.
[46.71] What case?
[48.37] Well, he has given you
mental torture right after
[52.78]  and married again without your consent.
[56.08] Just read it, sign it and after that
[62.84] sign here as well.
[66.38] Here.
[67.17] How can this be, Shabana? I have hurt you.
[72.05] I have shown you a
dream about a beautiful,
[75.00] respectful life for your
daughter and then let you down.
[79.31] No you haven't let me down.
[83.22] But I was the one who gave
you my word. I promised you.
[141.82] Aima, what happened? Everything all right?
[145.68] Zaid has gone somewhere.
[148.06] Where has Zaid gone?
And what is this in your hands?
[151.14] Where did Zaid go?
[153.55] Zoya has asked for a divorce from Zaid.
[160.80] Get hold of yourself, what's wrong?
[163.32] Nothing is wrong,
everything is going to be all right.
[165.98] All this is happening because of me.
[168.52] All this is just for the time being,
it's emotional, nothing is wrong.
[171.36] Tell me where is Zaid?
[173.56] -I don't know...
-He must have said something!
[176.04] He left without saying anything,
I don't know.
[179.58] Okay hold this, I'll just check.
[206.16] There is a limit to shamelessness.
[208.91] That boy's parents are hiding.
[212.12] They didn't even bother to visit here.
[216.33] -Mom, why would they come here?
-Why not?
[220.62] If a person does a mistake then
he is supposed to feel sorry for that.
[223.90] But here there is no sign of being sorry.
[227.79] What should I say to someone else
when my own sister doesn't care.
[233.22] The world is like that, Mom,
and I am aware of it now.
[237.62] You're right
[239.93] And Zaid, he tried just once.
[243.38] And after that he sent Aima here.
[247.09] I don't think that Zaid had sent him.
[250.50] And to tell you the truth all
of this was done by uncle.
[255.15] Aima and Zaid have nothing to do with it.
[260.33] For God's sake, Zoya,
stop taking their side.
[265.73] Mom, I'm not taking anyone's side.
[268.90] I'm just saying that this
step wasn't taken by Aima.
[272.50] Someone must have
compelled her to do so,
[275.27]  but this doesn't mean at
all that she is innocent.
[280.03] Zoya darling, try to understand me.
[284.11] That girl is very sharp and cunning.
[287.85] She kept fooling you for so long through
her simplicity. She has deceived you.
[294.71] And remember one thing, those who
appear simple are actually very clever.
[303.50] You are right.
[306.89] The problem is that
actually you are very simple.
[311.28] You are the same inside out.
[313.97] But that girl and her mother
are cunning and clever.
[317.96] They are giving you the impression
[320.00] that without you they are
mourning in their house,
[323.08] but the reality is something else,
I have seen it with my own eyes.
[328.54] It's like a fest going on there.
[330.84] It had no effect on his father.
[333.37] He is still being stubborn,
but I won't spare him either.
[339.15] -I'll show him.
-What?
[340.70] -I'll show him.
-What?
[343.02] Just wait and watch what I am going to do.
[364.38] Zoya, what's going on?
Where has everyone gone?
[370.04] I don't know, they have gone inside.
[372.05] I think auntie needs to talk to
them about something important.
[374.55] Okay, just don't worry. It must be
something, I don't know about it right now.
[379.48] Zoya, I'm really anxious about Faiq.
[386.70] I'm very worried.
[388.60] He must be here somewhere, just
don't worry. Your make up will spoil.
[393.98] How can I not worry, Zoya?
[396.79] Whatever it is, is related to my marriage.
[400.03] Just call Zaid and ask what is wrong.
[402.32] Call him, quickly.
[404.07] How can everyone leave like that?
[412.29] Dial once more.
[416.36] He is disconnecting.
[419.86] Zoya, the way auntie has called
everyone, I think it's bad news.
[425.71] And I'm worried about
mom, she is so weak-hearted.
[430.01] -I'm really worried.
-Calm down, why are you thinking so negatively?
[433.81] Everything is going to be fine.
[437.30] -Please call Zaid.
-Yeah, I'm calling. Relax, relax.
[456.61] Where were you gone?
[460.48] I went for some work.
[467.23] What did Zoya say?
[471.57] We all need time to accept this fact.
[475.98] In fact everyone will take time.
[480.46] -Wait. I have to talk to you.
-Sure, go ahead.
[489.81] Zaid is at home.
[493.04] Did you talk to him?
[494.72] No, I didn't go to him.
[497.40] Aima, at least someone
needs to talk to him.
[504.85] Look, it's not just him who got effected
[508.07] you have been effected
with brother's decision too.
[512.30] A huge gap has been created
between us after this incident.
[516.90] I think that we should stay
away from each other for a while.
[523.33] But don't worry, everything
is going to be fine.
[527.33] Right now, just let it be.
[531.32] No,
[533.47] it's better to bridge the gaps as  soon as possible.
[543.28] Dear, you are his wife.
[549.04] You have the right to talk to him.
[551.97] To tell him how you feel.
[557.13] Go and talk to him.
[559.81] He doesn't want to talk to me.
[562.82] -How can I...
-Aima,
[567.10] I've got a bad feeling.
[571.19] The thing I fear the most is that
[575.86] is he going to accept
you as his wife or not.
[579.11] Don't worry, mother.
[582.12] We both will have to accept the reality
that he is my husband and I'm his wife.
[591.35] Yeah.
[593.64] Yeah, dear.
[596.75] He should realize that.
[601.00] If he isn't acknowledging it
[603.97] then you should make him realize that.
[606.47] Yeah, don't worry, I'll talk to him.
[611.61] Okay, now get ready.
[613.88] Let's go to the doctor and get
your tests done as well, okay?
[618.14] Okay.
[638.60] Are you sleeping?
[640.86] -Oh, Dad. No , no please tell...
-I'll come later.
[643.63] No please, sit down, tell me what it is?
[646.63] I wanted to talk to you.
[650.70] Did you meet Zoya?
[654.56] Yeah, I went to her place.
[658.42] She must be angry.
[662.72] Shouldn't she be angry?
[665.93] What did she say then?
[667.52] I wish she would have said anything. Dad.
[669.50] At least I would have had a glance of her.
[674.26] She doesn't even want to see my face, Dad.
[676.96] She doesn't want to meet me.
Do you know what that means?
[679.73] Get hold of you self, Zaid.
Use your senses.
[686.39] Her wound is still fresh. I already
told you that this is a tough time for her.
[694.42] The decision you have
taken, stay firm on it.
[699.72] Until you are stable how will I know
that I have taken the right decision?
[707.17] Just think what your plan is. How are
you going to manage both your wives?
[711.31] Because they both have a right on
you, you have to give them their rights.
[716.72] Stay away all day long, hurting
yourself won't do any good.
[722.68] You have signed your
marriage contract,
[725.58] so now both these girls
are your responsibility.
[728.11] And this is not an impossible thing. It
happens, people handle them,
[731.76] fulfill their relationships.
[734.95] The truth is that I gave you this
responsibility just for the same reason.
[738.53] Because I knew that
you can fulfill them well.
[743.09] I have a lot of hopes from you, son.
[745.83] I am sure that you won't let me down.
[750.11] Are you listening to me?
[752.89] Yeah.
[755.33] Shabana was telling me that you
haven't gone to Aima after getting married.
[760.69] -No.
-Son, Aima is very worried, try to understand her feelings.
[768.50] If you have given her your
support then hold her hand.
[771.24] We have a lot of expectations from you.
[773.71] Dad, I am a human too. Please
consider me as a person too.
[777.85] Aima is banking on me, you
have expectations from me too.
[781.79] Auntie's health is dependent
on me, but what about me?
[784.86] Does anybody care about me?
[788.79] You want me to be happy
and smile and accept everything
[793.17] as if nothing had happened?
And it happens all around?
[798.63] Please, Dad, think about me as well. I
have some feelings, some emotions too.
[804.04] I'm not a machine.
[822.48] Dad, give me some time.
I'll try to make everything all right.
[883.80] Why do you guys take Aima along with you?
[890.49] What kind of a question is this?
[894.58] It's a very simple question.
[897.91] Why don't you guys go alone?
Why do you take her with you?
[902.05] Mom, if she comes with me what's
wrong with that? She is my friend.
[912.39] Zoya, what are you thinking
about? You breakfast is getting cold.
[916.97] Yeah, Mom, I'm eating.
[922.01] The notice has reached there, I confirmed.
[929.21] Nothing, Mom, I just feel burdened.
[934.43] I was thinking if we
are doing the right thing.
[937.55] It's 100% right.
[940.64] Whatever he has done, he deserved this.
[946.50] Trust me, whatever your mom
is doing is for your own good.
[954.34] But I want your support in all this.
[959.91] I know my daughter is very confident.
[965.99] She won't let anyone do wrong to her.
[969.03] She always tells the truth
and stands firm on her decisions.
[973.95] But where is that Zoya?
[981.31] I know that my daughter isn't that
weak that she breaks down so easily.
[990.03] You are very strong.
[992.59] And we have to stand firm on
the decision that we have made.
[998.72] Yeah, Mom.
[1000.32] I want my old Zoya
back who was full of life.
[1005.50] Fearless, bold, who used
to look at life positively.
[1012.82] You have to become the same Zoya.
[1015.38] Yeah, Mom.
[1017.79] Whatever had happened, just consider
it as a bad incident and forget it.
[1023.84] Just think that you made a
big mistake which you corrected.
[1027.76] And Zaid isn't the last option in this world.
[1034.93] You have to move forward in your life.
[1037.90] Believe me, after some time,
what you think is really difficult,
[1043.18] you are going to forget all that.
[1051.62] Come now, have your breakfast.
It's getting cold.
[1055.79] Yeah, I'm eating.
[1078.68] This guy never answers his phone.
[1086.75] Hello, Zaid, where are you?
[1089.58] -Hello, hello.
-Hello, Zaid?
[1093.04] -Hello.
-Hello, who is this?
[1095.39] Who are you, this is my son's cell phone.
Where is he?
[1098.93] His car met an accident,
and a guy is lying unconscious inside.
[1101.77] What? What are you saying?
[1103.54] That's my son. Is he badly hurt?
[1107.99] I can't tell you that right now.
[1109.51] We are shifting him
to the hospital, please reach there.
[1112.39] Which hospital are you taking him?
Please tell me.
[1115.90] Yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming. Oh. my God!
[1125.43] Faiq you are not bothered at all.
[1128.75] I didn't get you.
[1130.18] It was our wedding reception
yesterday and your mother didn't come.
[1132.73] Did you talk to her?
[1135.58] -No.
-Then talk to her.
[1138.12] She has done so wrong to us.
She humiliated us in front of everyone.
[1144.92] What can I say? I wanted to convince
her but she didn't want to come.
[1149.51] Faiq she has humiliated us.
[1152.04] This was her way of taking revenge.
[1155.00] That way I can say too that
[1156.58] your brother and dad have humiliated
me by not showing up at the reception.
[1160.99] Are you comparing?
[1163.66] I'm not comparing, I'm just saying
[1165.84] that if my mother didn't come
then your family wasn't there either.
[1169.02] Faiq, the girl's family is responsible for the
wedding event. And this was the reception.
[1176.68] And people only object when the host
of the event isn't present not the guests.
[1183.49] Your mother should have been
there, it was her responsibility.
[1186.71] She did very wrong to us.
[1189.06] Why don't you understand, Nosheen,
nobody is happy with what we have done.
[1193.96] So many people have been hurt.
[1195.69] Everybody is mad at us, and don't know
how long they are going to stay that way.
[1199.95] But till when, Faiq? 
There is a limit to everything.
[1204.27] I don't know, and besides
why are you saying it now?
[1209.13] You were even ready to
elope with me, now bear it.
[1212.58] We haven't committed a sin that
your mother is treating us like this.
[1216.47] Whatever we did was permissible.
[1220.89] At times people get hurt 
by permissible things too.
[1226.50] And we haven't hurt
just one but many people.
[1229.93] Faiq, it's important that we stay happy.
[1233.01] People never get happy.
[1238.71] And your mother should consider
the fact that who makes her son happy.
[1243.35] My happiness is important, Nosheen,
[1247.92] but mothers have some wishes too.
[1251.52] And my mother was really happy
when I was getting married to Aima.
[1255.32] Oh, but till when is your mother
going to keep taking Aima's name?
[1258.95] And wail on our marriage.
Her tantrums aren't getting over.
[1263.29] Is this the way to talk about my mother?
[1268.88] -No, I didn't mean it that way.
-What you meant is obvious by what you said.
[1278.12] Faiq, mom's disagreement hurts
me because I want to prove myself.
[1284.05] I want to serve her all the time.
Don't misinterpret my emotions Faiq.
[1290.75] Don't worry. Have a little patience.
[1296.76] I have a feeling that mom is going to
forgive is in a few days. Okay? Relax.
[1302.72] Yeah, I hope so too.
[1312.15] Hello, yeah Mama? What?
[1327.27] He has been given medicine so that
he keeps sleeping and his pain reduces.
[1330.60] I think we all should go now, get up.
[1332.78] No, I'm going to stay with
him. I'll take care of him.
[1335.88] Okay, be careful, he shouldn't wake up.
[1339.14] Aima, let em explain you
about his medicines, come.
[1362.79] Zaid,
[1365.42] Zaid, wake up, have some breakfast.
[1383.31] I was just checking your fever, so...
[1388.04] I have told you so many
times to stay away from me.
[1392.21] How can I leave you in this condition?
[1395.15] Dad has given me the
responsibility to take care of you.
[1398.84] I don't need anyone.
[1400.96] Whatever happened, what's going to happen
in future, I'm responsible for that myself.
[1403.95] Stop being so stubborn. 
Till when is this going to go on?
[1410.40] You have been like this since a week.
[1414.82] You should keep in mind that you aren't
just hurting yourself but all of us as well.
[1418.35] I haven't hurt anyone, Aima, nor
anybody needs to worry about me.
[1423.32] How can we not worry about you?
[1426.12] You are very important for us.
[1430.02] Do you have any idea in what
condition dad brought you home?
[1436.56] We all got so worried after
knowing about your accident.
[1441.26] What if anything happened to you, Zaid?
[1443.96] It would have been better, 
your lives would have been easier.
[1447.24] -Zaid!
-Please, I don't want to hear anything.
[1450.72] Leave me alone.
[1453.53] And no need to worry about me, I
don't want anyone to worry about me.
[1459.55] Please leave.
[1463.45] Okay, just have this glass of milk, I'll
give you your medicines then and leave.
[1468.87] Please.
[1512.56] Look what you have
done to my garden.
[1514.42] Go water the plants there too,
all of them are getting dried up.
[1518.76] Don't know what...
Wait a minute, you are back again?
[1524.58] Wasn't it enough for you
to get humiliated once?
[1528.74] Auntie, please let me meet Zoya.
[1531.92] What kind of a shameless girl are you?
[1534.40] Auntie, she is my friend, I have to...
[1536.75] She used to be your friend, now you have
become the second wife of her husband.
[1543.98] Try to understand this difference.
[1545.72] And who do you want to prove yourself
nice by visiting here again and again?
[1552.47] You are newly married, go and have fun.
[1555.92] Roam around with your husband.
[1558.60] Now that you have ruined my daughter's life.
[1563.22] What the hell do you want?
[1565.30] If you have so much love for Zoya,
why don't you get divorced from Zaid?
[1573.76] What's wrong? Out of words, are you?
[1576.97] You can't do it, do you?
[1580.57] Why do you want to meet Zoya then?
[1582.62] Auntie, please, I can't
share that with you.
[1587.33] Can I go meet Zoya?
[1592.06] Go ahead, meet her. Give it 
a try for sake of your satisfaction.
[1596.04] But listen to me carefully
that I will do what I have to do.
[1601.40] Understand? Now go.
[1612.51] Anyway, I came to know that Zaid
met an accident? How is he doing now?
[1617.26] What can I say, mom?
[1619.14] He is in a bad shape since few days.
[1621.83] Few days? But he had
an accident just today.
[1626.62] I will not use any of my rights 
even after being Zaid's wife.
[1633.26] I promise you that.
[1636.29] Please, just let me...
[1639.23] let me live in your house.
[1641.55] You are serving Zaid 
with a lot of devotion.
[1646.06] Yeah, he wasn't able to do his
tasks so I was just taking care of him.
[1651.81] You weren't here as well.
[1653.26] And you thought of making
the most of the opportunity, right?
[1657.23] I'm showing you these pictures so
that you think about our honeymoon.
[1661.53] Otherwise why would I show you 
someone else's pictures?
[1664.88] Okay, we will go but
it's not the right time.
