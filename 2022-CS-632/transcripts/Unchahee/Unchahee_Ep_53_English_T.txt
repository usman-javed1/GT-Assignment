[0.08] From flowers and from buds
[4.64] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.23] When I saw you
[14.17] I learned how to chirp from you
[19.60] Anyway, who is this friend?
[23.20] I have invited Sania.
[25.45] What?
[28.19] The same Sania whom you were taking
selfies with getting too close to her?
[31.42] What if he minds it when he finds out.
[34.52] What are you saying?
Which home? Whose son?
[41.17] What does he has to do with
the problems of this home?
[45.93] He has left this home, Zaid.
[47.72] Now you guys should
prepare yourself to run around.
[53.73] Sister, brother Azmat, you both
are going to be grand parents.
[68.34] Yes, my Zoya is expecting.
[79.94] Nosheen, why are you sitting here?
[83.63] Actually, auntie,
I'm feeling really  unwell.
[87.81] I just vomited too.
[90.92] -Vomit?
-Yeah, I think I've good food poisoning.
[96.03] Don't worry, you'll be fine.
[99.05] How am I going to be
fine just like that by myself?
[101.48] I'll have to take some medicine.
[103.94] Yes, you're right. It's important
to take you to the doctor.
[108.78] Auntie, I'm not feeling well
and Faiq has planned a dinner.
[114.86] -And I can't even stand properly.
-Just don't worry,
[118.58] I will handle everything for the dinner.
[120.98] No auntie, Faiq is going to feel so bad.
[124.42] He had asked me to help you.
[127.69] Nosheen, as I said, I'm going to handle
everything for the dinner and Faiq too.
[132.79] You just come with me and get a test done.
[135.88] Test? Which test?
[138.70] Test through which we can find out if you
have got food poisoning or something else.
[144.15] Okay then, I'll go change and we'll leave.
[148.64] Okay, fine.
[169.62] Mom, why did you need to do all this? 
Such a huge lie?
[173.84] This was needed, they
needed to have this shock.
[179.37] But that's not true. And you said that
you were taking the sweet for uncle.
[186.10] Yes, it's true that it isn't true.
[192.00] But only you and I know this. They
only know that you are pregnant.
[197.36] Mom, we are lying about such a big thing.
[203.16] And till when can we hide it?
[206.14] Oh, please, stop arguing
about truth and false right now.
[212.28] Everything is going to be fine.
[217.44] No, Mom, I can't carry on with
this drama, and in a few days
[219.18] everybody is going to
know about it as well.
[221.12] I can't do this.
[224.41] Relax, why are you panicking?
[227.85] Mom, tell me, how can I manage this drama?
[231.92] I have planned everything. 
Everything will be done.
[234.98] Mom, look, I can't do this.
[237.84] Let's do one thing, let's tell them
right now that we were mistaken,
[242.30] Please, Mom, lets end this right here.
[246.94] Keep quiet.
[252.70] You are talking so loudly,
what if someone hears you?
[254.91] All our plan is going to be wasted.
[256.75] Mom, this isn't a drama going
on, I can't tell this lie, I'm sorry.
[265.07] You are going to do it, 
and you have to do it.
[272.38] When you can't get
things done the right way
[274.01] you have to choose
the wrong way to do it.
[276.43] Mom, I don't understand why did you do it?
[280.26] Don't you want to move out of this house?
[282.68] Mom, if Zaid gets to know about it you have
no idea what he is going to do about it.
[288.03] For God's sake, Zoya, 
please stop getting scared.
[294.81] Besides, whatever I am
doing is because of Zaid only.
[299.05] Mom, he hasn't done any such
thing that I deceive him like this.
[302.99] Why? Haven't the people in
this house made your life hell?
[307.35] Still, Mom, this is no way to take revenge.
[310.69] You are so stupid, that's
why I have to do all this.
[314.56] But I promise, I'll
take care of everything.
[316.93] Everything is going to be fine
and no one will know anything.
[332.67] Look at this, the interior
of your new restaurant.
[336.19] Wow, Sania, this is amazing.
[338.93] Isn't it? I knew it you are
going to like it for sure.
[342.00] Obviously, it's so simple and stylish.
[345.87] Man, thank God you liked it, 
I was getting really nervous.
[350.00] -But why? I trust you completely.
-Thanks for trusting me.
[353.90] Because I wasn't too confident for it.
This is my first project of a restaurant.
[360.90] And I really wanted you to like it.
[364.36] Sania, if a thing is
good everyone likes it.
[367.13] Yeah but everyone has their own taste.
[371.01] Yeah, that's true.
[372.66] Okay, listen, I am going to get all
this interior made under my supervision.
[378.18] Sure, whatever suits you.
[380.36] Yeah, because I also want to
experience how to deal with workers.
[385.55] And once I get it
[387.56] then you'll see I am going to leave
my job and focus on this work only.
[392.69] Good idea, that's a great thing to do.
[395.22] Yeah, I was always
fond of interior designing.
[398.94] Well, good luck then.
[401.54] By the way, Faiq, shall
I ask you something?
[404.43] Sania, you don't need to
take permission for that.
[407.20] No, actually I was talking
about your friend, Salman.
[413.95] Why? What happened?
[416.52] Does he have any issues with me?
[419.78] Is there any problem,
did he say anything to you?
[421.98] No, he didn't say anything directly,
[425.13] but I get a feeling that he
doesn't really like me much,
[428.81] or may be he is a little insecure by me.
[431.23] No, it's nothing like that, 
I think you are just over-reacting.
[436.08] I don't know, but whenever
I share an idea with him,
[439.48] he responds in a very sarcastic way.
[442.99] Actually, Sania, he has
left his job to join me.
[448.26] I think when you share your
ideas may be he feels bad.
[452.14] Yeah, that's what I'm saying
that he is insecure by me.
[455.73] Okay, you don't worry, I'll talk to him.
[459.39] No, I think I should keep my
suggestions to myself, Faiq.
[463.40] Sania, what's wrong with you? 
No need to be so formal.
[468.91] You are taking interest in
my work and I am liking it.
[472.64] -And what about your friend?
-Don't worry, I'll talk to him.
[476.78] You are doing your job
and he is doing his, that's it.
[480.79] Oh, I remember,
[482.36] you are having lunch with
me tomorrow afternoon.
[486.79] Okay, where and what are we celebrating?
[490.55] I'm sitting with you right now, 
are we celebrating anything?
[493.67] Oh, no, I meant to say that you
are inviting me specially like that.
[498.36] So I asked.
[500.41] Yeah, you can say that
there is a special reason.
[502.92] And what's that?
[504.55] Sania, I want you to visit my home
and meet my mother and my wife.
[508.53] Yeah, that's a good idea, but...
[511.81] If it's a good idea why this 'but' then?
[514.98] Faiq, I'm a bit confused
about going to your home.
[519.20] -But why?
-Just like that.
[522.30] Look, there is nothing such as just
like that. You have to tell me the reason.
[525.92] No, there isn't any reason.
[529.73] Well then you are coming to
my home tomorrow. That's it.
[532.79] -You are so persistent.
-Yeah, that I am.
[536.62] Okay, listen, I'll pick you tomorrow.
[539.84] -No, it's okay, I'll come by myself.
-But your car is broken.
[544.80] Yes, but I can manage.
[546.77] Look, I am coming to pick you
tomorrow, just be ready on time.
[550.89] Oh, God, you'll see, I am going
to complain to auntie about you.
[554.86] All right, you can
fulfill this wish of yours too.
[556.70] Now show me the rest of the designs.
[567.46] Really, Mom? Are you telling the truth?
[570.71] Yes, I am telling you the truth.
[573.53] I just can't believe that I am
going to become a grandmother.
[576.96] I feel as if it was just yesterday when I
got the news that you came into this world.
[581.81] Zaid, may God bless you
with the happiness of your child.
[585.39] Thank you so much, Dad.
[587.25] You know, I have already thought of
names, for boys and for girls too.
[591.64] You and Zoya may choose from them.
[593.89] -You thought of names so soon?
-Yes, why not?
[597.61] I didn't get any chance to do
that when my kids were born.
[601.74] This means you didn't like it
that my mother named our kids.
[605.99] Of course, they were my kids,
[610.80] A mother has some desires too, 
but nobody cared about me.
[614.06] I just got informed that
we have kept this name.
[616.73] And now you are thinking to do the same
with Zoya, what is she going to think then?
[621.02] No, Azmat, I'm not going to do that.
[623.30] I am just asking them to
choose from those names.
[627.90] Mom, you have got full permission to
choose from me, rather from me and Zoya.
[633.65] -You are free to choose.
-Look at that, my good up bringing.
[638.89] Anyway, if you guys need
to do some shopping go ahead,
[640.63]  and I am going to start from tomorrow...
[642.01] Have a little patience, 
there is still a lot of time.
[644.70] You should concentrate
on Zoya's health for now.
[647.08] -And you too, my dear Zaid.
-Sure, dad.
[651.96] Don't you worry about that. 
Leave that to me.
[655.05] I just don't know how
these months will pass.
[658.31] Go and meet your wife.
[661.26] -She must be waiting for you.
-Okay.
[668.82] I'm so happy. It seems as happiness has
come to our home after such a long time.
[674.10] Yes, your happiness is
apparent on your face.
[677.95] Why? Aren't you happy, Azmat?
[680.75] A person is happier to get
[682.44] the profit on his principal
investment than the principal itself.
[685.97] The only difference is that you are
expressing your happiness
[687.74] through your words
and I'm feeling it within.
[691.52] But we both are going
through the same situation.
[716.28] Mrs. Zaid,
[718.93] the news that I just heard, is that true?
[724.17] If you have got the
news then it must be true.
[728.14] No, but I want to hear it from you.
[731.79] Yes Zaid, I'm, I'm expecting.
[735.50] Really? Thank you so much!
[738.69] I just don't understand how
am I going to react, I mean...
[743.12] someone is going to call
me dad. Can you believe?
[751.83] Look, if I do anything weird just
let me know. It's just too much.
[757.51] -So, do you think that I'm used to all this?
-No, I didn't mean it that way, but...
[764.80] You, when did this happen?
[766.64] I mean when did you get the test
done? You didn't even tell me.
[772.56] Actually, I got the test
done at mom's place.
[775.71] I wasn't feeling well there so she
asked me to get the test done.
[779.70] Why didn't you tell me if
you weren't feeling well?
[783.13] -Actually...
-Right! How would have you surprised me then?
[786.78] I get it, I get it, all right.
[792.40] You don't seem too excited.
[796.58] Everything okay?
[797.39] No it's nothing, just a little anxiety.
[805.30] Listen, Zoya, I know that we are a little
distanced from each other since past few days.
[811.99] But I want you to forget everything.
We are going to start afresh.
[816.07] Just forget everything, we are not
going to fight over the past anymore.
[821.05] And whenever you want anything,
your servant is here for you.
[825.60] Be it 3:00 am or 7:00 am, just kick
me without hesitation and wake me up.
[830.82] Okay, means this offer
is valid for the child only?
[834.24] -Of course not...
-No, I mean don't I have any importance?
[837.53] Actually you are important only, I was
just saying dialogues from some movie.
[843.15] Seriously, Zoya, anything you want.
[846.67] Whatever you want, I'm there for you.
[850.05] Are you going to do whatever I ask?
[854.03] Yes, anything.
[862.51] Come let's go inside.
[865.05] Come on.
[870.06] Auntie, he is married now but he
still gets stubborn over petty things.
[875.02] Oh, please, stop it, it's no use.
Mom knows that I'm not stubborn at all.
[878.91] Right, mom? Tell her that.
[879.89] -I don't want to interfere between you two.
-See, what did she say while smiling?
[885.66] Mom has aid that she
doesn't want to interfere,
[887.94] means she has no evidence
to prove that I'm stubborn.
[891.92] Basically she wants to
say that you're too stubborn.
[896.10] That's what you think.
[898.18] Sania, just let him talk, please have
something, you aren't taking anything.
[902.80] Mom, just stop, if she takes everything
what is Nosheen going to have?
[907.18] Stop this nonsense, Faiq, she is our guest.
[910.95] Faiq, I haven't seen
Nosheen, isn't she home?
[914.41] No, she is home but she isn't
feeling well, that's why she is sleeping.
[918.40] Oh okay, let her sleep then.
[923.46] -Do you want this?
-Yeah.
[925.50] Oh, you guys started eating without me.
[930.55] I took a little nap, anyway.
[934.22] You weren't feeling well and you
slept too, that's why I didn't call you.
[939.43] Anyway, forget it. How are you feeling now?
Have a seat I'll dish out food for you.
[944.32] No, I'll have it in my room now.
[950.20] Nosheen, meet her, 
she is a good friend of mine.
[954.76] Yeah, Faiq has told me a lot about you.
[960.21] How are you doing, Nosheen?
[962.10] I'm fine, and no need
to be so formal with me.
[972.21] Because I'm much younger than
you, so you can address me casually.
[976.98] Faiq was very right about
you. You're actually very bold.
[981.86] Yeah, that she is.
[984.00] Do you guys talk about
me only when you meet?
[990.40] Yeah, we often talk about you.
[993.05] Really? Faiq has told
me a lot about you too.
[1000.46] Really? Like what?
[1002.15] Like about your marriage
[1005.03] and the toxic relationship
between you and your husband.
[1013.92] I felt really bad about knowing it.
[1015.80] Well, it's good, 
because you have another option now.
[1020.71] You can trap anyone you like.
[1028.29] Nosheen, is this the way to talk?
[1030.92] Oh, I was just joking.
[1033.74] Nosheen, I think you need rest.
[1036.07] You go rest in your room, 
I'll send your lunch there.
[1040.72] Faiq, I think I should go.
[1042.75] It skipped my mind that I need to
make some presentations for office.
[1047.16] How can you go like that, you
haven't even had your lunch yet.
[1049.92] And there is sweet dish too. I
have made a sweet dish for you too.
[1053.22] Sania, mom is right. Just have the
sweet dish and I'll drop you after that.
[1058.55] No, Faiq, I have to leave now. 
Auntie, I'll take your leave.
[1063.12] -Good bye.
-Okay, good bye. Thank you for coming.
[1067.07] I'm going to drop her.
[1084.14] You should have been at
home right now, not with me.
[1086.37] Stop it, Sania.
[1090.00] -I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
-Why are you sorry, Faiq?
[1094.28] I don't know what to say, 
I don't understand anything.
[1099.15] -Please, don't be, it's okay.
-It's not okay.
[1103.02] You came to my house because I forced
you too, and all this is because of me.
[1107.75] Forget it, I told you I didn't mind.
[1111.16] Sania, I'm not a kid that
I don't notice anything.
[1114.34] I hate this girl, I don't like her at all.
[1117.82] -Please stop it, Faiq. She is your wife.
-So what? If I don't like her then I don't.
[1123.37] What can I do about it?
[1126.19] -Sania, I'm falling in love with...
-Just stop it, Faiq!
[1130.57] Don't you dare say anything stupid.
[1132.60] Don't say anything that makes
me not seeing you ever again.
[1139.05] -I'm sorry.
-That's it. Stop the car. Drop me right here.
[1142.80] -But how are you going to go home?
-I said stop the car.
[1145.22] -Sania, how will yo go...
-I said stop the car, Faiq!
[1147.72] Just listen to me, how
will you reach home?
[1149.41] That's it, I don't want to
hear anything. Stop the car and drop me.
[1151.60] -I want to get off here.
-Okay, relax, relax.
[1153.71] What did tell you? Stop the car.
[1156.47] Okay.
[1164.90] -Sania, listen...
-Enough, Faiq.
[1215.92] Oh, God, where is this guy?
[1220.67] He isn't picking up his phone.
[1229.41] Faiq!
[1231.71] Let me just send a message.
[1237.48] Ma'am, this is ma’am Nosheen's report.
[1240.29] Oh, you got her report? 
Okay, you can go, Zafar.
[1245.79] The mechanic to repair the motor is here.
[1249.16] The go get it repaired,
why are you asking me?
[1250.94] We have to pay
him 2000/- Rupees/
[1252.99] Zafar, you have the expense money, give
it from them. I'll take care of it later.
[1258.41] First let me call him.
[1267.13] Faiq, pick up your phone!
[1274.42] What does the report say?
[1279.24] Oh!
[1282.31] It says positive!
[1284.69] Oh, thank you God!
[1286.77] They both are so stupid. 
They keep fighting only.
[1289.91] They don't know that they
are going to become parents.
[1296.12] I won't tell them now. When
they are together, I'll tell only then.
[1300.34] Let me try once again.
[1307.40] He will come home eventually.
[1309.86] Let me check up on Nosheen.
[1320.89] No, we'll meet soon. Take care.
[1324.80] Faiq, come here.
[1328.48] Where are you going?
[1329.80] I am going to set her straight,
and please don't you stop me now.
[1333.57] -Listen to me, first.
-I don't want to listen to you.
[1337.06] -Before you come to me, I have come myself.
-Aren't you ashamed at all?
[1340.75] How were you talking in front of Sania?
[1342.60] Now you are going to tell
me about being ashamed?
[1346.13] The one who has brought her girl friend to
meet his wife and expects me to respect her?
[1350.30] Are you in your senses?
[1351.66] -Faiq! Is this the way to talk?
-Leave me.
[1354.59] Mom, ask her how she
was talking in front of Sania.
[1360.39] Mom, just ask him, has he asked
me how I was feeling even once?
[1364.42] All he thinks about is Sania.
[1367.86] I know everything. All these
excuses are just to avoid chores.
[1372.67] Mom, tell him,
[1376.09] that am I actually unwell
or am I making excuses?
[1379.07] You are actually mentally sick, and
there is no cure for that, Nosheen.
[1382.86] -Shut up.
-You shut up and get out of my house.
[1385.67] Shut up both of you. Just shut up.
[1391.72] I am waiting here for you
both to tell you the news
[1394.69] and you both are fighting like kids.
[1397.53] Sorry, Mom, please say
what you were saying.
[1400.00] Faiq, Nosheen is actually unwell.
[1403.80] I took her to the doctor and that's
why I got her pregnancy test done.
[1419.28] Nosheen, your report is here.
[1423.50] You are expecting.
[1427.85] You both are going to become parents!
[1431.47] And still you're fighting like kids.
[1435.77] I'm sorry, Mom.
[1438.48] Faiq, don't say sorry to me, say it to her.
[1441.60] Try to understand. God has given
you guys such great happiness.
[1444.96] You have to decide you
to carry on with your life.
[1447.79] I am not going to hear any more
fights in this house, understood?
[1490.03] Hello, mama,
[1492.36] Hello, how are you feeling now?
[1495.11] I'm still the same,
[1499.77] Mama, I am going to feel
the same for a few days now.
[1503.58] What do you mean? What kind
of an idiot doctor did you visit?
[1508.65] Mama, you are not getting
what I am trying to tell you.
[1513.17] Oh, Nosheen, I don't have
so much brains in this age.
[1517.32] What are you saying I don't get it.
[1519.98] Okay, then listen to a good news.
[1522.68] You told me that I am
going to become an aunt.
[1526.25] Yes, I did.
[1527.67] Well, then know this
[1528.93] that with your son's child you are going to
become a grandma with your daughter's child too.
[1532.41] What? Such a great news!
[1535.40] Thank God!
[1537.73] God has sent so much happiness to
our home. May he saves us from evil eyes.
[1543.32] Amen.
[1544.57] You know, Nosheen, this
is an honor for a woman,
[1548.81] and God has blessed only a woman with it.
[1551.45] And He has placed
heaven under her feet too.
[1556.38] Nosheen,
[1558.83] why have you gone quiet?
[1560.68] How did your mother in law and
husband respond? Are they happy?
[1565.13] Yeah, my mother in law is very happy.
[1568.16] -And what about Faiq?
-I don't know.
[1571.49] What do you mean you don't know?
Nosheen, tell me clearly what is it?
[1576.03] You are making me worried.
[1577.69] No, mama, it's nothing. Just don't worry.
[1581.84] How can I not worry, Nosheen,
you just made me tensed.
[1584.91] Mama, you are just used
to get worried on everything.
[1588.11] -But Faiq...
-Faiq is happy. He has gone out for some work.
[1593.75] Nosheen, are you telling
me the truth? Is that true?
[1597.38] Yeah, mama, I'm telling
the truth, believe me.
[1600.09] Thank God that He has
shown us this day too.
[1603.83] Look, please now stop fighting with Faiq.
[1607.34] And take good care of yourself.
[1609.46] Mama, if you want you can
inform others at your house too.
[1614.39] Nobody would be happy knowing
about it, but still inform them.
[1620.63] What do you mean by no one is
going to be happy? Why won't they be?
[1625.27] Okay then tell them.
[1627.92] Anyway, listen Nosheen, take
good care of yourself, okay?
[1632.29] Yeah, got it.
[1634.01] Okay now hang up, I think Faiq is back.
[1638.38] Okay, okay.
[1640.28] Oh, God, You have
shown us such a great day.
[1645.72] By the grace of God.
[1653.80] Faiq! Is this the way to talk?
[1655.69] Mom, ask her how she
was talking in front of Sania.
[1663.11] -I have invited Sania.
-What?
[1668.06] The same Sania whom you were taking
selfies with getting too close to her?
[1671.18] You talk such nonsense, Nosheen.
[1673.18] For now, tell me who told
you to invite her home?
[1677.66] Look, Nosheen, this is my home.
[1680.36] And I can invite whoever
I want, whenever I want.
[1683.05] And I am not asking
you, I am telling you
[1685.01] that you have to be
home tomorrow, that's it.
[1717.96] -How was the doctor's visit?
-It was all right.
[1721.73] The doctor has said that by
grace of God, everything is perfect.
[1726.60] You both came at such a good time.
[1730.04] Just see what your sister has
got for the baby from the market.
[1734.23] Neither you are getting
it, nor anyone else.
[1739.46] Everyone is just celebrating 
the entry of a new member, that's it.
[1745.31] Did you ever thing about
the kid who is yet to come?
[1747.62] He is going to watch his parents
fight everyday. How is he going to feel?
[1751.90] Are we going to give him this environment?
[1753.25] Azmat Hussain is one tough nut.
[1758.85] He may give a heart attack to
others but nothing will happen to him.
[1765.97] And don't you worry at all.
[1768.54] Because Zaid is going
to leave Aima for sure.
[1771.43] He has got no other option.
