[0.07] From flowers and from buds
[4.64] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.23] When I saw you
[14.38] I learned to chirp from you
[18.79] Congratulations to you too. May
God give good fate to our kids.
[23.35] Please carry on, I'll be right back.
[32.35] People have such dads who
forgive their children's mistakes.
[36.56] And here my dad, he isn't even
happy for me on such a big news.
[41.16] He will only be happy when I'll die.
[43.51] Were you doing anything important?
[48.14] No.
[49.73] I hope I didn't disturb you.
[52.86] Now what does that mean?
[54.47] Oh, I think they didn't tell you anything.
[58.77] what didn't they tell me?
[60.18] Well, let me tell you then.
[62.46] Zoya has told them
[64.55] that she will continue her pregnancy
only when Zaid gives you a divorce.
[85.51] Faiq.
[97.27] Hello.
[99.24] Where are you Faiq?
[101.70] You left so early?
Why didn't you wake me up?
[108.06] Okay, fine.
[141.14] Oh, God! What shall I do with
this Faisal? How do I get rid of him?
[158.82] Faisal is going to ruin my
life, what shall I do about him?
[177.33] Go to hell you cheap person.
[195.06] Faisal, listen to me carefully...
[197.43] Hey, no greetings, nothing? Is
this how one treats their friends?
[202.28] Faisal, I'm going to give
your number to the police
[205.09] if you call me even one more time.
[213.65] Okay, first think clearly,
[215.99] will you give it to the police
or to the cyber crime branch?
[222.06] By the way, I'm really scared of
the cyber crime people. Honestly.
[226.30] Stop this nonsense, Faisal,
and listen to me.
[230.10] What is wrong? Why are
you so angry early morning?
[234.07] Faisal, what do you think? Am I
going to still get blackmailed by you?
[238.17] Look, I didn't say anything like that.
[241.01] Do one thing, tell anyone
anything you want to.
[247.92] I am not going to be
intimidated by your threats, got it?
[250.99] I can understand anything you say.
[253.20] It's just you who don't
understand anything I say.
[256.50] What is it that you can do?
You can tell my husband at most?
[262.99] Call him right now
and tell him everything.
[267.25] And then wait for what
I am going to do to you.
[271.79] Nosheen, I'm actually scared of you
today. Why are you doing this to me?
[277.32] You think I am only threatening you?
[282.20] I'll tell everything to Faiq myself.
[285.02] Will you tell him everything?
[289.45] Let's do one thing. You tell
him a little and I'll tell him the rest.
[295.96] And yes, tell him how you
spoiled you poor cousin's life.
[304.19] And what places did you go
with me and what did you do.
[307.38] I know you won't be able to
tell all that, you will need my help.
[312.21] Okay then, I'll share those
pictures and all, simple.
[331.07] I wish he dies.
[335.17] What should I do? Whom shall I tell?
Hammad or Zaid?
[341.04] No, this might make things worse.
[344.82] ad, might get to know about it.
[348.53] Maybe he is just threatening
me and doesn't do anything.
[354.06] No, I shouldn't tell anyone.
[403.81] Strange, you are still  doing fine?
[409.73] I didn't get you, auntie.
[412.46] Oh, I think they didn't tell you anything.
[416.80] what didn't they tell me?
[418.15] Well, let me tell you then.
[420.51] Zoya has told them
[422.58] that she will continue her pregnancy
only when Zaid gives you a divorce.
[444.08] I have reached to this conclusion
after thinking a lot over it.
[448.03] I only wanted to do it
because I want some peace.
[453.26] I'm fed up.
[457.53] But, please, don't ever
think that I'm leaving you.
[462.66] Why would I think that?
Besides, it's your right.
[468.84] No, Aima, neither I'm
leaving you nor mom and dad.
[502.99] You should have called
before coming, Faiq.
[506.69] I know,
[507.96] but it was no use calling you because
you wouldn't have attended my call.
[512.56] -I was busy.
-I know.
[515.63] That's why I thought of
coming here without calling you.
[519.92] You might take out some time for me.
[523.14] -Faiq I...
-I know, Sania.
[525.76] You're angry with me because of Nosheen.
[528.48] I didn't mind much what
Nosheen said the other day,
[531.60] as much I disliked what you said.
[535.53] Sania, I say sorry to you for that too.
[538.99] You know, because of guys
like you we girls get infamous.
[545.42] If you guys keep clear intentions
while starting a friendship
[548.65] then no girl would doubt
her husband like this.
[553.26] Sania, I don't have any wrong intentions.
[558.08] You're my friend,
and I like you as a friend.
[563.62] I never think wrong about you,
[566.82] but it's true that I like
to spend time with you.
[571.46] Is this something that
is acceptable for a wife?
[577.54] Answer me.
[579.55] I don't know, but I
have told you how I feel.
[585.35] Trust me, Sania, I have
got good intentions for you.
[589.36] Who is going to explain this to Nosheen?
[591.95] I have already told her that you
are just a good friend, that's it.
[597.04] Really? And what was her response?
[600.05] What else? She asked me to swear
upon our unborn child, and I swore.
[605.81] Congratulations.
[607.94] Thank you.
[608.63] I hope that whatever conflicts
there are between you two, they end.
[614.40] Even I hope so too, Sania.
[617.05] But I don't have those feelings for
Nosheen that a husband has for her wife.
[623.31] These are the things
which confuse me, Faiq.
[626.73] Why do you tell me all this?
[628.91] Because I consider you as a good friend.
[631.40] This is something that concerns your wife,
[634.17] and these things are so personal that you
shouldn't even tell this to your friend.
[638.97] What's wrong with that?
[640.50] I don't want to argue with
you on this issue anymore.
[643.95] If there is something I can
do for you then go ahead,
[646.86] otherwise, you can go from here.
[650.59] Actually, Sania, I came
here to give you this check.
[655.83] You weren't attending my calls, how could
have I told you that your check is ready?
[659.43] Thanks.
[661.36] It's your hard earned money,
no need to thank me for it?
[665.01] But still. Anyway, tell me how
are auntie and Nosheen doing?
[670.20] They both are doing fine.
[671.63] Oh, by they way,
[673.83] -I remember, I forgot to tell you.
-What?
[677.77] Your friend, Salman, he doesn't
talk to me in a sarcastic way now.
[682.37] -Good, that's nice.
-I'm sure, you must have asked him.
[687.01] Yeah, I just explained him once.
[689.88] -Do you want some tea?
-No, thank you. I'll leave now.
[695.56] Faiq,
[697.30] Yeah, what is it?
[698.57] If you disliked anything
that I said, then I'm sorry.
[704.79] No, Sania, it's okay.
[709.66] In fact, I'd like to request you something.
[713.83] Sure, what is it?
[716.36] Sania, can we meet occasionally?
[722.84] Like we used to?
[726.39] Just like a friend, that's it.
[730.34] Okay.
[732.72] Thank you, thank you so much.
[735.83] I'll go now, bye.
[766.08] -Faisal, you here?
-Yeah how did you like my surprise?
[770.64] Have you lost your mind?
Why have you come here?
[773.73] My mind is perfectly fine.
As in excellent.
[777.22] Get lost from here.
[780.77] Who is that, your mother in law?
[783.72] What do you have to do it, be it
anyone. Just get lost from here.
[786.24] How can I go like that? I've come to meet
you, I can't leave without talking to you.
[792.24] -Faisal, go from here, or else..
-Or else? That is my dialogue.
[796.97] Nosheen!
[799.11] Yeah, auntie, I'm coming.
[803.06] Faisal, please leave.
[805.81] Oh, this was the face I
wanted to see, I was missing it.
[809.38] You have blocked me from everywhere.
[813.36] That's why I had t come here.
[817.79] How can you block me from here?
[820.90] -Faisal, go away from here, I say go away.
-Nosheen, who is it?
[824.88] -Greetings, auntie. I'm Faisal.
-Greetings.
[828.03] Oh, are you here to meet Faiq?
[830.35] No, no. Nosheen, won't
you introduce me to auntie?
[833.80] Auntie, actually, he is my...
[837.16] We were together in college,
we're very good friends.
[839.81] Okay.
[841.58] I didn't know where she
vanished after college.
[844.25] She got married. I met
friend who told em about her.
[846.72] So, I thought of meeting her today.
[850.28] Yes, auntie, we were in the same college.
[853.85] We have spent a lot of time together.
[857.72] Look at her how she is treating me.
[860.06] She didn't even ask me to
come inside even formally.
[862.36] No, no, please come in. Nosheen
go take him, I'll ask them to make tea.
[866.84] No, auntie, he just told me that
he came to met just for a while.
[871.81] He has no plans to sit down.
[873.81] No, auntie, thank you so much. I
just came to meet her for a while.
[876.99] I'll definitely stay longer
when I visit next time.
[878.83] Okay, then, Nosheen shut the gate properly
before coming in, I'm calling my auntie.
[886.34] What was that? I'm going to kill you!
[890.15] You will have to meet
me even for that, my love.
[892.40] Keep it low!
[897.51] Tell me what do you want.
Why aren't you leaving me alone?
[900.59] You know very well what I want.
[904.62] And yes, attend my calls.
[909.22] Otherwise, I might have to
meet your husband next time.
[913.51] Okay, go from here right now, please.
[916.47] -First unblock my number.
-I will, now go from here.
[922.27] Okay then, talk to me over the phone.
[925.17] Hurry, go now.
[946.27] Why isn't this boy picking up?
[955.61] Zaid.
[956.97] -Greetings, Dad.
-Greetings.
[959.90] Where have you been?
[962.47] Noting, I just went to a friend.
[965.83] I have been calling you for so
long and you weren't picking up.
[969.16] Were you? I'm sorry.
[974.00] Actually, Dad, my phone was on
silent mode. I didn't notice you calling.
[977.61] No problem.
[979.45] Did you want anything?
[981.65] No I didn't, I was just
checking up on you.
[989.09] What is it? Are you okay?
[993.49] Yeah, I'm okay.
[995.66] I saw, I saw that Zoya is back.
[1001.76] It felt good looking at her coming back.
[1006.20] So, did you talk to her?
[1009.17] Talk about what, Dad?
[1013.44] Oh, okay.
[1017.23] No, I haven't talked to her,
but don't worry, she'll agree.
[1027.16] I wish that it's better that you
talk to her, and clear things up.
[1033.73] Okay, Dad, I'll do it.
[1037.23] Why are you getting worried?
[1039.42] No, I...
[1042.80] -was just thinking about something.
-What's that?
[1048.80] Didn't I tell you?
[1051.90] Hammad only came to the
hospital because he thought I died.
[1059.46] Or about to die.
[1061.10] So, it would be better that he apologized.
[1064.67] But now, he is not
bothered if we live or die.
[1069.23] -It's not like that, Dad.
-What else can it be then,
[1074.05] that he came once and then he didn't
bother to look back and just vanished?
[1078.44] -Dad, Hammad isn't here.
-What do you me he isn't here?
[1082.47] Actually, he has gone
out of country for his work.
[1087.08] And I'm sure, as soon as
he returns he will visit home.
[1090.14] Who told you that he is out of country?
[1093.72] I talked to him myself.
[1097.44] Okay.
[1099.11] All right, if you say I believe
you that he will return.
[1111.62] You know, when do I like kids the most?
[1116.10] When the crawl.
[1118.62] Actually, I don't like kids that much
[1121.68] but it makes me so excited to think that
I, I mean we are going to have a child.
[1131.25] -Faiq.
-Yes?
[1134.27] Are you busy?
[1136.67] Yeah, a little. You carry on.
[1138.87] Faiq, can't you stop your
messaging and talk to me for a while?
[1146.57] Nosheen, what is so important
that you want all my attention?
[1152.66] Faiq, I have to go to the doctor's
tomorrow, will you take me?
[1160.48] What time?
[1163.22] 2:00 pm?
[1166.16] Nosheen, I'm a little busy at 2:00,
you can go with mom.
[1170.90] What are you saying?
[1174.24] It's not auntie's but your responsibility
to take me to visit the doctor.
[1178.71] I know, Nosheen.
[1180.65] If you do then you should come with me.
[1183.20] This is our first child,
we should be together.
[1187.12] Why do you create such a
big issue on such a petty thing?
[1190.13] When did I make an issue?
I just want you to come with me.
[1196.46] And what are you so busy with
that you can't come with me tomorrow?
[1200.74] Nosheen, why do you make
an issue out of everything?
[1205.28] When I've told you to go with mom, I'll
send the car what is your problem then?
[1209.34] I have an issue.
[1211.23] The doctor is going to do my ultrasound
tomorrow and I want you to be with me.
[1216.18] Okay, I'll be there.
[1288.95] Oh, I was thinking that my
daughter is sleeping all day today.
[1293.30] Half of the days has passed.
[1295.83] No, auntie, I wasn't sleeping.
I am up since morning.
[1300.41] Why didn't you come out
and have breakfast with me?
[1306.18] I don't feel like it.
[1308.79] Are you feeling okay, Nosheen?
[1312.53] Did something between you and Faiq happen?
[1314.56] No.
[1316.01] What kind of a no is this
which includes a yes too?
[1319.81] Auntie, your son hates me.
[1323.98] What is wrong? Did you
both had a fight again?
[1330.34] I am going to scold him a lot this
time, why does he tease my daughter?
[1336.59] Now, tell me what's wrong?
[1338.38] I'm telling you, Faiq
doesn't love me anymore.
[1345.88] He is regretting getting married to me.
[1348.56] What? Has he said that to you?
[1351.02] -He hasn't said it.
-Why are you thinking like that, Nosheen?
[1356.06] It's obvious through
his tone, his attitude.
[1360.06] Nosheen, at times the
things we are feeling
[1364.84] or what we think is true is all false.
[1368.03] But it can be true too.
[1370.96] Yes, it can be, but I don't
there anything like that.
[1377.96] And lets say if it is like that,
[1380.57] then don't worry, all this will
be settled once the baby is born.
[1384.67] because you both will be so busy
that you won't even remember all this.
[1390.99] Believe me, he is going to fill
the gap between you two with his love.
[1397.31] Do you actually think that?
[1400.98] Yes, I'm telling this
through my experience.
[1406.08] Just stay happy, okay?
[1408.47] Okay, now get up and eat something, okay?
[1433.92] I have already told you, she has no
manners how to talk. She is ill mannered.
[1439.75] It's okay, Faiq. I think she has a right.
[1442.84] -Right? What right?
-She is your wife.
[1446.73] And if she doesn't like
my presence in your life
[1449.58] then I think you
shouldn't meet me.
[1452.28] What are you saying?
[1454.50] No one can disrespect you.
[1458.93] And it's not Nosheen's right.
[1460.81] Rather it's your greatness
that you stood quiet that day.
[1464.24] Faiq, I'm tired of
listening to such bitterness.
[1467.80] This is how people think
about divorced women.
[1470.33] Please Sania, don't embarrass me anymore.
I know you very well.
[1475.97] You have very negative
thoughts about wives.
[1478.82] I don't know if it is your personal
experience or your observation,
[1482.24] but whatever it is, it is a little harsh.
[1484.93] Maybe you're right, Sania, but I...
[1487.61] No, Faiq, no ifs and buts.
[1490.34] It is important for your relationship with
her that you don't stay in touch with me.
[1495.51] Which relation, Sania? What relation?
[1498.34] -What do you mean by that?
-I don't mean anything,
[1501.79] I just know that my mind isn't
coherent with Nosheen's at all.
[1505.44] I don't feel good when I'm with her.
[1507.97] You know, she is 
a cunning and selfish girl.
[1511.49] But yo told me yourself that
you had chosen her yourself.
[1515.33] I did, but a person can
commit a mistake too.
[1519.79] And, by the way, I am not
satisfied by this marriage.
[1523.78] I mean, don't take me wrong,
[1527.10] I can't end my friendship with you.
[1549.38] How did you think of
your auntie today, Zaid?
[1551.95] -Greetings, auntie.
-Greetings. How are you doing?
[1556.88] I'm okay.
[1558.88] What brought you here? 
Why didn't you bring Zoya with you?
[1562.56] Auntie, actually I wanted to talk to you
in private that's why I didn't bring her.
[1565.71] Oh! Go ahead, what do you want to say?
[1571.72] But please, don't say
anything which is of no use.
[1581.30] Oh, means you were about to say
something which I don't want to listen.
[1589.29] I don't know if this is important
for you or not but for me it is.
[1595.88] Okay, I'm listening, what is it?
[1598.43] Ask Zoya to stop being stubborn.
I can't divorce Aima.
[1605.95] She isn't being stubborn, 
it's her demand, Zaid.
[1611.24] She is only going to stay with
you when you will divorce Aima.
[1616.30] -What if I don't do that?
-Up to you.
[1619.38] You can forget about Zoya 
and your kid then.
[1623.27] -Are you threatening me?
-You can think of it whatever you like.
[1627.65] But Zoya is not going to
change her decision now.
[1634.01] My daughter has suffered a lot. 
She is my only daughter.
[1639.84] And I won't let her make 
a compromise of any sort.
[1643.35] Where there is no compromise
in a relation that relation breaks off.
[1647.58] I don't care.
[1649.19] When one has to compromise in a relationship
it is better that it breaks off.
[1653.15] If you can be so sensitive
about your daughter,
[1655.21] can't I be possessive
about my unborn child?
[1658.35] Really? What can you do if Zoya
doesn't want him to bring in this world?
[1666.91] If that's the case then be it like that.
[1671.83] I am going to go to any
extent to get my child.
[1676.02] Even if I have to file 
a case on you and Zoya.
[1678.31] Fine, let it be.
[1681.03] Do whatever you can, 
and Zoya will do whatever she wants.
[1697.84] I had informed Faiq, 
if he comes I'll go with him.
[1702.71] Otherwise, I'll go myself.
[1705.23] Why will you go alone? Go with Faiq.
[1708.19] And if he gets stuck in dome
work then I'll go with you.
[1712.80] Forget it, auntie, 
I know what is he busy with.
[1716.96] Since when you are
tolerating his blackmailing?
[1719.34] And why didn't you tell me before?
[1721.00] Actually, I got scared
[1723.73] that if I tell something to
someone, things might get worse.
[1730.17] -You're mad.
-I just got scared.
[1734.09] Doesn't matter if anyone
knows about it or not,
[1736.27] I'm going to tell everyone that all this
is a drama and I'm not going to be a mom.
[1739.96] What did you get me into, Mom?
[1742.17] Actually, after telling all this at least
I am going to take the burden off me.
[1745.38] Why were you doing it?
[1751.43] What is wrong? 
What is it, just listen to me.
