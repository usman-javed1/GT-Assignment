[0.00] From flowers and from buds
[4.57] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.16] When I saw you
[14.32] I learned to chirp from you
[18.93] Aima,
[21.82] as a father I
[25.38] want to say to you that
[27.94] you marry Zaid.
[30.14] Dad, Zoya isn't home.
She has gone somewhere.
[33.01] Her phone is switched off as well.
[34.69] I don't know where she is,
I'm going to look for her.
[36.42] Zaid, don't worry.
[38.91] I know that she must
have gotten this shock.
[43.15] Where is Zaid?
[44.94] Why aren't you saying something?
What's wrong my child? What?
[50.04] You have ruined
everything Azmat, everything.
[53.48] You have destroyed our happiness.
[56.00] This, what we have done. We have hurt
everyone just for the sake of our happiness.
[74.03] Aima,
[76.08] did you have breakfast?
[81.78] Where is Zaid?
[84.74] I don't know.
[89.94] Look, dear, whatever that has happened
[96.79] consider it as your fate.
[99.18] May be all this was
supposed to happen this way.
[106.91] Did you talk to Zaid?
[109.97] Did he say anything?
[112.83] No.
[113.79] -Did he?
-He didn't come to my room.
[120.95] And even if he did, what
would have he said to me?
[125.06] That he is indebted
[128.12] that I have destroyed
his happily married life?
[133.01] Why are you thinking like that?
[135.10] What should I think then?
Haven't I committed a sin?
[139.15] A man has permission to do so. 
He is allowed to have a second marriage.
[145.24] And no one forced him to do so.
[148.83] He said yes for this marriage himself.
[152.12] Whose permission are you talking about?
[156.84] Did anyone take Zoya's
permission before this marriage?
[160.78] No. Her consent was as
important as mine and Zaid's.
[168.21] But the truth is that none of us
three was willing for this marriage.
[177.17] This is a forced relationship
which has been imposed on us.
[183.97] None of us three is going to be happy.
[186.38] Yeah.
[194.01] I know
[201.34] all of this is happened because of me.
[202.87] How are you feeling now?
[207.08] Did you take your medicine?
[211.21] -I'll have it after breakfast.
-Didn't you have your breakfast?
[216.00] -No.
-Why, mother?
[222.34] I was waiting for you.
[225.61] Come lets go and have breakfast.
[242.32] Zoya, open the door.
Zoya please open the door.
[246.32] Zoya, Zoya I just need to talk to
you for a a while please open the door.
[253.09] Zoya, you know I won't leave until
you open the door and talk to me.
[257.39] Just listen to me, Zoya.
[260.64] Zaid, Zaid!
[264.80] No need to create a scene here.
You have got your answer. You may go now.
[271.10] Zoya doesn't want to meet you.
[275.31] Zaid, go from here.
[290.26] I need to talk to you.
[293.86] -I was thinking to talk to you in private or...
-I'll just leave.
[298.72] No, wait, you can say whatever
you want in front of Aima,
[302.59] I don't hide anything from her.
[303.77] Actually, I cam to tell you my decision.
[310.67] And please put your emotions and feelings
aside and think practically about it, okay?
[320.70] I hope you can understand my position,
Zaid, that why I took this decision.
[326.81] And our friendship shouldn't
be effected by it. It's a request.
[332.48] It's okay, you know, you have full right.
[335.59] it's your right to make
whatever decision you make.
[339.23] You can tell me without any hesitation.
[341.35] Zoya,
[344.70] I hope you didn't take
your decision in haste.
[348.79] No I have taken my decision
after giving it a lot of thought.
[354.84] Zoya, you don't need
to give any explanations.
[357.54] Iâ€™m strong enough to face rejection,
please tell me what your decision is.
[365.94] I came to say that...
[369.84] that...
[371.61] I am ready to marry you.
[413.89] Mom...
[424.18] Mom, please, don't do this to me.
[427.45] Don't be angry with me I can take it.
[431.17] It's no use saying all that. You
should have thought of it earlier.
[436.23] Why are you saying that?
[442.09] You are the most important person for me
[446.10] No, Faiq, nothing effects you.
[452.21] If it had effected you, you
would have considered it,
[454.78] but you didn't care about anything.
[460.46] Neither my principles,
nor my upbringing, nor me.
[465.05] Mother, I was compelled to do so.
[468.29] Why, what was your compulsion?
[471.62] Actually Nosheen, I mean
I'm in love with Nosheen...
[476.94] Faiq, don't you get it?
[479.43] What you are calling love is
just attraction towards that girl.
[484.31] She has lured you towards herself.
[487.00] And good women don't have this trait.
[492.41] But still if you want to call
it love then it's up to you.
[497.55] But remember one thing, as
quickly one falls in love like this,
[501.76]  one falls out of it as quickly as well.
[504.40] It doesn't last long.
[507.38] Mother, Nosheen isn't that type of a girl.
[509.76] You are thinking wrong of her.
[511.37] You don't need to tell me
 what kind of a girl she is.
[514.05] I know her very well.
[518.41] She is a very clever and cunning girl,
[521.63] whom I can never respect.
[526.38] You are thinking bad of Nosheen
because you don't know Aima's reality.
[532.83] The reality that I have kept
from you for so many days.
[535.57] I didn't tell you just for
the sake of your happiness.
[538.72] What are you talking about?
[540.92] Mom, you know just one side of the story.
[547.65] Aima already liked Zaid.
She was not interested in me at all.
[554.16] And the one whom you call a quite
natured girl was quite for me only.
[558.71] Don't you dare put such a
bad allegation on my niece.
[563.49] All this is your and Nosheen's smut.
[566.81] You guys want to put all the blame on her
and save yourself from the embarrassment.
[571.85] Mom, I'm telling you it is like that, whether you accept it or not.
[575.43] No, Faiq, she isn't that type of a girl.
[579.39] I trust her completely.
[581.59] You may provide proof against
her but still I won't believe you.
[589.61] You have done a huge
mistake by rejecting Aima.
[593.49] And you are going to realize it very soon.
[596.19] Are you cursing me, Mom?
[599.69] No, Faiq, no mother curses her own child.
[605.30] I hope that what I said proves to be wrong.
[608.84] but this is my experience telling me
[612.39] that the girl you have
chosen isn't good at all.
[619.87] Anyway, I have canceled all
arrangements of your reception
[623.36] and told the guests
that it is called off as well.
[626.09] Whenever you get time
and you find it appropriate
[628.64] invite your immediate family and
do your reception wherever you like.
[633.93] But, Mom...
[662.54] Tell me, Faiq, I want to
know the truth from you.
[668.23] That's true, Mom.
[672.62] I don't like Aima but Nosheen,
and I want to marry Nosheen only.
[677.02] And you are telling this to me now?
[680.65] When you have come here
with everyone to marry Aima?
[685.84] Faiq, you have disgraced me.
[689.96] I have just promised Shabana and
Azmat that my son won't let me down.
[697.99] If Faiq likes Nosheen, then
they both are going to get married.
[701.88] Try to understand this is
going to be unfair to Aima.
[704.18] It is very important for a boy and
girl to like each other to get married.
[708.84] And because Faiq like Nosheen then
Faiq and Nosheen are going to get married.
[737.43] I was thinking that
when I'll propose her,
[740.47] her reaction is going to
be the same as it was yours.
[744.68] What reaction?
[746.67] When we were practicing, at
least you took my proposal serious.
[750.65] And she started to laugh, I mean seriously?
[755.69] It isn't necessary
[758.80] that the way I think about you, 
others do too.
[767.85] I am delighted that you have no
objection on Zaid and Zoya's marriage.
[771.83] -Whose marriage?
-Zaid and Zoya's marriage.
[798.00] Zoya.
[800.43] Zoya, you can open your eyes.
[815.56] I love you, Zoya, will you marry me?
[845.57] How are you doing?
[848.48] How can I be?
[850.68] I know what you are going through.
[857.20] But believe me my child, it was
really important to take this decision.
[864.02] It was the need of the time.
[868.73] Aima,
[871.04] everyone is blaming me.
[873.13] I haven't committed any sin either, Dad,
[875.99] but I am being judged as well.
[877.86] If you will get angry with me too, 
where am I going to go?
[881.66] You are the only one who understands me.
[885.83] With whom I can share my sorrows.
[888.77] Aima, please don't get angry with me.
[891.35] I'm not angry with you.
[894.41] -But...
-Don't be sad, my child.
[897.23] I have taken this decision for
my sister's life and your happiness.
[901.12] My happiness? What happiness, Dad?
[904.84] Do you think I can
ever be happy in my life?
[907.59] Why are you being so hopeless, Aima?
[911.86] Time is the biggest healer. 
Give this relationship some time.
[915.87] I'm sure things aren't
going to stay the same.
[918.73] They will get better with time.
[923.94] I don't know if you have noticed or not,
[926.02] but there is peace of Shabana's
face after your marriage.
[929.32] You won't find that sorrow on her face,
[931.88] the agony that was there when
your marriage got called off.
[935.04] Sorrow and pain are temporary, Dad.
[937.91] No it's not like that at all.
[941.30] Ask the mother whose only daughter's
wedding has been called off in front of her.
[946.53] I think you don't have any
idea what she went through.
[950.80] Her sorrow and pain doesn't
diminish with time.
[955.18] Rather it increases when our
society rejects her only because
[961.62]  her wedding had been called off.
[964.11] What about me, Dad? You decision
has taken away both my friends from me.
[970.23] Zaid doesn't want to talk to me.
[973.46] Zoya wouldn't want to look at me even.
[976.86] Everything is going to be fine, Aima. 
Just give it a little time.
[982.82] Because I haven't done anything
wrong, it's not a sin, I know.
[987.81] I have hurt people, 
but what could be better than this?
[994.77] I had no other option.
[997.06] Whatever I have done, 
I have made God my witness for it.
[1045.31] Wow, such a pretty chain.
[1050.00] And so heavy. 
Faiq must have got this for Aima.
[1054.13] Yeah, he got it for Aima,
[1057.64] is mine, I have 
the right on his everything, Mama.
[1061.15] Well, that's nice.
[1063.69] By the way, Mama, you guys
were so worried about my wedding.
[1068.25] See, it's done.
[1069.93] It takes just a little time.  And you
all had created just a drama about it.
[1074.44] That Oh, the girl had run off from home,
how is she going to get married now?
[1078.18] Whether she can find a guy or not? 
See didn't I find one?
[1080.99] Okay, okay, I'm well aware of your talent.
[1084.71] Tell me what are you going
to wear on the reception?
[1093.94] What reception?
There isn't going to be any reception.
[1097.92] What do you mean?
[1099.72] Means, Faiq just messaged me
[1103.38] and told me that my mother in
law has canceled the reception.
[1107.12] What?
[1110.02] Mama, I had an idea 
that she won't sit quietly.
[1117.42] That old woman has completely lost it.
[1121.58] But I have set straight so many
people, I'll do it with her too.
[1129.73] Just give me some time.
[1132.31] Just don't delay your reception.
[1135.30] Your friends and relatives should
know that Faiq has married you.
[1140.09] Yeah, so what if it isn't happening at this
venue. It will happen at some other venue.
[1144.63] That's what I mean. 
Get your reception done quickly.
[1150.36] Yeah, don't worry, I'll manage something.
[1156.06] I am thinking of selling this
chain and get a new one.
[1161.74] No, it's so beautiful 
and design is really nice too.
[1166.32] Yeah, but whenever I look a this
chain, I think of that cursed Aima.
[1172.74] Oh, wow, you guys are celebrating here.
[1176.40] -Amber, you?
-Aren't you ashamed?
[1181.04] After destroying my daughter's happiness
you are celebrating here with your daughter?
[1185.21] It's not like what you think it is. I
was going to come to you but...
[1189.02] Enough now. I have
recognized now how you are.
[1194.05] Just sit down, lets talk. 
Go get some water for your auntie.
[1197.57] Stop this drama.
[1200.00] What's wrong, auntie? 
You are crossing your limit.
[1203.63] You shameless person,
[1204.99] you are standing here with so much
confidence after disgracing yourself.
[1209.37] Don't forget that you 
are present in my home.
[1213.90] She is your elder.
[1215.99] She may be an elder in her house.
[1219.02] All her tantrums are because you
have given her so much leverage.
[1223.63] Shameless girl!
[1226.28] After doing such a cheap thing you
are still spitting venom in front of me?
[1230.46] I thought you won't show
your face for years now.
[1233.44] Why would I hide? 
I haven't done anything wrong.
[1236.88] I have married with my own choice, 
do whatever one can do.
[1241.19] What is even your worth?
[1243.15] You disgraced yourself in front of the
whole world and took refuge in my home.
[1247.69] Have you forgotten?
[1248.66] Even your father denied to
keep you and I took you in.
[1252.72] But what did I know you
all are hidden enemies.
[1256.21] Yesterday has passed, auntie. 
Look at me today.
[1259.86] I am happily married and in my
home and my husband's only wife.
[1264.23] Not like your daughter who has
become first wife of someone.
[1266.61] Stop it you guys, please.
[1271.79] It is you who has spoiled her. She
has done all this on your encouragement.
[1277.02] I have seen it today with my own eyes.
[1279.57] She has destroyed my daughter's marriage.
[1281.91] I did which was right for me. How it
effects others isn't my responsibility.
[1288.64] I won't spare you, Nosheen. I won't spare
you all. I am going to destroy your lives.
[1295.21] Amber I can understand your pain.
[1298.67] Forget about my pain and
prepare yourself for your pain now.
[1302.86] Mama, you are giving respect to someone
who doesn't deserve any respect.
[1308.52] But Nosheen...
[1309.73] Forget it, and consider your
sister as dead from now on.
[1313.77] You all are just my enemies now.
[1315.77] Oh come one, I have come
across a lot of people like you.
[1318.96] I am going to make an example
out of you guys, I won't spare you.
[1321.87] Why are you shouting? 
What is all this drama?
[1325.33] Oh!
[1327.44] You are scolding someone else
when you are the one who is at fault?
[1329.69] Then listen, I am shouting because
you have destroyed my daughter's life.
[1334.73] And you will have to answer for that.
[1336.86] Whatever you need to talk about, 
talk to your sister.
[1340.48] Whatever happened, neither I
am responsible for it nor my sister.
[1344.10] Is there any shame in you or not?
[1346.23] What are you saying, Amber?
[1350.94] Why? What do you want now?
[1353.48] Should I respect this
shameless person now?
[1355.64] Hey you, behave yourself!
[1359.71] You are standing in my house
and talking to me in this tone.
[1362.42] Don't you know what I can do to you?
[1364.31] Try to threaten someone else.
[1366.87] Neither am I going to
get scared of your threats,
[1369.35] nor am I going to care
about any relationship now.
[1372.84] Fine, do whatever you want!
[1375.73] You'll see now what
I am going to do with you.
[1378.22] I am going to take such a revenge of all the
injustice that have been done to my daughter
[1382.04] that you are going to
remember it all your life.
[1383.98] Give these empty threats to
some weak and coward person.
[1389.33] I am neither coward nor weak.
[1391.47] Just wait for your turn now.
[1393.89] And your niece and sister,
[1395.72] I am going to do that to them that
the whole world is going to watch.
[1398.68] Almas!
[1400.53] Tell this ill mannered sister of
yours to control herself or else...
[1404.54] Don't point your finger. I am leaving myself.
I am not to keen to stay here as well.
[1409.09] I am going to see all of you.
[1421.20] What is going to happen now? What?
[1423.94] Nothing will happen!
[1425.19] Just shut up, nothing will happen.
[1428.13] We haven't done anything illegal.
[1431.51] Whatever we have done, we
have married Zain with his consent.
[1434.31] What is going to happen, what...
[1436.40] Tell your sister that if she comes
here again and talks non sense,
[1440.95]  then I am going to pull her tongue out.
[1444.82] Don't know where is Zaid. My phone...
[1460.31] My daughter has snatched what
was Aima's, it's all because of her.
[1466.52] And we won't be able to
get rid of all this so easily.
[1471.94] And I am the one who is suffering 
the most because I have to take decisions.
[1491.31] If I ask you something, 
ask something from you, would you say no?
[1499.43] Sure, Dad.
[1503.38] I hope that you won't say no, Zaid.
[1508.77] Dad, tell me without hesitating what I can
do so that we cam get rid of our problems.
[1513.49] Zaid,
[1515.94] I want you to marry Aima.
[1576.34] Okay, tell me one thing.
[1579.70] If tomorrow, that girl, Kinza,
[1583.51] if she has an issue with our friendship.
[1586.74] What are you going to do then?
[1588.65] If she has a problem with our friendship?
I'll leave.
[1592.82] So, aren't you going to explain
her anything and just leave her?
[1613.43] Just listen to me once, just once.
[1616.96] I am going to explain you
everything, just pickup the phone.
[1631.37] Why did you say yes?
[1636.88] Because you proposed me.
[1639.11] What kind of answer is this?
Means if I hadn't proposed you
[1642.41]  this wouldn't have happened?
[1644.69] -What wouldn't have happened?
-This what is happening with us.
[1648.56] No, Zaid, of course not. 
This wouldn't have happened.
[1656.48] What's wrong?
[1680.57] The most difficult time for a mother 
is when she is fixing her marriage.
[1687.02] And I think I am anxious about that.
[1689.83] Mom, I'm very confident about Daniyal,
and I really like him.
[1696.09] And when the marriage is fixed, 
then why not him?
[1700.89] I think he is the best option.
[1703.64] Thank God, this took
the burden off of me
[1706.96] that you are getting
married under my pressure.
[1709.92] Mom, if I had taken any pressure
[1712.19] I wouldn't have rejected 400
other guys before this one.
[1714.98] From flowers and from buds
[1719.54] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[1724.23] When I saw you
[1729.23] I learned how to chirp from you
[1733.78] When life started testing me
[1743.11] Where can one hide from his own shadow
[1751.51] Why did I become unwanted 
Nobody knows that
[1760.76] Not even you know it
Just my Lord knows it
[1771.78] The sorrows that I have draped myself in 
Are burning my body
[1781.18] I have learned how to burn 
By watching the fire burn
[1789.57] Why did I become unwanted 
Nobody knows that
[1798.81] Not even you know it
Just my Lord knows it
[1808.67] I was thinking that from tomorrow, me and
Faiq are going to eat when you are eating.
[1812.66] No need for that. You can eat whenever
you like.  No need to worry about me.
[1818.28] What do you mean? 
Why shouldn't we worry?
[1822.27] You know, there is
no fun in having food
[1824.23] until some elder of the house
accompanies you.
[1826.06] And Faiq hasn't eaten properly either.
[1829.32] I'm filing a case on Zaid.
[1831.57] He is going to come back to his senses
after spending some time in the lock up.
[1836.75] What case?
[1838.41] Well, he has given you
mental torture right after
[1842.83]  and married again without your consent.
[1846.13] Just read it, sign it and after that
[1852.88] sign here as well.
[1856.43] Here.
[1857.22] How can this be, Shabana? I have hurt you.
[1862.10] I have shown you a
dream about a beautiful,
