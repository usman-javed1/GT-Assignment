[0.17] From flowers and from buds
[4.74] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.34] When I saw you
[14.28] I learned how to chirp from you
[19.23] By the way, there are so many people
in the house who can poison his ears.
[23.58] You do get what I'm saying, don't you?
[27.09] What can I answer you about this?
[30.83]  Okay, just keep you stance on this matter.
[34.52] Because if I get to know that
you are the one misleading him,
[40.03] you're going to see then
what I am going to do, got it?
[44.27] Where there is happiness coming to
this house, there is a little sadness too.
[49.31] There is confusion and worries.
[51.75] Regarding what, Dad?
[53.64] Let me tell you. I want that
you both clear it yourselves
[57.13] that you love each other
and want to marry each other.
[72.73] It was my wish
[74.83] that if any one of them
showed interest for the other
[78.43] then I would have talked to them.
They would have never let me down.
[84.24] I wish they liked each other then...
[90.14] only if...
[91.05] Brother, you did whatever you could do.
[98.56] If this relationship couldn't happen then
[101.43] there must be some wisdom of God in it.
[104.25] You are right.
[109.62] Brother, I would say
[112.64] regarding this relationship
I had my doubts too.
[119.38] I didn't feel like telling you about it.
[124.13] Look,
[126.40] Zaid is going to start his new life,
[130.44] he needs your support
and love a lot at his time.
[137.72] Zaid is going to stay very happy
with Zoya, with God's will.
[141.91] And then the girl is from our family,
[148.14] if not yours he chose sister's niece.
[153.82] It doesn't make any difference.
[157.80] Just forget the past
[161.13] and accept Zoya your daughter in law.
[165.99] All right.
[168.78] I am less burdened to know
[171.58] that you weren't satisfied with
that relationship either.
[176.69] And Aima didn't want this
to happen as well.
[180.76] At times one has to let go of one's wishes
[185.36] and accept the reality.
[188.88] I just pray to God that may he make
the children's decision best for them.
[194.47] Brother, you go and get fresh.
[199.65] I'll get you a nice cup of tea then.
[207.68] -Come on.
-I'm sorry, okay.
[247.49] -I don't understand one thing yet.
-What is it?
[251.60] The excitement you had regarding Zaid's
marriage, where did it vanish suddenly?
[258.24] What do you mean? Where can it
go? And who told you that it is vanished.
[262.02] Your behaviour.
[263.91] You don't even ask a single thing
 if I went there, what happened, how did it go?
[269.26] If I didn't ask you can tell,
what did you decide?
[272.51] We have thought that both the families
would sit together and decide for a date.
[277.32] Right after children's exams are over.
What do you think?
[282.19] You can see for yourself.
Do as you feel right.
[285.07] I have done what I thought was right.
[288.20] I went there with some sweet and
I've given Zoya some gift money too.
[292.45] Well that's enough then,
why do you need to go there again?
[295.85] What are you talking about, Azmat?
[297.47] I just went at Amber's
being her sister for now.
[301.22] Now we'll go with the proposal properly.
[303.63] You are Zaid's father,
at least take some responsibility.
[308.33] There are certain ways to do some things.
[310.44] There are protocols to follow.
Some etiquette. Please.
[314.84] You can say that softly too. You
asked for my opinion and I gave mine.
[318.83] Why do you need to get irritated over that?
[320.53] I'm not getting irritated, Azmat.
Have you seen your temper?
[324.99] -What's wrong with my temper, tell me?
-Ask yourself that, what is going on.
[330.97] As soon as things are progressing you are
getting frustrated by this relationship.
[335.22] What are you talking about? Why wouldn't
I like that my son is getting married?
[339.53] Well, you should, but somebody
must have said something to you.
[342.95] Now who would want to stop his wedding?
What nonsense are you talking about?
[346.85] Your sister. Who else is there
in this home to poison your ears?
[352.48] Where did my sister come in between
all this? Are you out of your mind?
[355.58] You must know about it, I'm just
getting an idea because of your attitude.
[362.02] Did Shabana say something else to you?
[364.33] Look, get rid of any suspicion
that you have for Shabana in your mind.
[367.93] Neither she has said anything like that,
nor she is interested in your son.
[372.07] Oh, so you have had a
discussion over this topic with her
[375.22] or else, how would have you known that
she isn't interested in Zaid any more?
[380.11] Stop talking nonsense.
[383.28] She told me once when it came up.
[386.14] Such things
just don't come up just like that.
[390.67] I was wondering what discussion
you both have in private for hours?
[396.63] Will you just stop now? Don't prolong this.
[401.32] Just let me know when you
have to take proposal to Amber's.
[405.56] I have told you. As soon
as I get a date from Amber
[408.31]  then' Ill let you know. We'll coordinate.
[433.31] -I have a lot of complains with you.
-Everything okay?
[439.47] You consider Zaid as your son, so aren't
you happy that his marriage is fixed?
[445.77] How can this be, sister. Who told you that?
[449.59] If it's not that then you should have
come to me, we live in the same house.
[455.31] It's our duty to share
our sorrows and happiness.
[460.32] When you brought the sweets,
I congratulated you then.
[465.07] And was that enough?
[467.62] You could have called Amber at least.
[471.23] Oh, yeah. Actually I didn't think of that.
I'm going to call her.
[478.92] Do I have to remind you
about everything.
[481.32] One should think of
somethings themselves too.
[483.77] As I said, I just didn't think  of it.
If you say I will call her right now.
[489.78] Yeah, if you feel like.
[492.95] I just thought to spend
some time with you today.
[497.42] That so nice of you, sister.
[501.49] Don't you ever think that I am not
happy about Zaid and Zoya's marriage.
[508.27] Believe me, I felt really happy
as soon as I heard this news.
[512.02] I pray that both of them stay blessed
[515.89] and may they have
all the happiness in this world.
[519.45] Amen. May your prayer gets accepted.
[524.73] I want you to get serious
about Aima's marriage too.
[529.57] Look all the girls and boys
of her age are getting married.
[533.32] And it's my wish that her marriage
gets fixed along with Zaid and Zoya.
[540.82] Zoya comes here after
getting married,
[543.16] and Aima goes to her own
home after getting married too.
[546.93] Yes, sister.
[548.08] You have been avoiding me for the
whole year saying yes, sister, yes, sister.
[554.52] Actually, sister, I haven't gotten
any appropriate proposal for her yet.
[558.66] And the proposals she was getting,
brother didn't like them.
[562.54] Oh, leave your brother, forget him.
[565.30] He never likes anyone.
[567.24] Anyway if you say
should I recommend someone?
[570.98] Yeah, sure.
[573.83] My distant relatives, they are
looking for a girl for their son.
[580.44] They asked about Nosheen, first
[583.03] but their son is a little old for Nosheen.
[588.21] So I thought I should ask you.
[590.49] After all Aima belongs to our house too.
[595.13] Okay, sister. I'll talk to brother
so that we can call them over.
[602.90] Okay, please be serious this time
and talk to Azmat.
[607.03] Yeah, sure, I'll talk to brother soon.
[610.01] Okay, get some clothes made
for yourself and ask Aima too.
[613.94] We'll go to Amber's house to fix a date.
[617.09] Yeah, okay.
[632.95] Dad, I've made the reports.
[636.09] You are here and I don't even know.
Nobody informed me.
[638.67] Yeah, actually you were
busy in meetings since morning,
[641.57] so I didn't
want to disturb you.
[644.09] My doors are always open for you.
You can come whenever you want.
[649.78] Show me.
[656.31] I'm really impressed.
[659.87] Excellent, seems like
some experienced employ has written it.
[666.19] I have written it
under Sir Yousuf's supervision.
[668.92] Still, you've
written it very well.
[671.10] You have gotten a masters degree,
it's not an ordinary thing.
[674.30] Dad, it's just been two days
since I have completed my masters.
[678.43] And we'll get to know
when I'll get my result.
[681.65] Look, as far as the result is considered,
I can say it with my eyes closed
[685.64] that as usual you are going
to get a good position.
[691.75] Let me tell you what is
the best thing about you,
[695.76] that in these three four years,
you were never after gaining marks.
[699.30] Rather you have developed
professional skills in you.
[704.66] These marks and all
are limited to the degree only.
[708.53] But in professional life
your skill is what you are going to need.
[711.61] Thank you so much, Dad.
And I'm sure what skills are left,
[714.98] you are definitely going
to teach me those skills.
[717.08] For sure. Tell me where is Zaid?
[720.42] He was telling me
that he is a little busy today.
[723.10] Yeah, very well. His marriage just got
fixed, we won't get to see much of him now.
[731.90] You tell me, what did you do today?
[736.65] Dad, for now I'm working with the research
team under Sir Yousuf's supervision.
[742.34] You will learn so much
after getting trained by him.
[745.37] Yes, Dad, I will try my best.
[748.09] Aima, I wanted that in these 4-5 months
[754.29] you must have know how
about all the departments.
[758.03] It might be a little overwhelming
[761.11] but you'll get to learn a lot.
[764.30] If you say I can ask
the department heads to talk to you.
[768.41] Yes, Dad, I was about
to ask the same from you.
[772.70] You are going to way ahead.
[774.70] Dad, it's just because
of the confidence that you have given me.
[778.56] -I'll go now, I have taken so much of your time.
-Okay.
[783.75] Thank you.
[792.17] Zoya, are you happy?
[797.60] By the way, why did you ask this question?
[802.10] I am really happy that you are going to
my sister's house after getting married.
[806.53] But I am a little anxious too.
[808.89] Because I want you to prepare yourself
very well to take this responsibility.
[816.32] My dear, I want that you
should learn in these six months.
[821.60] Learn? Learn what?
[825.05] Run a house hold, manage your
in-laws, and then there is Zaid.
[831.76] You must remember that Zaid
must be your first responsibility.
[838.07] You have to care about him
and his happiness the most.
[841.94] Mom, I was thinking can't we just
move the wedding date a little further?
[845.59] No, dear. I think It's enough time.
[853.65] After the marriage is fixed,
the wedding should happen soon.
[858.86] Other wise the more you delay it,
the more issues arise.
[863.39] And once you have made
a commitment with someone it's done.
[869.74] Mom, I'm scared that I might
completely change in these six months.
[877.08] No need to change, dear.
[879.72] I just want you to work on your weakness.
[884.24] So, do you think that I have got flaws?
[886.26] No dear, but you often lose your temper.
[890.59] You try to dominate people.
[894.72] And one has to control
a lot after getting married.
[898.43] It's not like I am going to strangers'
house. It's my auntie's house.
[903.50] No mater if your in laws
are the aunties family,
[905.71] but still they are going to be your in laws.
[907.53] There every shortcoming
of the daughter in law is kept an eye on,
[910.63] everything is pin pointed.
[913.31] You can't do your own will all the time.
[916.94] -Mom, you are scaring me.
-I'm not scaring you.
[921.63] I am explaining you so that you
don't have any difficulty adjusting there.
[927.58] Mom, Nosheen is there too.
And who can adjust with her?
[932.52] And you know what kind of a girl she is.
[935.40] It's too difficult.
[936.76] The best thing is to ignore her.
[939.58] That's all right, Mom. But if she is going
to say anything stupid I won't tolerate it.
[944.38] She is not only your cousin,
now she is your sister-in-law.
[947.99] You can't respond to her on everything
in a straightforward way.
[951.94] But how am I going to adjust with her?
[956.31] That's the thing
that you need to understand.
[958.31] And to adjust.
[962.38] Not everything is ideal.
[965.72] If she is a problem maker
be a problem solver.
[972.30] What's up with you suddenly?
[974.04] Mom, do you remember
how much I avoided getting married?
[980.62] I never wanted to do these adjustment,
compromise and all of that.
[989.44] What did you get me into?
[990.97] Every girl has to face it.
[994.39] And the good thing about
getting married here is
[996.13] that you know everything about
that house, about everybody.
[999.64] But if you were going
somewhere else after getting married,
[1002.87] then you would have known about the
problems there after you would have gone.
[1008.60] You're right, no matter who you marry,
in the end you have to face all this.
[1018.07] I just don't understand
how am I going to sacrifice.
[1021.78] I'm not like Aima.
[1023.34] No dear, I do not want you
to be the scapegoat at all.
[1030.58] But I just want you to learn
[1032.91] where you have to roar like a lion
and where you have to mumble like a goat.
[1038.51] Yo, you've got six months. Prepare
yourself properly and Zaid as well.
[1045.45] Mom, how should I prepare Zaid?
[1048.24] -By having a discussion.
-Discussion about what?
[1052.38] Your emotions, insecurities, feelings.
[1058.35] Discuss all these things with him.
[1061.74] All of this is really important
before getting married.
[1065.48] You'll see how much all these things
are going to be beneficial for you.
[1071.51] I think you're right, Mom.
I should to talk to him.
[1088.49] -Brother, I'll come later.
-No, no. Sit, sit. What is it?
[1096.82] -I wanted to say something to you.
-Yeah, go ahead.
[1101.09] Maybe you remember
[1105.48] Aima's paternal auntie sent 
a proposal for Aima few days ago.
[1111.80] So, she called me again.
[1116.66] She is very willing for Aima.
[1119.10] Oh, yes, she has asked it 
for the second time, hasn't she?
[1122.66] Yes, brother.
[1124.77] I wasn't serious about it earlier,
[1129.17] because of a few reasons.
[1132.77] Yeah, I have an idea.
[1134.98] You didn't answer them because of me.
[1137.87] Oh, no, brother. 
Please don't think that way.
[1141.62] I had a few doubts.
[1147.87] Actually, they used to live in Norway.
[1150.25] I didn't want to send Aima 
so far away, across seas.
[1158.19] Sister Nimra , is Aima's paternal aunt,
[1162.07] but still I don't want Aima 
to go so far away.
[1166.61] You know it how it would be possible 
for me to live without her.
[1173.89] That's nice, other wise you know how people
blindly agree for proposals from abroad.
[1179.11] Yes, brother.
[1182.12] You know very well that
[1185.95] I can't be apart from Aima.
[1188.81] I can understand.
[1190.49] Anyway, complete what you were saying.
[1193.17] Actually, sister Nimra was telling me that
they have permanently moved to Pakistan.
[1198.87] And Faiq has started 
his own business as well.
[1202.07] -Faiq? Nimra's...
-Yeah.
[1206.57] He is sister Nimra's eldest son 
whose proposal she has given for Aima.
[1211.73] Younger son has moved to Canada long ago.
[1214.52] Oh, okay.
[1217.71] So, I just wanted them to invite them over.
[1225.55] He is one of our own children, and
[1230.39] then children can meet each other too.
It's been years since we met them.
[1236.14] Yeah, sure, why not? That would be great.
[1239.38] Oh, and, sister told me 
about a proposal as well.
[1244.28] She was praising the family a lot.
[1246.90] Whose proposal?
[1248.83] She didn't give me any details
[1251.51] but she way saying they are her relatives
and have proposed Aima.
[1257.18] Oh, okay, I understand 
who she is talking about.
[1262.77] She mentioned it to me. 
No, no, please say no to Almas.
[1267.71] -Any specific reason, brother?
-I know those people.
[1271.34] That proposal isn't appropriate.
[1273.08] And besides, when her paternal aunt is
willing, it's better that you talk to her.
[1277.51] Yes, brother, you are right.
[1280.42] Set a time with her. Everything
is going to be fine, with God's will.
[1282.74]  He will do better for us.
[1284.30] Okay, brother.
[1285.89] -Shabana.
-Yes?
[1287.80] Look, you don't have to worry about
anything. Aima is my responsibility.
[1291.60] I will do good for her 
as much as I can. That's a promise.
[1295.70] And I know very well 
how to fulfill my promise.
[1299.37] Brother, you didn't need 
to tell that to me.
[1303.85] With a brother like
you, why would I worry?
[1307.44] Bless you. Thank you.
[1329.99] Aima,
[1332.37] how did your day at work go?
[1335.12] Mother, first day at work went great.
[1339.32] It felt like I have learnt 
so much in just a day.
[1343.75] But I have a little headache too.
[1346.89] Let me massage your
head with some oil.
[1349.16] You'll see your headache
is going to vanish.
[1352.67] I need it badly.
[1354.71] Aima, your paternal aunt called.
[1358.22] She was asking about you once again.
[1361.48] -Really?
-Yes. She wants to visit us.
[1368.44] Whenever she calls 
she asks a lot about you.
[1372.21] She wanted it since long. 
She likes you a lot.
[1380.62] You tell me, what do you think about it?
[1386.27] Well, you can do whatever you 
and dad think is better.
[1392.07] That's all right, but your 
consent is important too.
[1398.78] I want that you meet Faiq once.
[1403.98] It's been eight to ten years 
since you guys have met.
[1408.96] So just meet him.
[1411.18] If you like him, then if God wills 
your marriage can be fixed.
[1415.87] Okay?
[1420.40] -Mother.
-Yeah?
[1426.27] Please say yes to auntie on my behalf.
[1449.38] I hope you didn't have any trouble
finding the house after so many days.
[1452.32] Not at all, brother Azmat.
[1454.17] Zaid guided us so well that we
stopped right in front of your house.
[1460.74] Faiq so do you like it here?
[1463.08] Uncle, why won't I? It's my own country.
[1466.37] In fact I had to force myself to
like it there after leaving from here.
[1469.01] That's really nice, son.
[1471.05] Now, you tell me, where
can we have such a country
[1475.50] We have all the four seasons here. 
Our own people, own culture.
[1479.43] There are just some flaws 
that I will try to rectify by living here.
[1482.81] Wow, it's highly unlikely that we see
our children these days
[1486.53] don't forget our culture and
traditions when they go abroad.
[1490.26] Brother Azmat, no doubt
my children used to live there
[1493.64] but their hearts were in Pakistan.
[1496.16] Sometimes they missed flying kites
[1498.04] and sometimes the
hustle-bustle  on Eid ul Azha.
[1501.97] To tell you the truth, one values
his country when one moves out.
[1506.44] One misses it on every festive occasion.
[1510.42] I felt like flying and coming back here.
[1513.64] as soon as Faiq told me that he
want to set his business in Pakistan,
[1517.57] I told him, I'll stay with you.
[1522.61] So, Faiq, what business 
are you planning to start?
[1526.01] Actually, uncle, I have a couple of plans.
[1528.76] I'm researching what kind of products 
can be imported from Norway.
[1533.64] And what kind of products are here
which can be exported to Norway.
[1539.59] And secondly I'm interested in
opening  a restaurant.
[1543.79] And I want to introduce 
some new dishes here. Let's see.
[1548.26] Your idea is great, and I think 
there is a lot of potential in it.
[1553.37] Brother Azmat, 
where is my dear and Shabana?
[1556.58] I can't wait anymore.
[1558.27] I've been waiting 
for so long, please call them.
[1560.87] They must be busy in the kitchen. 
They'll be here any moment.
[1564.23] And where is sister? I didn't
see her either. Is she all right?
[1569.56] She has gone out for some work. 
She'll be back soon.
[1573.51] Zaid, can you please call you mom 
and check where she is?
[1577.75] Okay, sure, I'll just call her.
[1580.34] No, dear, don't disturb
her, I asked just like that.
[1583.81] I thought if she is here I could meet her.
[1590.12] Greetings, auntie.
[1594.67] Greetings.
[1602.46] Wow, Aima, you have become so pretty.
[1606.52] We didn't even realize how time passed.
[1610.02] Look, Faiq, Aima has changed so much.
[1614.00] Yeah, you're right, Mom.
[1616.53] I think auntie has got her 
exchanged with someone.
[1619.77] Remember how she was in her childhood?
Roaming around with two braids on her head.
[1626.91] Don't you dare tease my daughter.
[1630.21] Greetings, brother Faiq.
[1634.37] Aima, don't call him brother at least .
[1637.04] Oh, come on, Mom, it's okay.
[1641.65] And you. don't tease her too. It's been
eight years when she used to have two braids.
[1646.45] She was beautiful then 
and she is very pretty now too.
[1650.75] So, Aima, what are you doing these days?
[1653.19] Auntie, I've graduated.
[1656.46] And now I'm under training in dad's office.
[1659.81] Great, but you still seem 
to be a student of 11th standard.
[1664.15] No one could believe 
that you are a graduate.
[1666.74] Not just a graduate but she is 
a position holder of her university.
[1670.80] And these days she is gracing 
my office with her presence too.
[1673.74] Oh, wow, that's impressive, that not
only you completed your graduation
[1677.37] but you are working too 
along with that. Good.
[1680.33] Thank you.
[1683.58] Children if you want 
you can show Faiq around.
[1687.39] Yeah sure, go and take
a look around with Aima.
[1690.44] Sure, let's go.
[1692.68] Please come.
[1697.14] Zaid, at least pick up your phone.
[1712.08] Hello, what kind of a person are you?
[1715.48] If you aren't picking up my call, 
at least you can message me.
[1718.32] Sorry, Zoya, I had told you.
[1721.48] What did you tell me?
[1722.57] That Aima's auntie 
and her son are coming to meet her.
[1726.51] You mean for marriage?
[1728.87] No, as in they wanted 
a maid for their house, for that.
[1732.50] I mean, it's not right 
to joke about everything, Zaid.
[1735.61] And I didn't know about it, 
that's why I was asking.
[1738.98] -I got to know about it for the first time.
-Seriously? Didn't I tell you?
[1743.02] No, nobody told me. Not even you.
[1747.36] -And you know how forgetful you are.
-Okay, I'm sorry.
[1751.10] Anyway, forget it. Tell me how is the guy?
[1754.83] Honestly, not bad. I mean, 
to tell you the truth, very good option.
[1760.24] Okay, that's nice.
[1762.05] Yeah, I mean he is well settled 
and mature, confident and handsome.
[1767.52] If not anyone else, 
I'm already impressed by him.
[1770.30] Wow, that's great.
[1771.86] And the best part is
that he's quite liberal.
[1774.65] So Aima won't face those 
typical local husband issues.
[1779.40] And what about Aima? Is she happy?
[1782.60] Well, she seemed happy. 
She was getting shy too.
[1785.84] I'm so happy for her. I want to
meet her as soon as possible.
[1789.50] No, no, don't talk about this right now.
[1791.56] Why?
[1792.47] You know until I play a prank
with her I can't be at ease.
[1796.21] Zaid, what are you talking about?
[1798.44] Well, when she is going
to ask me after the meeting
[1800.84]  what's my honest opinion about the guy
[1803.74] I will tell her that I don't like him at
all and she should not marry him.
[1808.36] It's going to be a big mistake.
[1810.16] Zaid, you know how
sensitive Aima is. So don't do it.
[1814.37] If she is emotional 
so should I stop pranking her?
[1817.08] Well, okay, but be careful, you are aware
how emotional she is. She starts crying.
[1822.99] I know it.
[1824.78] Okay, tell me what's his name?
[1828.14] That gentleman is called Faiq.
[1830.66] Faiq? Nice name.
[1832.75] Right now they are having 
a conversation in private.
[1836.11] What?
[1838.12] Hoe has Aima become so confident? Wow.
[1842.17] No, dad asked me to accompany them
[1844.64] but I used the opportunity and left
Aima alone with his special someone.
[1849.95] But you know, by seeing them together, 
I started missing my special someone too.
[1855.91] Stop being so dramatic.
[1858.22] You are such a drama queen.
[1861.33] Okay, forget it, tell me will they agree?
[1864.87] They had requested long time ago,
now it's just us who have to say yes.
[1870.36] Which honestly I think we'll agree now.
[1872.70] Well would be nice.
[1876.33] By the way it would be so nice if all
three of us will get married together.
[1880.35] I'll ask auntie to keep the dates 
close to each other.
[1883.27] Yeah, for sure, you should.
[1885.75] Okay, I'll hang up now.
[1887.86] All right? Okay, bye.
[1899.92] So, after that mama asked
me to go back and I came back.
[1904.99] Why aren't you drinking you coffee?
[1907.87] Actually I'm used to having
black coffee since the beginning.
[1912.00] So, why didn't you tell me that?
[1913.76] -I'll just get some black coffee for you...
-Oh, no. It's okay Aima, please stay.
[1919.37] Besides, I don't want 
to waste such a good time.
[1925.39] By the way, Aima, you know 
what we are here for?
[1929.78] Yes. Mother, told me.
[1934.20] That's nice.
[1936.44] Aima, I have no objection 
on my mother's choice.
[1941.12] I know whatever she has
chosen for me must be the best.
[1944.86] But I want that we both know
each other a bit before that.
[1950.66] What do you think?
[1953.17] Yes, I don't have any problem with that.
[1957.08] -Okay, then tell me.
-What?
[1960.48] Anything about yourself.
[1963.12] What should I tell you about myself?
[1966.80] What you know about yourself.
[1976.64] I'm Nosheen, and this is my house.
[1981.08] I'm really sorry, I thought
my auntie lives here.
[1985.94] She lives with us.
[1988.22] Didn't you see how that lady 
was praising her niece?
[1996.14] I mean, okay everybody has some qualities.
[2001.47] But why did she need to praise her so much?
[2005.01] I don't know, I'll change. 
I wish I could go somewhere.
[2009.99] Well, if you want you can join us.
[2013.55] What happened? Where is she?
[2017.59] With Faiq and Aima.
