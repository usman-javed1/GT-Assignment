From flowers and from buds I have learnt to bloom and be fragrant  When I saw you  I learnt how to chirp from you Brother, what if
Aima has committed suicide? Just shut up, Nosheen.  Can't you
say something nice for once? -Aima!
-What is this madness? -Why are you taking the trouble on yourself?
-Auntie I think we will have to break the door. Are you mad?  You will be trapped,
the police are going to arrest you. What the hell are you talking about? If something happens to Aima,
I won't spare anyone. -God knows, what this...
-Aima! It's a diamond set, I got it for Nosheen. But I haven't shown it to her yet. Wow, the set is amazing. And this would look
really pretty on Nosheen. Just this is of 0.45 million Rupees. I thought, why not prepare her dowry now. If a proposal comes, I wouldn't
have to roam around markets then. That's the right thing to do, sister. Listen, have you started preparing
Aima's dowry? Oh, no... Nothing for now, sister. But the jewelry I already have,
I'm going to give that to Aima. Yes you shouldn't be worried
about it that much. What do you mean, sister? You won't have to
roam around markets like I do. Whatever Aima puts her finger on, her uncle would make sure she gets it. But these things don't matter, sister. We should just pray that God may give them the best fate. I just pray that all girls
get a fate like you people. No worries about food,
clothing and living. God forbid, sister. May Nosheen never have a fate like mine. May God keep her husband's
shelter always on her.  Amen. I'll just go check up on chores. Aima, okay I'm sorry,
just open the door once. Aima what is this childish behavior. I admit it's my fault, just
listen to me once. Aima, open the door, man. -Aima.
-What's up brother? -Nothing.
-Why isn't Aima opening the door then? She is angry with me. Brother, what if Aima
has committed suicide? Just shut up, Nosheen.
Say something nice for once. Okay, let me say something nice. Oh, God, if Aima has tried to commit
suicide, please save her then. You're just pissing me off.  Get lost
from here before I do anything. What are you going to do, brother?  Are you
going to lock yourself up and cry too? -I'm not joking.
-I know no one is joking. But a drama is going on for sure. -Nosheen, just get lost.  Please, get lost.
-Fine. Aima... -Are you going somewhere?
-Me, just like that. Tell me, there was a payment made
of 0.45 million from the card, I just wanted to know where you spent them? I was just waiting for you
to ask this question. Obviously, you have spent such
a huge amount, I would ask. Don't worry, I haven't bought
anything for myself. I have bought a diamond set for Nosheen. Why?  Is it her birthday? No, no.  For her dowry. That's very good. Please say it again, my ears aren't used
to hearing you praising me. When you do something sensible,
I always appreciate you. I often do sensible things, you aren't
able to see it that's a different matter. Yes, show me.
Wow, it's really beautiful.  very nice. Did Nosheen like it? I haven't shown it to her yet. I am being strict with her these days,
before she does anything else stupid. -Are you feeling okay?
-Yes, I am feeling fine? I mean you are being really wise today. It's just that you are
in a good mood today. Yeah, you can say that. By the way, I was wondering, Aima
is two years older than Nosheen. Shabana should also start collecting
these kinds of things for her. I knew that you were going to start
talking about it any minute now. This is the point where you
and I start having differences. It has been so many years, but you still haven't accepted
my sister and her daughter. If I had not accepted them, I would not have let them stay here
even for a single day.  All right? What should I do for them,
place them on my head? You are really selfish, Almas. If thinking about one's children is
selfishness, Azmat, then I am selfish! Keep your voice low, I have
told you a thousand times. Don't know how much malice
she is carrying in her heart. Why did you do it to her? I don't know, it was just a mistake. First tell me, what were you doing on
the phone that you became so angry? Zoya, I have called you so that you can
convince Aima, not to investigate me. Unless you're going to tell me
what you were doing on the phone, I'm not going to call Aima. I was chatting with someone. Don't try to act smart, who
were you chatting with? There was this girl in section C, Kinza. The one who took my number at the party.
I was chatting with her. You didn't spare girls from
other sections as well?  Zaid... Anyway, tell me are you
coming home to talk to Aima or not? Sorry I won't be able to come, I
have to go to dinner with mother. -Please, come on, Zoya.
-I can't come, why don't you understand? Okay, fine, let me call her. It's just that, I'm feeling a bit weird. You know I can't stand it when
you both get angry, for much longer. Well you took my name
for just the heck of it. I know it's Aima whom you
can't stay angry at. No, it's not like that, you
mean a lot to me as well. Don't worry, she can't stay angry
at you for much longer, either.  Tammu! -I hope.
-Ahan, okay.  Take care Okay, listen, tell me what she said. Yeah, I'll let you know.
I have to go now, okay?  Bye. Mother, are you watching that
play called Closed Doors? I am not in the mood to talk
about any useless drama. Oh, the shoot is going on in your own home, and you know who the hero is?  Your son,
and still you are calling it useless? Tell me clearly what it is? Your son is really worried
because her friend... Aima, Aima the best friend has gotten angry
with him and locked herself up in the room. Oh, that mad boy. Mad?  Crazy is the right word. Because mad people are the same
for everyone, mother. But my brother isn't the same with me. If we get angry with him,
he wouldn't even notice it. That witch has cast a spell on him. And now I don't think that witch is ever going to leave this
house of yours. Meaning? Well, she is going to stay
here as your daughter in law. God forbid.  Zaid would be
better off unmarried than this. I won't let this happen. Well let's see.  For now please look
into this issue right now. -Let me go and check.
-Okay, then, good luck. Why isn't Aima picking up her phone? What the hell is she doing? -What's wrong auntie, tell me?
-She isn't opening the door, I... -I am really worried.
-Just don't worry, come, come with me. Why did I become unwanted {\an8}Nobody knows that Why did I become unwanted {\an8}Nobody knows that Do you have any idea what
your princess is doing? Aima?  What's wrong, what did she do? She has annoyed us so much. Sister, at least tell me what it is? -She has locked herself in the room.
-Aima? -But why?
-She can tell that herself. Okay, don't worry, I'll go see and ask her. Why would I be worried? And if she did anything stupid, I'm
telling you, we shouldn't be blamed. What are you saying, sister? Why are they being so dramatic? Let me go check on her. Aima... Aima, dear?  Aima, open the door.
Talk to me, what's wrong? Aima... Aima has never done that before. I think... has she taken something? God forbid, sister. Aima?  Aima, are you listening to me?
Open the door, Aima. Aima!  Aima! What should I do? What... Sister, sister please listen to me, you have the spare keys, right? There must be one of this room too,
can you please get it? You remember I lost those keys, the key
to this room was with them as well. We never got them made again. What should I do? Aima... Aima, my child.
Just listen to me, Aima. Open the door.  What... what should I do?
Oh, God!  Aima... What's happening?  Aima... I... Yes, Zaid... he is outside.  I'll
call him, we'll have to break the door. Zaid, dear... What do you mean, Zoya?
She isn't picking up your call either? Now tell me what I should do? You know what?  I feel like
breaking the door to her room. -Zaid, Zaid, dear...
-Auntie... Aima... Aima is... -What 's wrong, auntie?  Tell me.
-She isn't opening the door, -I... I am really worried.
-Don't... don't worry, come, come with me. -She isn't opening to door... Aima...
-Aima! Aima... Aima, I'm telling you for the last
time, if you don't open the door, I 'm going to break it. -Aima!
-What is this madness? -Why are you taking the trouble on yourself?
-Auntie I think we will have to break the door. Are you mad?  You will be trapped,
the police are going to arrest you. What the hell are you talking about? If something happens to Aima,
I won't spare anyone. God knows what it is... -Aima!
-Aima, my child... Aima?  Water... Aima! I'm calling an ambulance.  Just see
what's wrong with her, mother, auntie. Aima... Aima... my child. Aima, my child, Aima,
what is wrong with you? Aima, Aima... Aima... Aima. Oh, God!  Zaid... Zaid, call the doctor, my Aima... Aima... Do you know what the doctor said about the reason for
your passing out? What if things got out of hand? Brother, I am just fed up of telling
her, please make her understand. Why didn't you eat yesterday? Dad, actually I wasn't
feeling well, so I skipped dinner. And breakfast? I was getting late for university.
That's why I didn't have my breakfast either. You know how low your blood pressure got? Just because of your stupidities. She just got a little better,
and you started scolding her. Look, dear, no matter how busy life gets, But you should make such a schedule, that your
priority should be your diet first. Yes, Dad. Since her university has started, I don't
think I have seen her having breakfast. Mother, I'm fine.
You all are getting worried for no reason. -For no reason?
-You mother is right, dear. If anything had happened to you, we would have
been so worried, think about it. Yes, Dad.  I'm really sorry.
I won't let you guys complain again. -Promise?
-Promise. Zaid, from now on, it's your duty to take care
of Aima's diet in the university. Okay, Dad, but please
tell her to listen to me. Yeah, all right, I haven't asked you
to become her teacher. Shabana, you have to keep
an eye on her at home, -I want to know everything about her.
-Yes, brother. Take care of your health, dear.  Okay? May God give you health.
I'll go now, you take rest too. Auntie, you can go rest for a while too.
I'm right here. No, mother, I have to talk to you about
something, please stay here with me. Okay.  Okay, Zaid you can go,
I'm here with her. What is it dear? -What do you want?
-Nothing, just stay with me. Idiot. You should eat, take care of yourself. What's wrong, Zaid?  Aima is fine now.
Cheer up now. I can't cheer up
until Aima starts talking to me. You should say until she forgives you. -Yeah, same thing.
-What same thing? These are two different things. Aima never gets angry with anyone. Unless the other person does
something really stupid. And if Aima feels bad about someone, once, then he lives or dies, she doesn't care. Zoya, I called you here to support me,
not to torture me. I have been really stressed as is
for the last few hours. Okay, I was messing with you.  Just chill. Chill?  I mean I'm about to die here,
and you're cracking jokes? Okay, fine, here... apologies.  Okay, happy? Zoya, do you have any idea how difficult
these past hours were for me. You know what, Zaid? Looking at you, it seems as if someone has taken away the
favorite toy of a stubborn child, Just look at your face. Zoya, please shed your philosophy some
other time, go talk to Aima first. I'll go to Aima in a while,
Shabana auntie is coming. I don't care, please go, I can't wait. All right, I'm going. By the way, Zaid, have you eaten? -What?  Are you serious?  Since when?
-Since Aima hasn't eaten. Are you mad? Come on, get up, let's go to the kitchen,
come on eat something. I don't feel like it. Okay then, I'll ask Aima not
to forgive you.  Okay? Yeah, as if she's going to listen to you. She listens to me, that's why I'm here. -Who are these flowers for, for me or for Aima?
-For me. -They aren't nice at all.
-Really?  Just like your face. -Why are they for you then?
-Because they are pretty. The drama queen has made
the whole house chaotic. What else do they know
other than seeking attention? I just saw, how all the men of your home
are putting their hearts out for her. What should I do then?  Run away from here? Everything is going in
the wrong direction here. Instead of sending away
auntie and Aima from here, you are talking about
running away yourself? Both of them are infested
like termites in our house. They will leave after
hollowing down the house. Seeing you this uninterested,
it seems you have given up in front of your
would-be daughter-in-law. What are you saying?  Stop this nonsense. Would-be daughter-in-law?  God forbid. Didn't you see brother's craziness
for Aima? Even after knowing something,
you are in denial, then fine. Whatever, I'm not going to let this happen. I have heard, when dad was bringing auntie
to this house, you said the same thing. It was different then. Mother, be it now or then, I don't think your opinion matters to
anyone in this house. You haven't seen the strength of
your mother's decision yet, Nosheen. Dad, the college is taking us on a picnic,
at a farm house. -Hmm, when?
-Tomorrow {\an8}Tomorrow?  They are taking you tomorrow
and you are telling it to me now? Why did I become unwanted {\an8}Nobody knows that Why did I become unwanted {\ an8}Nobody knows that I am just telling you that, Aima is going to shift her home,
not her room. That's more like it.  Now it seems like
you are the owner of this house. Just stick to what you have just said. You'll see.  I am giving you my word today, that this will not happen
while I am alive. Mother, I wanted a favor from you. Nosheen, whenever you say something like
this, my heart starts palpitating. Listen to me at least.  Get me
permission from dad, please. -What for?
-Mother, the college is taking us on picnic, at a farm house,
it's an over-night stay. Are you insane?
Your dad is going to kill me. -Mother, please, please!
-Out of question. You know that your dad won't allow it. But why?  All of my friends are going. Don't insist, Nosheen.  You know your dad
won't allow you to stay outside overnight. I know, that's why I'm asking you.
Please convince him. -Please?
-Enough of exploiting me. Go get the permission yourself. All right, fine.  You want me to
hear all his scolding. I haven't denied it,
but you will take permission yourself. What's this, means you won't support me? -Who wants to go?
-Me. Then you are going to talk to him. Okay, fine, I'll talk to him, but promise
me you are going to convince him. I'm not going to promise,
but I'll try, okay. Hello, miss Aima Hassan, how are you doing? I am perfectly fine.  No need to bring this?
I am not sick. By the way, I needed it. These are my favorite flowers,
and they smell so nice. I know, that's why I've got them. Thank you very much. Okay fine, get up.  You are
not sick or anything.  Come. Where?  Where?  Just wait. -What?  Let's go.
-Where are we going? -Do the market, let's roam around.
-I can't go, hold your horses. I am under surveillance, right now.
Mom, dad, everyone is at home. Why don't you get it? By the way, what's going on
between you and Zaid? I knew it, I knew it very well
that you are going to talk about it now. Look, I don't want to talk
about it or listen to it. Aima you are dragging a small issue,
forget it.  Why are you angry at him? I am not angry at anyone. If you aren't angry, why is Zaid sitting
there like he is going to choke? Can we talk about anything else,
other than Zaid? Are you never going to talk to Zaid? It's not like that.  I... I'm
going to talk to him, but, just like a cousin.
He is not my friend now. Nor do I care about him. Okay, fine. You know what?  Zaid hasn't
eaten since you both fought. -Who told you that?
-Zaid told me himself. It seemed like he was going to
faint right then. He has gone so weak. Is he mad?  Why didn't he eat anything? You... ask him yourself. Here... let me call Zaid
here in your room, wait. Hello, yeah Zaid come to
Aima's room, quick... Yeah, Zoya, you called me? -I was getting your call...
-Yes, I called you, I did. At least you should have listened
to her first, and then entered. Sorry, sorry. Yes, Mr.  Javed Iqbal, I know what you
are saying, but there are too many... Typing mistake is one thing, but you should be careful as it is a
matter of accounts. Who is handling it? Mr.  Darvesh?  Come on.  Tell Mr.  Darvesh
to keep his eyes open while working. One should re-check 10 times
before giving a quotation. Okay, fine.  E-mail me, I'll check it then.
Right away. -Dad, may I sit?
-Hmm, sit. -What is it?
-Dad, I wanted to take permission from you. I'm listening, carry on. Dad, the college is taking us
on a picnic, at a farm house. Hmm, when? -Tomorrow.
-Tomorrow? They are taking you tomorrow and
you are telling it to me now? Dad, actually I didn't go
to college for so many days, I got to know about
it now that I went. -Permission note?
-Dad, I don't have it. -But I remember everything.
-Tell me? Dad, they are taking us to a farm house,
and the teachers are going to be with us. Are just the girls going, or guys too? Dad, everyone is going,
but teachers are going to be there. -What time do you have to leave?
-Around 9:00 or 10:00. Are you going to have
breakfast before leaving? No, Dad, after dinner. What do you mean after dinner? Dad, it's an overnight stay. Are you insane?  Overnight stay? I mean how could you even think about it? Had it been during the day, I would have
considered it, but overnight stay? There is no question of staying out
all night.  What is wrong with your college? What kind of programs are they having? No, Dad, please, don't say
anything in college. Why not?  We pay them their fee. -So, Dad, should I refuse?
-You are still asking? And listen, if there is
anything like this next time, then refuse it
without even asking me. -Go now.
-Okay, Dad. -So, then?
-What, then? Have you forgiven Zaid or not? Oh, thank you, Aima, thank you
so much that you have forgiven me. I was really scared, I swear.  Thank you. I haven't forgiven you.
I didn't say anything. Well not saying anything
means partial agreement. Aima, don't do like this again,
but, thank you. By the way, he asked me to lie to you. What lie?  Look here, here. -What lie?
-Oh, hey?  Which lie? Well, that he hasn't eaten anything
and he has fainted. This fat man was having his lunch there. Zoya!  I swear to God she is lying. I promise I haven't eaten anything. Okay fine, it's good that
you have had your lunch. But I didn't eat anything, I promise. But you have eaten, haven't you? She blackmailed me, I ate only then. She fed me forcefully.  She said if you wo
n't eat I am not going to talk to Aima. What does her talking to me
have to do with you eating? Actually... Actually the things that... I was the one who called Zoya. so that she can sort things out between us, and you have forgiven me!
Thank you. So, you can go now, it's
all good between us. Very bad Zoya, you
shouldn't have done this. You are right, very bad! Huh?  Wait a second.  Are you both trying to fool me? This is how you repay me? I had to forget my commitments, to come here for you, to sort
things out between you two, but... Elders said it right, one
shouldn't make friends. -I am going to faint.
-Oh, miss, miss. Okay, Oh, please, now you do
n't get angry with me. I have other things to do in life. -No, no, please, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-There's only one solution to it. -Yes, Yes?
-You have to take us both for dinner. That's very right. Okay, done. But just end this episode
of getting angry, okay? Hey, threaten her if you want to.
She was the one who was angry. Listen, Aima. I'm telling you seriously,
never get angry with me. Done. -Zaid, should I tell you something?
-Yes, what? -Listen to it carefully.
-Yes, yes. -You...
-I? -You...
-I? Are a really bad actor. -Right!
-Sorry! -I am going to take on dinner, and I am the bad actor?
-Okay, let's be friends. Friends, friends... Aima, friends? -Aima, enough already.
-Yes. Why did I become unwanted {\an8}Nobody knows that Why did I become unwanted {\ an8}Nobody knows that Well then to prove your friendship, give
me a favor. -What kind of favor?
-I am going to leave for the farm house in a little while. Just stay a little longer. Faisal, don't be silly.  Dad, often wakes
up for early morning prayers, just go now. If you could just stay a little longer. Look, I was calling you all night,
but your number wasn't connecting. Don't you lie to me. I must admit, you have made a great plan
to trap me in the name of friendship. Nosheen, what plan are you talking about?
