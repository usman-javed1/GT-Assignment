From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you At least tell me who is the guy? How is the family? Enough, Dad. Enough of your drama. What do you think? I'll marry and
that too with a boy of your choice? Stop this nonsense! I can't believe my eyes, what I've just seen. I just don't understand what had gotten
into brother, he never does like that. Mother, Nosheen must have done
something wrong. Zaid, I've been looking for you since forever,
and you are sitting here. The tasks that dad gave me
regarding the wedding, related to the event,
I was just looking after that. That all right, but you can at least reply
to my messages. What? Actually, I'm sorry. My mobile's battery died
so I was charging my phone. I didn't check my messages. Okay, tell me,
why are you sitting like this? Just feeling a little low. Zaid, you should've told me. Oh, this Zoya... Not everyone keeps secrets like you do. -It's not like that, Aima.
-Look, Zaid, I'm really sorry. Aima, you are saying sorry? Why? I... had I told you all this
on time then all this... Please, Aima it's over now. And it's no use of repeating one thing
over and over again, just forget about it. Zaid, unless I share my guilt with you,
I won't be comfortable, and I won't be able to forget it. What are you guilty about?
I should be the guilty one. What are you guilty about? My sister has done such a cheap
and disgusting thing with you, I just... I'm not able to even look you in the eye. Are you insane?
What are you talking about? I just couldn't imagine
that Nosheen could stoop so low. Zaid, it's true that I got really hurt
because of it, but it is possible
that she didn't intend to do it. And how can you say that? Zaid, Nosheen isn't that sensible.
She is immature. She takes life as a joke. She is doing bad to herself more than me. That poor girl doesn't even know that the decisions she is making
can ruin her life. Aima, she has attacked
your most valuable thing, your honor. And you are calling her a poor girl? Yes, Zaid. It's not her fault.
I feel bad for her. What are you trying to say then?
Whose fault is it? Zaid she is a kid. When elders don't give proper time to kids, don't do their proper brought up, then their personality becomes like this. Like Nosheen is. Look, that is not an excuse. She doesn't get the license to do
anything just by calling her a kid. I know. But I've forgiven Nosheen. At least let her apologize herself first. Just see first
if she is actually ashamed or not. Mother says that forgive others' mistakes
for your own sake. No matter if they are ashamed or not. -Meaning?
-It means that God really likes those who forgive others. And when we forgive someone,
we are the ones who are most relieved. The heart is less burdened. Look, I want you to forgive Nosheen too. You have a big heart, Aima. A person who made sure that
you get humiliated, you have forgiven her without
even giving it a second thought. At times, one is not supposed to think
too much before taking a decision. You are right,
upbringing makes a huge difference. I wish mama had taught something
to Nosheen as well, like auntie. It's okay, Zaid.
Everything is going to be all right. Just forgive Nosheen now. Aima, please.
I don't have such a big heart. I have decided, I'm not going to talk
to Nosheen ever again. No, Zaid. Please don't do like that. Or else, I'd be embarrassed that because of me, two siblings
aren't talking to each other. Look, try to understand. Dad is already too angry with her. I don't want her to lose your support too. Zaid, she needs you. Please, think over it. Okay, let me get you a nice coffee. Thank you. -Greetings, Dad.
-Greetings. Dad, all the arrangements are done,
just the invitations are left. Okay. Just try
that there are minimum people. They are bringing 20-25 people,
we should invite the same. Our family is very social,
and we know a lot of people. How can we invite just 25 people? Just invite a few important guests
and get over with this event. The event will be over, but people
are going to ask too many questions.  They are going to say all sorts of things. What are you going
to say the the relatives? I'm not answerable to anyone. A thousands of questions will raise, Dad, like why are you getting her married
at such a young age? Why is the girl
getting married so secretly? People are going to raise questions
on her character. Those people are going to say all this
for some time, and then they'll stop. Dad, I just don't understand
that why do you think getting Nosheen married
is the permanent solution? I mean look at her. Her habits aren't
like that of a sensible and mature girl. Her own family isn't able to correct her,
why do you think that she'll change for the better after
being a part of some other family. It's like you are putting your problems
on someone else's head. She isn't ready to maintain a relationship
like marriage, Dad, and you know that. What should I do then? I can't think
of a better option than this. I know it's a risk. Yes, but it's a huge risk. When she'll get the responsibilities
of her household, then she is going to distance herself from
the activities that she is involved in now. Our dignity is still intact,
you should consider that enough. That is fine, Dad. But still, getting her married so secretly
would make people doubtful. They'll doubt only. But if she stays home like this,
some new trouble will be created, which she can do, in my opinion. People are going
to point fingers then, they'll despise us. What are you going to do then? Keeping her home
is an apprehension of turmoil. She won't even think
before taking a foolish step. And, Dad, what is the surety that she won't take
such a step after getting married? Everything will be fine. She'll have a husband then, and then
children. She'll be busy with her life. All right, Dad, whatever you say then. Seems like you are feeling better now. You have finally come out of your room. Yes, sister, with God's grace,
I'm much better than earlier. As if she actually is. Did you say something, sister? I just came to tell that I'm going out
to get some items of Nosheen's dowry. -I might get a little late.
-Okay, sister. So, these are the keys to my room. Keep them safely. Unlock the room when the maid is here, and stay with her. There is a lot of valuable stuff
in the room, okay? Okay. Sister, if you need any sort of help
from me then please let me know. If my illness wouldn't
have been a hindrance, I would have helped you with everything. Just stop it. Don't hurt me
by saying all this. No, sister, believe me, I honestly want to help you
with everything. Of course, you both will help me
with everything very happily, because my Nosheen is leaving this home. Rather she is being kicked out
of the house. Whatever has happened, I am really sad about that, sister. Nosheen is very dear to me, just like Aima. Just leave it. There is always a difference
between what you say and what you do. Anyway, I don't want to create a scene
before Nosheen's wedding. It's better that you don't talk
to me about it. But, sister, I want that before she leaves,
she clears her heart from our side. Whatever misunderstandings there
are between us, they all should be solved. The Kashmir issue can be solved, but
the issues between us can never be solved. It's better that you just do
what I have asked you to do. I've given you the keys.
Please stay with the maid. Okay, sister. And listen, if you want to do any shopping
then let me know. Azmat said that he is going
to give his card for it. No, sister, I don't need anything. Whatever you need or don't need,
tell that to your brother. He told me and I've told it to you. Or else you'll complain that sister
didn't even ask us for shopping. Take care of the house. Okay. Auntie, has mama left
her room keys with you? Yes. My laptop is in mama's room,
I wanted that. So please give it to me. Yes, here it is. Lock the room properly
and give me the key back, okay? Nosheen. Nosheen. Nosheen. Nosheen. Dear, you left the door of the room open? Yes, actually I had to go in once again. Still, you know
that your mother's valuables are in there. What if something gets misplaced? Yes, you are right auntie.
Here, take the keys. Aren't you going in again? No I did what I had to do.
I don't have to go again. -Okay.
-Hmm. Okay, fine. That was close. What if she saw me? I just don't know, Amber, how to marry off
my Nosheen so suddenly just like that. I don't understand
what is the need to rush? It's not like Nosheen is getting overage. Weddings like these in
a rush and secretly take place only when there
is a problem with the girl. God forbid, why would there be
any problem with my Nosheen? Exactly, that's what I'm saying. There is nothing wrong with our Nosheen,
then what's the rush? You know how Azmat is.
So stubborn. He does what he has decided. Greetings. You are right about that. Honestly, no one can do anything
about his nature of rushing things. Or else, if we would have looked
for a proposal by taking time, we could have found a younger
and handsome guy for her. Wow, it's amazing that
after so much has happened, someone is ready to marry
Nosheen. Well, good for her. What are you talking about?
What has she done? Really? Usually, Auntie, you give
the news of whole world to mom. Haven't you told her
what your daughter Nosheen has done? Amber, don't believe
on rumors spread by anyone. All of it is because of
 these mother and daughter. I don't know anything about it,
at least tell me what has happened? What's it all about? Let me tell you, Mom. I'm not just accusing her. Or maybe auntie isn't able
to digest the truth. Amber you said your daughter isn't
ill-mannered. See, how is she misbehaving. Mom, I'm not misbehaving,
I'm just telling you the truth. And besides, Nosheen isn't that naive
nor uncle is a hasty person. Besides, no one gets their daughter
married at the age of 18. But if the girl gets out of control,
what other option do the parents have? Oh, God, look how sharp-tongued she is. I'm being insulted here. Oh, at least tell me what has happened? You should be thankful
that someone is ready to marry Nosheen, What she has done, there should
be a complaint filed against her. I think she should go to jail. Aren't you a bit ashamed, Amber? You daughter is like
hitting me with her shoes and you are just sitting and watching. Zoya, go upstairs. And, sister, at least tell me what is it? Is there anything left to say or tell? I thought I am being respected
in this house, but I was wrong. Sister, listen, please. Zoya, are you mad?
Is that the way to talk to your aunt? Mom, she hasn't told you
the whole truth about her daughter. Do you know what Nosheen has done? She tried to blackmail Aima. It's Aima's greatness
that she has forgiven her, or else a case should
have been filed on it. -What?
-Yes. Sister didn't even tell me... Oh, this Nosheen. Thank God Nosheen
didn't create a scene today. What do you mean?
When does my daughter create  a scene? You know what I mean, Mom. I'm just trying to say that she has
behaved very well in front of them today. Which is quite surprising. My daughter is very well-mannered. If people just don't get
stubborn with her she is a gem. Yes you are absolutely right. You have taunted me all my life, did you see how well my daughter
represented you today? Appreciation is due. I am going to appreciate her
when she proves herself in her in-laws. Don't worry, she'll do that too,
God willing. With God's will. I told you to give
the credit card to Shabana, she has to get some stuff.
Did you give it to her? There is still some
shopping left that I need to do,  I'll give her in a couple of days. Are you going to give her on the day
of wedding? I told you to give her earlier. All you are worried about is her. Don't worry, Dad, I'll take her shopping. Dad, I checked the guest list again,
there are around 80 people in total. Eighty people? I said that the ceremony
should take place in a simple manner,  who increased the guests then? Azmat, do we have something to hide, that our guest list needs to be so concise? There was a reason why I asked to do so. It has come to this figure even after
I am not inviting so many. I have a very big social circle. Yeah right, what else have you done all your
life than increasing your social circle. So, shall I get the arrangements done
accordingly then? I wanted to ask you something. My answer even before you start is no! At least listen to me first. Hammad is not going to attend the wedding. What kind of a father is he? His heart doesn't melt
even when it comes to his children. What are you saying, Mama? If I die tomorrow, he won't let Hammad come
to even carry my corpse to the graveyard. Mama. I can understand, Mama. After all I am related
to brother Hammad too. And when someone close to you
goes away from you then it hurts. Only your auntie
and her daughter are close to you. Okay then,  get ready tomorrow.
We'll go for shopping together. Zaid, there is no need for that. I've got
so many clothes, I can wear anything. Zaid, there is no need.... What do you
mean, are you going to wear old clothes? Old clothes don't mean that I am going to wear some
rags picked up from the streets. Don't you worry,
I'll look good in whatever I wear. Oh, please. Just stop it and keep quiet.
You are coming with me tomorrow morning. Zaid, I told you, I don't need it. Okay, at least come with me
to get auntie's dress. -Zaid, did you talk to Nosheen?
-I will. -When, Zaid.
-After a while. Nosheen doesn't have
so much time left here. Zaid she is here just for a few days now. -At least talk to her, please.
-Okay, Aima, I'll do it. She needs you. You are
her elder brother, so prove it. -There are so many issues.
-What's wrong? Kinza is upset with me again. Why? Actually, I couldn't give
her much time past few days. And when she asked
what I was busy with, then I told her that I had
few issues in my family. In return she said, 
no you aren't serious about me at all.  Had you been serious,
you would have told me the details. I mean, what should I do? So, why don't you invite her
at the wedding? In fact that would be even better.
She could meet dad and auntie. Oh, wow, why didn't I think of that? You're a genius. That's right, killing
two birds with a stone. Kinza gets happy too,
and mama and dad will get an idea too. In fact, let me text her right now. Hello, Faisal, I'm ready, are you here yet? Okay, I'm coming. Oh, I'm such a fool. Let alone humans, even the animals don't
want me to get married with my own choice. Shall I get you some breakfast? I'm sorry, I disturbed you both this early. No, Dad, it's nothing like that. Actually nobody else is awake
in this house so early other than you two. Brother, we really like it
when you come and sit with us. Tell me something, why aren't you both
doing any preparations for the wedding? Why aren't you buying
any dresses or anything? Dad, I have told Zaid, I have got two dresses at home,
already, that I wore at a wedding. They are very expensive. So, I thought I'm going to wear them. Aima is right, brother. And you know well about me.
I don't have to go anywhere usually,  so what am I going to do with clothes? So, who has stopped you?
Who has stopped you from going anywhere? I want you to go out. You have confined yourself in the house. Where shall I go, brother? I don't feel like meeting anyone. Shabana, the problem is,
that maybe you have no idea, that happiness is in one's own hands. If you don't want to get happy
then sadness will become your fate. You get my point? I like it. A wedding is taking
place in the house,  I'll be really glad seeing you
both go out and get ready. -Yes, Dad.
-Okay, brother. Look, there is a wedding,
then there will be dinners. This series of gatherings will carry on
for long and we'll have to be a part of it. So, it's better that you both go
to the market and do some shopping. I'll ask Zaid, he will take you both out. Brother... What is it? I wanted to talk to you
about something important. Yes, I'm listening, what is it?  Brother, consider this as a request
from me, brother. Shabana, you don't need to make
grounds to start a conversation. Say it, I'm listening. Brother, I want that before Nosheen gets married
and goes away, you forgive Nosheen. Yes, Dad. Mother is right. I have forgiven Nosheen as well. Look, brother, It's a very difficult
time for girls when they have to leave their home
after getting married. Leaving their home, and going away
from her parents and siblings, keeps bothering them for so long. Look, right now, Nosheen needs support from all of us. And specially she needs
your love and affection a lot. Look, brother, please listen to me. Forgive her. Fine. Durrani! What happened?
Did you find her? No, madam, I have looked for her in
the whole house, I haven't found her. -Did you look at the roof top?
-Yes, madam. -Okay, let me know when she comes.
-Yes, madam. Where has she gone this early,
and her phone is switched off too. She must have gone to meet that Faisal. No matter how much
I explain her, it's no use. Wow, no one was listening to me,
and when dad said you agreed instantly. Zaid you know well that I never say no
to dad, he is my elder. This way I am you elder too,
I'm two months elder than you. You should listen to me too. Mother, only you can enjoy his silly jokes. There is a thing called sense of humor.
Something that has even crossed you. Besides, only a jeweler knows
the worth of a gem, am I right , auntie? Okay, so if your stand-up comedy
is over, can we leave? -Why? Isn't auntie coming?
-No, son, I'm not coming. I get agitated in crowd. What about your dress then? I have told Aima, she’ll get my dress. And what if there is an issue of your size? Mother is not going to get 
a ready made dress, idiot. Aima. you're not supposed to say like that. Dear, she will get the cloth for my dress. We'll give it to the tailor 
and he will stitch it right away. -Okay, fine.
-Anything else you would like to ask? Yes. Tell me auntie, 
why is she so mad all the time? Okay, enough. Now you guys should go, 
it''s already too late. -Let's go.
-Okay, Mother. Take care of yourself. Yes, that's all right. Me and Zaid are going to take care 
of the rest of the arrangements of dinner and all. But please don't leave 
anything else out. They’ll be done. Don't worry about money. Look, the things is, 
our guests shouldn't have any complains. Okay then let me know. No, no, how will they go there?
Yes, exactly. Okay, good bye. I was talking to the decoration guy. He is a very old vendor of ours. He's been working for us since 
so many years. See how times change. I got Nosheen's Aqeeqa's
event decoration from him And now he is doing the arrangements 
for her wedding too. Anyway, everything is mine 
and Zaid's responsibility. Except for Nosheen. 
She is your responsibility. What do you mean? I mean the wedding dress, make over, 
shoes, take care of all these things. Besides, try to do what she wants. After all she agreed to what I asked her.
She accepted my decision happily. So, I want that the rest 
is according to her choice. She shouldn't have any complains. It''s a huge responsibility 
to get kids married. And you know about me,
whatever I do I do it with all my heart. Yes that's true about you. Well, it''s good that I'm not
the only one who thinks that way. Okay me and Zaid are going to take care, but you should also 
entertain the guests well. Nothing should lack in our arrangements.
Specially for the groom's family. Of course, that's understood. What's wrong? You seem worried. No, no. It's nothing. I know, dear wife. 
I have burdened you a lot by taking such 
a huge decision so suddenly. It's very difficult for you to
marry off your daughter like this. But what could have I done? I had to do so. I hope you can understand my position. Don’t worry, I have made arrangements
for her comfort after marriage too. Just these few days
are going to be difficult, everything is going
to be fine then. If you need anything let me know. No, no. Everything is fine. Do you have any complains, dear wife? No, I'm content with your decisions. Thank God. How did you like 
the groom and his family? The groom is nice, so is his family.
But his age is more and his hair... All these things are secondary. The difference in age is not a big deal. But it's good that you liked the proposal. I wish Nosheen likes it too. Okay, I’ll be right back. Do one thing, send her 
to me while you leave. -Who?
-Nosheen, who else? Do you want something from her? Before she leaves, I want her 
to clear her heart from my side. I don't want her to think of me 
as a cruel person forever. She needs to see my softer side now. That's why I’m calling her.
