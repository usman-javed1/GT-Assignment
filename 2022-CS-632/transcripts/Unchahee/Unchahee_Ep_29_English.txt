From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you Zaid, I think, auntie is forcing Zaid
to marry me, he doesn't like me. Nosheen, everything all right?
You called so early in the morning? Yeah, actually I was getting bored,
so I thought of calling you. Mom, I'm going to Dubai for a shoot. Dubai? Your dad has given permission
for you to join college again. Really? I have booked an apartment for Aima. And I've opened a bank
account for her personal use. So, these are all the documents for those. Mr. Azmat tell me, are you
saying all that in your senses? What is it that I said that you
are taunting me about my senses? You are telling me that you are going to
spend all your money on this mother daughter. When did I say that? I'm giving Aima
what I planned to give Nosheen. Just stop it. Till when are you going
to use Nosheen as an excuse? Nosheen hasn't even got a single pence yet. What ever Nosheen is done
is her own fault. Or else I was... When a child sees her father being close
to strangers then she gets rebellious. Aima is not a stranger! Oh yes she is more close to you than us. That's why you are favoring her with
fists full of gold, this is what proves it. Why don't you do one thing, take some
money from me too and spend it on her. What are you talking about? Whatever is
mine will be my children's after me. Mr. Azmat, they both won't let a penny
remaining in your pocket until you are alive. Lower your voice, what is Shabana listens? I'm not scared of anyone. I'm going to say the same in
front of them what I'm saying to you. They both have robbed us,
both of them are robbers. I'm telling you to lower your voice!
My sister is a heart patient. Your sister doesn't have a problem
with her heart, she has a problem of greed. Since she is here, she has been asking money for her daughter's
studies, or her medical treatment, and now they are using the wedding
as an excuse to mint money. Enough! You have spilled enough venom
against Shabana and Aima. I haven't seen a cheaper woman
than you in my life. Yeah, go ahead and look at your sister, and when you're done
with her then go look at her child. Now just stop spitting
this venom, do you hear? Or else I'm not going
to stop you by just telling you. It's 9:00 pm, auntie,
when will she be back? She must be coming. Seriously, I'm getting worried now. No, no, don't get worried. She often
goes for shopping and gets late... That's okay, but at least
she should pick up my call. Oh, hello! What a surprise! Where have you been, Zoya?
I've been waiting for you for so long. You must have listened to the saying Good things come to those
who wait, right Mom? That's okay but you could have called
and informed, man. Calm down, Zaid, why are you getting angry
on such a small issue? I'm not getting angry. Just look
at the time, I've been calling you for so long. Zoya, you go and get freshen up. And, Zaid, go wash your hands,
I'll get dinner served. No, auntie, I'll go home and have dinner. Come on, I'm just getting it served. Just
take a look, if you feel like you can have it. What is your problem? My problem? Seriously? What is your problem, Zoya? I've been waiting for you here leaving
everything, for the past four hours. I'm sorry, Zaid, but I didn't ask you
to sit here and wait for me. And besides, if you were getting late,
you should have left. -Look at your tone you are using with me.
-Look at your tone. Besides, nobody has talked to me like this. And that too in front of my mom. -Look, I was just concerned.
-You weren't concerned, you very being rude. What is this, Zoya?
You have been out for so long. And what is this attitude that
whenever you feel like you go  and when you feel you'll get back. Try to be a little responsible, man. Zaid, don't try to become my husband. What do you mean? That you will become my husband,
you aren't my husband yet. Fine, do whatever you like. You are telling us to exclude from the
house and you think I'm going to like it? What are you talking about? Mr. Azmat tell me, are you
saying all that in your senses? What is it that I said that you
are taunting me about my senses? You are telling me that you are going to
spend all your money on this mother daughter. I'm giving Aima
what I planned to give Nosheen. Dad, is everything okay? How did you know that I'm here? Aima told me. She was
really worried and said that you got angry
and went away from home. -What happened, Dad?
-Just forget it. Your mother has never given me comfort. And remember, those
who can comfort others they remain restless
all their lives as well. But, Dad, tell me what the issue is,
I'll talk to mama. That's what I'm angry about. That she has made an issue of a non-issue. But, Dad, till when are you going to
stay here? It's so late, come home with me. No, I don't want to go home. I find peace here. How sad it is, that I find peace everywhere
other than my home. Other men go to their homes
so that they find peace and I... I get out of my home looking for peace. -Dad, why is our family dynamic like that?
-Family. The family, dear. A family is because of a woman. There are some qualities in a woman
which change a house to a home. What qualities? Which my wife and your mother lacks. Tolerance and the ability to listen. I absolutely don't mean that the husband should
be cruel to his wife. Be unfair to her. It's a man's duty to love and
respect his wife as much as he can. Gives her all her rights. So that in times of distress
the woman stands by her husband. Be a source of his peace. Instead of arguing with her
on his every decision. Because if a woman
isn't able to listen or tolerate then the house gets in a state in which our house is. Do you get it, Zaid? Yes, Dad, I understand. That's the reason that I came here
from home to find peace. Came here and sat. Just try to learn from my experience
and save yourself from agony. Zaid, I've been waiting
for you for so long, and you have come out
of your room just now. What is it? Did you want something? Zaid, what is this childish behaviour?
Why are you two fighting with each other? Aima, please don't take her side
in front of me. Zaid, I'm not taking anyone's side, I'm just
asking why are you two fighting like kids? This isn't fighting like kids.
It's a genuine issue. She must understand, it's her fault. Look, if you want to make
someone realize their mistake,  this is not the way to do it
how you are doing it. I haven't done anything, Aima. It's her fault. First of all she left without informing me, I kept calling her
and she kept disconnecting. And when I tried to talk
to her she started arguing. You want me to leave all this behind
and apologize to her? But why? You know, I left her house
after being angry last night. She is supposed to call me in principle, she should ask how I'm doing
and solve this issue. Let alone calling she didn't
even send me a message. Aima, what sort of stubbornness is this that she commits a mistake
and then doesn't even apologize. I apologize right away when I'm at fault.
I even go to her place to appease her. It may be possible that she is
expecting you to contact him. If she has committed a mistake,
she has to apologize too. Now she may call me
or come home to apologize. And I'm sure she must have called you
after what happened last night. And she must have told
you her made-up version because of which you
are talking in her favor. I'm not talking in anyone's favor. I'm not taking anybody's side. I just want to know that there are
just a few days left in your marriage. Please end your fight. Till when are you going
to stick with your egos and expect that
the other one will apologize. Look, things won't proceed this way. I know, Aima, in other words you
mean that I should give up in front of her. I'm sorry that's never going to happen. Oh, for God's sake, Zaid, where did
this giving up or surrendering come from? This isn't a battle. She is going to become
your wife in a few days. If you are going to say sorry to her,
what's the big deal in it? Initiating in saying sorry
is a sign of wise people. I'm sorry neither I want to become wise,
nor I am wise. And please don't force me. Fine, if you have decided,
what am I doing here? They both have become a pain. Man, I love the logo.
The design is excellent. I think that our restaurant will be
the most prominent one on the whole street. Do one thing, just complete
all your preparations. I want to do the
opening in next week. Yeah, don't worry about that.
I have talked to the chef. And fix my meeting with Mr. Safdar,
I'm free tomorrow, okay? Okay, carry on with your working.
We'll talk tomorrow. And listen, did you receive
the bank transaction? Good, okay see you. Bye. Nosheen, what are you doing here? Faiq I wanted to talk to you about something
important that's why I had to come. You shouldn't have come here.
Mom isn't home either. I know, that's why I'm here. You know, if someone sees us,
it's going to be really bad. Now please, go from here. Faiq, just listen to me, I have to
talk to you about something important. What is so important
that you want to talk about? And look, we don't have
any such relationship that we talk about important
things in private like this. We have a relationship, Faiq. And it is something which is
supposed to be done in private. Try to understand, it's very important. This important thing could have
been done over the phone too.  You didn't need to come here. Why are you doing this to me, Faiq? Nosheen, please, back off. Faiq, I'm really helpless,
please just listen to me. I don't want to listen
to anything. Get lost! Okay, Nosheen, relax. Stop crying, come here, come in please. Sit here. Look, Nosheen, try to understand. If the maid tell mother,
it's going to be a problem. I'm getting married in a few days. And you being here is very harmful for me. I would have said
what I had to say and left long ago. It's you who is getting angry at me. Okay, I'm sorry. Try to understand my position. Tell me, what is it?
What do you want to say? Look, Faiq, whatever I'm going to tell you, first promise me that you
won't tell that to anyone. And you won't even get angry with me. Will you tell me what is it? Faiq, try to understand,
this isn't some random issue. Promise me that you won't break
your friendship with me either. Can you say what you want to say clearly? Okay, okay, promise. I won't get angry and I won't
break my friendship with you. Now tell me, relax, tell me what it is? Faiq, Faiq, I love you. I really love you. I want to marry you. You went with so much confidence, what
happened then? Your friend didn't agree? I had told you already,
I know her very well. When she gets stubborn about anything she doesn't listen to
anyone, no matter if it's you. What are you trying to say, Zaid? I'm just trying to say that this
isn't as simple as you think it is. One of you needs to break the ice. If she wanted to do that
she would have done it long ago. -One thing's for sure.
-What? I'm not going to apologize. Specially when she has no regrets
over what she has done. You both are making a huge mistake. I know. I have an idea. In fact I am starting to believe
this idea with every passing day that I'm going to commit a huge
mistake by getting married to Zoya. Zaid, are you out of your mind? This isn't a joke that if
you don't like it with one girl  you go looking for another one. -I know, man.
-No, you don't! I thought that you have
gotten mature, but no, you are still mentally stuck in university. You fall in love with someone for four days and then get bored with
her on the fifth, right? It's not like that. -What do you want?
-I don't think this relationship is going to work. It's a mistake. Do you have an idea what you are saying? Just two weeks, there are just
two weeks left in your wedding. All the arrangements
have been done, and you two are quarreling
over just a small thing... You know what? I am crazy, I'm out of my senses to
try to make peace between you two. If you two don't even want to talk to
each other, why am I wasting my time? -Aima, try to understand.
-No, you try to understand, Zaid. This isn't a joke. Okay, fine, I agree that Zoya is stubborn, but sorry to say you don't
like to compromise either. If you think this marriage won't work
then go ahead, end it. I'll be spared with this everyday
tension. I'm sick of you both. Aima, listen to me, Aima, listen. Aima! Nosheen, how can this be? It's done now, I really like you. I don't think you know
what you're talking about. I know, Faiq what I'm talking about. If you don't believe it
you can hear it once again. No, you can't say anything
like this being in your senses. I'm saying it after giving
it a lot of thought, Faiq. I just had to tell you this. I have gathered so much courage
to come here and tell you the truth. You know, if your families get
to know about it they are going to kill us. Rather, nothing is going to happen
to you but I'll be doomed. I don't care. Just tell me what you think. No, this can't happen. Impossible. What are people going to think about us? Stop worrying about people,
just tell me what's in your heart. You want my answer? Then listen, I don't like you, I want to marry Aima. -You're lying.
-I'm telling the truth. You're lying because
a girl like Aima doesn't deserve you. -Why what is it that Aima doesn't have?
-Don't you know? -Nosheen, she is my cousin.
-She is my cousin too. She lives with me in my house.
I know her more than you do. You know nothing about her. Will you tell me clearly
what's the issue with Aima? Aima isn't interested in you. She is just compelled to marry you. How can you put such
a huge allegation on her? It's not an allegation,
I'm telling the truth. Aima likes Zaid since childhood. And as Zaid is getting married to Zoya so
she has no other option than to marry you. A girl who isn't even
interested in you, Faiq, how are you going top spend
all your life with her? -If you don't believe, I can give you proof.
-No. I don't need any proof. And look, I have no
issues with Aima's past. And the reality is that me and her
are getting married. That's it. Why do you want to marry a girl
who isn't even interested in you? Because she is my mom's choice. -Is that it?
-Yeah. And the girl who loves you,
who can sacrifice everything for you you are throwing her out of life,
and that too because of Aima? -If I tell you about what she has done...
-Don't you dare! Don't try to poison me against Aima. Get lost from here right now. You are doing so wrong
to me, Faiq, so wrong. You are rejecting true love. You are going to spoil both of our lives
by getting married to Aima. Nosheen, please, try to understand.
Don't do this to me. It's my wedding in a few weeks,
and I can end this relationship. We can do whatever we want to.
You just need courage for that. Well, just consider that I don't have
enough courage. Now go, please. I'll go, just give me your answer. I have already given you my answer. No, just ask your heart and let me know. Don't you like me? -Nosheen, I...
-Yes or no> Yes. I accept that I like you.
But I can't get married to you. -So are you compelled to marry Aima?
-You can say that. Look, I have been under pressure
to marry Aima for several years. Nosheen, crying like this won't help. You've got a lot of time. You can find anyone,
in fact much better than me. Now go to your home, okay.
Go home and relax. We'll talk later, all right?
I'm not going to tell anyone. Okay? Relax. Okay, Aima, I'm sorry. Sorry! At least you don't do  it. I told you that I won't interfere
in your matter now. Do whatever you like. That's what I'm here to tell you. I have given up, I'm going to talk to her. -But just for your sake.
-What? Zaid, go for your sake. Go for Zoya's sake.
Go for the sake of your relationship. And please stop fighting like kids and
try to sort out your issues on your own. Why don't you tell this to her too? I've told this to her as well,
and I'm telling this to you too. Please, please stop fighting
and try to resolve your issues. I don't know what is going to happen
to you both when I'll move to my in laws. We'll wait for you to visit so that
we can place our case in your court. You are totally crazy. -Hello.
-Hello. -Are you angry with me?
-No. I'm so stupid. Obviously you must be angry. I said such things to you. Sorry, Aima. It's okay, no problem. Besides, I have thought a lot
after what you've said. I'm ready to talk to him, now. And that's for your sake only, okay? Otherwise, I was in no mood. Okay, I'll let him know. I can't
talk right now as I'm a little busy. Okay, bye. It was Zoya. You both are similar. If it weren't for you,
what would have happened to us? Oh, please Zaid, stop it. -Now go and talk to her.
-I will, right now I'm spending time with you. Zaid I have a lot of things to do,
please go now. Fold them properly. -These aren't your clothes.
-That one, fold that properly. Fold this. -I'm doing it.
-Hurry up. You have made your dresses for your
brother's wedding with so much difficulty. Why haven't you made
any dresses for Aima's wedding? Let's see if this wedding
takes place or not. What nonsense are you talking about? You know very well how
much her aunt overindulges her. She is the only one who does that. I just don't get it, you do weird things. Mama, tell me, how much do you love me? So now a mother has to prove her love? I know that you love me, but how much? You must have an idea 
about it yourself, Nosheen. When you ran away, your
father had closed all doors on you. And if you had returned
he would have shot you. Think of all that. Even
after doing so much you are sitting in this house
and that too availing all luxuries. -Because of whom?
-Because of you only. You don't have any doubts 
on my love now, do you? No, no, I just want to test your love 
one more time. Stop being so dramatic.
Tell me clearly what you want. -Mama, get me married to Faiq.
-What did you just say? Just get me and Faiq married. I'm going to slap you tight. You say whatever you like.
Don't you have any manners? Don't you ever try to do 
such cheap prank with me again. I'm serious. I'm not joking. And what's wrong in it?
He is such a fit guy. And rich too. The family is nice as well. You will just have to convince his mom. It's not about his mother, what
about Faiq? He is happily getting married. Mama, that's the secret. That poor guy is marrying
just because of his mom. Otherwise he is in no mood to marry Aima. Who is giving you 
such classified information? Mama, just forget about 
who is telling me all this. But it's true. You have turned into a mental patient. Aima is getting married to a good
family and you just can't bear to watch it. Mama, I'm telling you the truth. You are a big liar. I won't believe you. -Mama, I swear upon you.
-Why do you want me to die? Mama, why don't you believe me? Whatever you are saying 
is just a fragment of your imagination. Aima and Faiq are having a grand wedding.
And that's the reality. I had no idea that your
mental condition is like this or else I would have consulted 
a psychiatrist for you. Fine, don't believe me. 
But you still have a chance. If you want you can talk to auntie Nimra. Just shut up. If you dad gets to know about it 
he is going to do that to you that the world is going to see. You are so scared of me. You are getting married. And you know well that after getting
married the responsibilities increase. I'll be happy if you keep your focus on your
responsibilities more than your hobbies. Faiq, why don't you talk to me? 
I've been missing you for so long. Do you know that I was with Aima? What if she got to know? I don't care whatever she thinks. -Did you see? Nosheen was here.
-Nosheen? With whom? No idea, she just left.
