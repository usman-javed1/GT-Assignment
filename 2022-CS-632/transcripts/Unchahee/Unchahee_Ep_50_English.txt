From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned to chirp from you But you always stay so
chilled out, what's wrong today? Did your wife throw you out of the house? -You guessed it right.
-Oh, no problem. If she threw you out then go back to her. Dad, I wanted to talk
to you about something. Sure, go ahead. I have to talk to you too. But you go first. I was just thinking Dad that for everyone's benefit, I take
Zoya and move out from here. Auntie, tell your son to stop. -Is everything all right? What happened?
-Your son is fooling around with girls. How can you say that? Whatever I'm saying is the truth. He keeps talking to girls all day long,
meet them privately and what not. Nosheen, how can you talk
like that about your husband? I'm not just accusing him. I
have proof of all his cheap deeds. Anyway, listen, have you
told anyone about me at home? No, brother, I have
buried this secret in me. Thank you. By the way, brother, why do you
hide that you are in touch with me? I just don't want that anybody
gets to know anything about me. So won't you ever return home? I think , brother, dad
is going to forgive you. I know his stubbornness quite well. He won't forgive me so easily. At least try, what if things work out? But why are you hiding it from mom? She would be really happy to
know that you are in touch with me. Nosheen you know how simple mama is. She can never keep anything from
dad. That's why I have stopped you. Okay fine, I won't tell her as well. Anyway, I think you're getting late. Your husband must be
getting worried. I'll drop you. Sure, let's go, it's getting too late. -Greetings, mother.
-Greetings. Mother, can I get a cup of tea. 
I'm really tired today. Okay, I'll make you one. But before
that I'd like to say something to you. Sure, go ahead. No, nothing important,
but it's been so many days you didn't tell me about
your engagements. What engagements, mother? I stay busy at the restaurant all
day between managers and employs. And I'm getting a really
good response, you know. And I am thinking of
opening a second branch. That's really great.
One must keep struggling. Mother, do you want to say something? Nothing. You didn't tell me,
 you went to meet your friend. How did it go? I twas nice, I had fun. Mother if you wasn’t to say
something, you can say it directly. Faiq, Nosheen was telling me that these days you are
talking to some girl all the time. She told it to you too? God! Mother, this girl has lost
her mind, it's nothing else. Faiq, if she is saying it
with so much confidence, there must be something that she felt. Mother, it's nothing like that.
And you know Sania very well. You remember she was in school with me?
With whom I used to do combined studies? Yes there was that girl... Yes, the same. Who invited us
over for dinner at her place too and her father used to be in the army too. Oh, that girl! I just found her on social
media after such a long time and I went to meet her, that's it. And don't know what
this crazy girl is assuming. Very bad, Faiq. Don't use such words
for Nosheen, after all she is your wife. It's your duty to give respect to her. Okay, fine. Sorry. Faiq, if Nosheen has a doubt on
anything then sit with her and talk. Try to make her understand. And tell her about Sania
that she is just your friend. Mother, I can't give her
justifications of everything, let her think whatever she wants. Every person thinks differently. Well then let her think whatever
she wants, that's not my responsibility. Faiq, she is your wife, you responsibility. After all you have married her. Oh, God. Mother, I'm fed up. Faiq try to understand. Don't try to incite the issue. If
Nosheen has a doubt let her meet Sania. And what's going to happen then? When she will meet her,
her misconception will be cleared. Do one thing, invite Sania over for dinner. They both can meet each other, this way Sania won't have
any misunderstanding either. Mother, Sania is really broad
minded, and she can't even think of that. And I think inviting her over
to our home is not a good idea. All right, Faiq, do
whatever you think is right. I just feel that by doing this, the distance between you
two might be decreased. And if she will meet your friend's circle
the her habit to doubt you might stop. -Okay, I'll make tea for you.
-Sure. Very good, auntie has
given a very good suggestion Yes, but I think that calling Sania
over to home won't be appropriate. Why so? You've said yourself
that Sania is a very nice girl. And you don't get any
bad vibes from her either, then what is wrong in
inviting her to your home? -You are not getting my concern.
-Then tell me. Actually I don't have an issue with
Sania, but I am afraid about Nosheen. Earlier when she saw Sania's
messages in my cell phone she went crazy, and now if she will see me with her, I
don't know how she is going to react. She won't do anything. 
Just call Sania home. How can you say that? You can inform her that
SAnia is coming before hand. And no one misbehaves with a guest. You think that there is
going to be no problem? Yes. In fact I think that the misunderstanding
between you two will be cleared as well. I just don't get why you are so confused? Actually, Salman, Sania is
a very good friend of mine. And I don't want to spoil my
friendship with her because of Nosheen, Nothing will happen. You are over-thinking. Anyway, forget it. Tell me I have to
get the interior changed of the restaurant.  I didn't really like the previous one. I have talked to a guy. 
No, don't talk to anyone right now. Why so? We don't have much time. We have to get the interior
changed as soon as possible. Actually I have already talked to Sania. Yes, she has done a course too and
her aesthetic sense is very nice as well. Okay. Yes. That's why I thought
that I'll get it done by her. Okay then I'll focus on other things. Yeah, that's fine. You start
hiring as soon as possible. No matter if people ask you for higher
salary, just hire them, money is no issue. Don’t worry, you will get a good staff. But I can ask Sania also, she
can help you with that as well. Really? How? Actually, Sania has a cousin 
who runs a group. And different jobs are posted there. I think we can find some
good people from there. Hmm, good idea. What's wrong? What are you thinking? I was thinking that you could ask Sania, she might have some information
about restaurant management too. Oh, come on, Salman. If anyone can be
of some use for us what's wrong with that? Nothing. I was saying just like that. Then why are reacting like girls? No, I'm not giving any
reaction of this sort. Anyways, be easy. She is just helping us. Yeah, okay. -Won't you offer me some tea?
-Yeah I'll get some tea for you. It's great that you came, Almas. The food is being served,
then we'll have lunch together. I had to come. You should keep visiting,
it's your daughter's own house. Don't know how long it's going to be? Why are you saying that? With God's
will it's going to be always like that. If your son wants only then
this home can remain hers. And if this relationship sustains
only then this home can remain hers. What are you trying to
say, Almas, I don't get you. Anyway, you aren't that naive. Look, whatever you want to say, if
you'll say it clearly it would be better. Your son is having an affair with 
a girl and you aren't even aware of that? Nosheen must have told you that. Obviously, she is my daughter
and she is going to tell that to me. Almas, it can be her whim too. A woman's sixth sense is
very correct in this regard. She can never be wrong. But I have talked to Faiq about it already. And according to him,
whatever Nosheen is thinking is just a misunderstanding, nothing else. People usually lie in such matters,
and I'm sure, Faiq is lying to you. Look, Almas. We have got just two options. One is that we believe
what Faiq said and take this relationship
forward in a good way. And the other is that we
consider what Faiq told a lie and ruin their relationship
with our own hand. Now it depends on you. 
Tell me what do you want to do? I am here just to tell you
that make Faiq understand that my daughter isn't alone. He knows it very well. If her father and brother
didn't join the wedding that doesn't mean that
they are going to watch any injustice being
done to her and tolerate. Just make it clear to Faiq. I just don't understand why are you
thinking so wrong and so far ahead? If you had a daughter you
would have understood this pain. I have always considered
Nosheen as my daughter. All these things are just verbal. When it's time everyone
takes their son's side. You are right, Almas, 
maybe that is how it happens. Because when Faiq left Aima and
said that he wants to marry Nosheen then I didn't force him at all. Look, I didn't mention it to embarrass you. I just want to tell you that children
get emotional and they make mistakes. But it's the job of us elders to use
our sense. and advise them. I am here just to tell you to tell Faiq that if he does anything
stupid to my daughter then I am going to take her away from here. I won't leave her to anyone's mercy. 
Just keep that in mind. Almas, always remember one thing. The responsibility to save
the marriages of children is more on their elders
than on themselves. Because they are taking wrong
decisions while being emotional. And it's the duty of us elders to
use our sense and have patience. And tell them the difference
between right and wrong. And I expect the same from you too that you will be patient
and use your sense. You are right. Nimra but I'm
a daughter’s mother, how can I be patient? Just don't worry. This time I will try that nothing
wrong happens to anyone. Whoever it is come in, will I
get up now to open the door? Mama, you, here at this hour? Yes, it's my daughter's
home can't I visit her? I thought of coming and surprising you. You can visit, but you know that you have already made a
blunder because of this surprise. Oh, Nosheen, forget old things. Why do you have
something new to tell? Yes, I have such a news that
your hear will get crazy with joy. Why? Has Zaid decided
to divorce Zoya and Aima? Oh, what are you saying? God forbid that he divorces Zoya. Zoya is expecting his child. -Really?
-You are going to be an aunt. I will become an aunt. But the cleverness
that your sister and niece have done... What do you mean by cleverness? Well the elders say that when
there comes a child in the house, the woman gets stronger in the house. Your niece has tried the same trick. And now you'll see
what she is going to do. What nonsense do you keep talking. I am telling you mama, she is
going to throw so much tantrums, and your whole house is going to bear them. Now Zoya isn't going
anywhere after leaving brother. God forbid that she leaves Zaid. It's Aima who is going to be removed now. And then we will have
some peace in our lives. Where else would she go? 
She will remain there. I think she will only leave
this house when she dies. Forget that and just
celebrate this thing right now. -You just wait now.
-What for? Well, this, that how Zoya is
going to control brother now. And she is going to make the
whole house dance on her tunes. Nosheen, why are you
thinking so negatively? Okay fine. You'll see,
me and you are here to watch. Forget it, eat this cake. Come on, mama, since you are
here you are talking about yourself only. At least ask something about me. What's wrong with you? You seem fine. I always seem fine apparently. 
But I'm not feeling well. -Nosheen, what's wrong with you?
-I think it's food poisoning. -Come, let me take you to the doctor.
-Mama, come on, relax. I have been to the doctor with
auntie, I had my test done as well. Nobody takes care of
my daughter in this house. What's all right? Faiq as
called that girl over dinner today. What? Nosheen, what are you saying? Your mother in law made so many
claims in front of me the other day. -When did you talk to her?
-Leave that. -At least tell me.
-I came here the other day, I told her that she shouldn't think
that my daughter has no backing. Okay. Yeah, if someone cause
trouble for my daughter and thinks that I am
not going to do anything, I am going to skin him alive. Anyways, don't get so worried.
You daughter isn't so simple that she is going to
tolerate every cruelty. I know how to correct people. For God's sake Nosheen, will
you say something nice for once? Okay fine. You go home and celebrate
your son's happiness. I just want to rest. Okay, take rest. I'll leave. You did very right. Now you will be
get off all the burden off your chest. Yeah, you are right. When there is burden on a person’s
chest, he doesn't like anything. And it was the same with me. I was tired of telling lies. And when you are guilty from
inside, then you start blaming others. You are right. You know, by taking away others' happiness, by hurting them you can
never stay happy as well. Why are you being so sad? You have understood
everything now, so make it right. Yes, you are right, I am
feeling much better now. I hope I will be able to
keep Nosheen happy now. That's more like it. By the way, Salman, there's one thing, people are right, life isn't easy. Stop it, man. You have been
talking philosophy since so long. Life isn't that difficult. We are much better than many
others. You should be thankful. -You are right.
-Then just chill out. Besides it's the inauguration
of your restaurant today. Yes, I wanted to talk to you about it. What is it? I was thinking of bringing
mother and Nosheen along tonight. That's a very good idea. Yeah, I just have to
plan everything with you. Sure, everything will be planned. Tell me, have you invited Sania? No, I haven't invited Sania. If you say I can send an
official invitation to her. After all she has done the
interior of the whole restaurant. Yes, you are right. but may be Nosheen won't like it. And, Salman, I don't want
anything of he sort because of which distances are
created between me and Nosheen. Yeah, that's right too. And you know, I'm very
satisfied with one thing. Which is that mother and
Nosheen are getting along well. And this thing has completely
cleared my heart from Nosheen's side. That's really nice. By the
way Sania is actually a nice girl. That's true. As much interaction I had with her, I have
found her as a girl of very strong character. You know, Sania is getting married. -Really? With whom?
-With a guy, who else? I was asking just like that. -That's nice, she is getting married too.
-Were you planning to propose her? Not a bad idea. Had you told me a little
earlier I could have thought about it. Fine, maybe she wasn't in your fate. Of course. But who can go against
fate? May be someone else then. -Thank you, Salman?
-What for? For always being there. Why do you get emotional like girls? Anyway, tell me, what
are your plans for tonight? You'll tell me, it's our
company's inauguration today. You must have heard. 
Me and Zoya are moving out. Yeah, dd told me. It's a very huge step for me, Aima. I have reached this conclusion
after giving it a lot of thought. The only reason I wanted to
do it was that I wanted peace. I am fed up. But please, don't you ever
think that I am leaving you. Why would I think that? Besides, 
it's your right. No Aima, neither I am leaving
you nor I'm leaving mom and dad. I'm just leaving this house. That too because I need some peace. I'm sick of these everyday fights. I'll pray for you that may this
decision be beneficial for you. Thank you. May be this way we
all might get closer to each other. There are no more complains and grudges. Yes, it is possible. Listen, did dad say anything to you? Regarding what? Means, is he sad because of my decision? May be he is. But he
has no objection on you. He isn't unhappy with you. Aima, tell me honestly, do you think I'm taking the right decision
by taking Zoya and moving out like this. How can I tell you that? This is your life, Zaid. And nobody else would know any
better if your decision is right nor not. and if your heart is satisfied then
you don't need anybody else's advise. Besides, Zaid, you have
followed other's advise a lot. And I have just one suggestion for you now. That do whatever you feel happy about. -Are you happy?
-Me? Where did my happiness come in this? What do you mean, Aima?
You are very important in my life. Your happiness and your
decision means a lot to me. -Is it so?
-Yes. If that's the case then my
happiness lies within your happiness. I'm sure whatever you must have
thought, it must be beneficial for us all. I trust you completely. You can never go wrong. Even I don't trust myself this
much as much you trust me. I really like it, I feel so much peace
when you say all these things. It feels like there is someone who
understands my sorrow, my pain. Thank you for always
being there for me, Aima. Zaid, come dear. What's wrong dad, is everything okay? Noting I was just
feeling a little tightness. Did you lift something heavy? No, I don't remember that
I had lifted any thing heavy. -Dad, please take care.
-Yeah, I will, from now on. Anyway, I called you to ask
you what you have decided? Did you look for a house? Yes, we have visited a couple of
houses and Zoya and me like it. For how much are you getting it? For now I am thinking of renting a place. And if I feel like buying one in
the future I'll get a loan from office. What are you talking about? Loan's option is for employs, 
it's your own company. I'd say, why are you going on rent? If you like he house
then buy it straight away. -Dad, are you sure?
-Of course I am? Whatever I could do to
support you I'd do for sure. thank you, Dad, it really means a lot. Tell me, you will be
coming to office, right? What are you talking about? I
am not going away from you. It's just temporary
because I need a break. Besides, how much do we meet in
this house. You are so busy, me also... Anyway, I hope that we will
going to spend quality time together. And you know it, dad. If I didn't had
to, I would have never left this house. I can understand. You just be easy. Oops! Dad, are you sure you're
okay, should I call the doctor... No, no, everything is fine. 
I was just feeling a little restless. It will be all right. What do you think, Zoya? Is there actually a problem
or is this all a pretense? Mom, why would he pretend? You don't know Azmat Hussain. He is a very cunning and stubborn person. He can do anything to get what he wants. To get his son's sympathies he can
even pretend to have a heart attack -so that his son melts down.
-Really? I feel that he has done all this
to stop Zaid from moving out. In fact, he gave him permission
to move out from here. So, mom, won't I and Zaid shift from here? Of course you will. No one can stop you from moving
out, no matter they if they do any effort. -But for that you'll have to do one thing.
-What mom? Just take Zaid in confidence. -Increase your importance for him.
-Mom, I'm already very important for him. Zoya, make your behaviour so nice that
Zaid never even thinks about hurting you. This is your chance to prove yourself. Help him in his problems. Consider his tension as your
own, but  with that convince him to move out from here too. -Not by using force, politely.
-Yes, you're right. Remember one thing.
Zaid listens to his dad a lot. That's why take care
of him, like Aima does. I will try, I don't know but I'll try. Aima, Aima! Hope for the best. Zaid, I'm really scared. Look, when auntie had a heart attack,
you didn't lose courage even then. You have to be brave
right now, God is merciful. Nothing is going to happen to dad. Tell me, do you want something? Come on, don't cry like that. Just pray, brother Azmat
will get better and come home. That's true Amber, but for the past
few months, our lives have been cursed. and now I'm losing hope now. -When did this happen?
-Around the time of morning prayers. I woke up when I heard something fell down so he wasn't on the bed. When I went in the lounge 
and looked for him then he was holding his
chest and had fallen down. Thank God that I woke
up on time, otherwise I don't know what would have happened? Then you should have
been with him at the hospital. Amber, there are not much
people allowed in the hospital and besides Zaid and Aima
are there, I am not needed there. What are you talking about? 
You are his wife. Had you been near him, he would
have felt content by seeing you. And, by the way, where is
your sister in law, Shabana? She is praying for her brother. By the way, Zaid being there is
understandable because he is his son, but what is Aima doing there? Amber, right now I only
care about my husband. Just pray that he
gets back home safely. I'm sure, you'll see he will be back. Yes, what is it? Faiq, how is Mr. Azmat doing? I don't know, mother. Faiq, why don't you know? Didn't you call Nosheen or Zaid? We are facing calamities only. That's nothing new. When you will hear, you will be
surprised too, your head will spin. I feel that our home is
getting scattered gradually. Enough, mama, I have nothing
to do with this home of yours. Here my life is getting scattered and
you want me to listen to your cries? Hello. Hello, who is this? Hello, who are you? You called, who do you want to talk to?
