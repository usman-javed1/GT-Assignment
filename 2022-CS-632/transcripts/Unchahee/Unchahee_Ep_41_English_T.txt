[0.00] From flowers and from buds
[4.54] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.13] When I saw you
[14.07] I learned how to chirp from you
[18.56] You are blindfolded my your mother's love.
[23.39] And you are unable to see anything.
[29.98] But it's okay.
[31.79] What ever I do for you both,
I can never be good enough.
[35.39] Listen, where is Zaid? Is he happy?
[40.55] Of course, Mom, why wouldn't he be happy?
[44.87] Okay, now be careful,
someone might create a drama.
[49.17] You have been so strangely since I have
returned home. Are you in your senses?
[52.86] What do you care?
All you care about is your mother.
[56.74] Mind your language, got it?
[58.78] This is how I talk.
[60.38] Then do one thing,
get up from here and get lost.
[63.82] As if you are so well-mannered.
Have you ever noticed your tone?
[66.87] My tone gets bad when
your attitude gets bad.
[77.47] Dad, I have collected all their feedback
and emails of our deliveries to them.
[82.36] I'm sure it's going to help
Zaid a lot when he goes there.
[87.22] That's great.
[88.94] Yes, Dad, they have given very satisfactory
replies regarding their deliveries.
[93.36] Now, Zaid just has to go
there and convince them
[99.14] that our deliveries and quality 
has gotten better than before
[104.86] so that they think ten times before
giving this project to any other vendor.
[110.78] I am sure that they are
going to give this project to us.
[116.06] Because we have never disappointed them.
[120.85] In fact we have given urgent deliveries
to them too when they demanded.
[125.15] We just have to bring this in
notice of their top management.
[132.13] Because I'm sure that
their marketing team
[134.57] wants to give this project to
some of their own vendor.
[139.78] But the top management only wants
good quality and timely deliveries.
[147.75] Okay then, you can convince
them too like that when you go there .
[151.62] -Me?
-Yes, dear.
[156.12] You are going to accompany
?Zaid too and I'm sure
[158.81] that you both are going to
be back with a good news.
[162.63] Yes, but me and Zaid?
[166.09] Any problem with that Aima?
[168.55] I don't know but may be
Zoya and Zaid won't like it.
[174.04] Zoya has no right to object on this matter.
[178.93] Like she is his wife, so are you.
[181.63] SO, you don't need to be scared of anyone.
[186.19] I have got both your flight booked,
[188.04] get your packing done, spend two days
there and then get back.
[192.28] But, Dad.
[193.23] I'm telling you, just get
ready and leave the rest to me.
[199.14] Okay.
[216.81] Have some water, Zoya.
[220.38] Zoya!
[222.87] Mom, you were right.
[226.64] I was always wrong.
[229.72] They are never going to let me be happy.
[231.88] And Zaid is just like a puppet.
[234.31] He doesn't think about
anything else than his dad
[237.31] He does what his dad says, 
he thinks only what his dad decides.
[248.62] I don't want to talk to him. 
Mom, I am not going to go there.
[251.74] Mom, please I don't want to go back there.
[253.97] Relax, my dear. Give yourself time.
[257.04] -Tell me, have you eaten anything?
-No, I haven't
[260.85] -Okay, but why are you crying?
-Because I made a mistake.
[265.28] Calm down, Zoya!
[266.45] I can't trust that man. I don't want to go.
[269.55] -Mom, I don't want to go there.
-Calm down, Zoya.
[271.42] This is my final decision, Mom.
[274.77] Zoya, this is not some play of your
university. It's your life, be serious!
[280.29] You don't take such decisions 
on such small things.
[283.57] This isn't a small thing.
[286.16] Whatever is happening is your own decision.
[290.03] You knew it that Aima has entered
Zaid's life and still you went back.
[294.94] Do you remember?
[296.26] Didn't I tell you that you won't be
able to tolerate this relationship.
[301.47] But you said no, I want to go there,
[303.62] I am going to face everything,
I will handle everything.
[308.08] You are not supposed to leave your
home like that on such petty issues.
[313.50] What should I do then?
[319.69] Be brave.
[322.53] My daughter isn't that weak.
[325.46] You will have to face all of them.
[351.08] Until this old woman is in our lives, 
nothing can be right.
[363.25] Where were you? I have
been calling for so long.
[366.32] Why were you calling me? 
I didn't ask you to call me.
[369.28] What do you mean, why was I calling?
[373.74] You are away for the last two
hours and I shouldn't even call you?
[376.65] That's what I am saying, why were you
calling? You should have gone to sleep
[380.52] What nonsense, Faiq?
[384.95] I'm your wife, I was worried about you.
[388.39] Please, Nosheen, you don't need
to worry about me at all, understood?
[392.88] Okay, tell me where have you been?
[395.10] I went to find some peace 
that I am unable to get here.
[399.94] Oh, okay, means I'm
destroying your peace?
[403.28] You're right.
[406.20] Since you have come to this house, you
have destroyed the peace of this house.
[410.89] Wow, great, you are blaming
me when you are the one at fault.
[415.38] What does that mean?
[419.26] What wrong have we done to you?
[421.10] That's the problem.
[422.30] since I have come to this house, neither
you guys have given me any respect,
[425.63] nor you have made me
feel like I am a new bride.
[431.58] I am working like a mule 
since I have come here,
[433.77] and listening to scoldings 
by you and your mother.
[437.15] Nosheen, you don't do any difficult work.
[444.13] An if one doesn't feel like
then every work seems difficult.
[450.19] And as far as scolding is concerned,
[451.94] you should think yourself why do
you get scolded over everything.
[454.35] What is it that you do to us?
[456.38] Is that what I should do all
day to think like an idiot
[459.57] what is it that you and your
mother treat me this way?
[463.55] Well, there's nothing
wrong with that either.
[465.13] There is nothing much that you do all day.
[469.26] You are always busy with your
mobile, playing games, using Insta gram
[473.17] chatting with friends that's it.
[475.68] Enough, Faiq, you are saying too much.
[478.61] You should be thankful 
that I am just saying right now.
[482.49] Keep your threats to yourself.
[484.27] I am not scared of your threats, nor
am I scared of your threats to hit me.
[489.88] These aren't just threats, Nosheen. 
The way you are misbehaving,
[496.46] I'm afraid these threats 
might turn into reality.
[499.70] Oh, hello, mister. This is 2022,
what do you think I won't do anything?
[503.14] -I am going to file a complain against you.
-Really?
[506.20] The way your conduct is,
[511.08] those you are going to complain
will slap you a few times themselves.
[513.75] -I didn't know that you are so cheap...
-Please, enough now,
[516.46] Stay here if you can lie quietly, 
or else you may leave the room.
[540.11] She is just coming.
[543.41] Should I get some tea made for you?
[546.23] No, auntie, it's okay.
[551.60] I'm sorry, auntie, your plan
couldn't happen because of me.
[556.66] Actually, there was 
an urgent issue in our business.
[560.11] Zoya, didn't even listen to me. 
She just got angry and came here.
[565.51] What's urgent and what's
important, it's for you to decide.
[571.70] Anybody could have taken care of the
issue at work, your dad could have done it.
[575.96] But you chose that over Zoya's happiness.
[581.52] I tried my best to find someone
who could go in my place but...
[585.37] it just didn't happen.
[587.70] It's okay, 
I have got your trip rescheduled.
[593.05] When you get back from
Islamabad you can go then.
[596.13] Thanks a lot. I just hope 
that Zoya is in a better mood now.
[601.40] I have cooled her down with so
much difficulty. I convinced her all night.
[605.81] That's why I asked you
to come in the morning.
[608.66] I can't thank you enough, 
thanks a lot auntie.
[611.25] But don't expect it from me every time.
[614.95] Sure, I understand.
[617.63] I always try to keep her happy but some
issue raises from somewhere every time.
[623.94] Try to avoid it next time.
[627.02] If God wills.
[645.49] Faiq is such a rude and ignorant person.
[648.48] Mama, I can't tell you, his mother is
nothing in compared to Faiq's cleverness.
[653.12] My fate is ruined. 
Oh, God where did I get married.
[657.72] Listen madam, why are you blaming God now?
[662.29] His nature tried it's best that
you don't jump into this hell.
[667.96] But you were your own enemy.
[672.66] You always thing I am the one who is wrong.
[677.51] Because you have committed this mistake.
[679.28] And I am the one facing
consequences for that
[680.83] through my husband
and thorough his sister.
[686.99] All you care is about yourself. 
Is anybody concerned about me too or not?
[691.32] There is a limit of being concerned, Nosheen.
[696.21] You come home crying
and wailing every other day.
[699.73] If you have married by your
own choice then try to cope now.
[704.38] Fine, I won't come here ever again.
[706.91] Okay, listen, just listen to me.
[710.52] Nosheen, we'll do something. Don't worry.
[714.47] -What are you going to do?
-I will talk to your father.
[718.10] When are you going to do that? Faiq
and his mother's rudeness have exceeded.
[724.67] There has been enough cruelty
on me, I can't take it anymore.
[729.03] Nosheen, now have a little patience.
[731.10] No, Mama, please talk to Dad 
to set them straight.
[737.06] What's going on here?
[739.61] Look, Azmat, my daughter is
going through such a bad time.
[745.92] See, they have held her like a hostage.
[749.62] See how she has lost weight and she
has got dark circles under her eyes too.
[759.04] Please talk to them so that they
don't dare to do anything to her again.
[771.91] You were a little unhappy with her
[773.12] and they thought of her 
as she doesn't have any backing.
[775.42] It doesn't make any difference
to me what they have thought
[777.74] and how they are treating her.
[779.44] thinking that she has no backing,
doesn't make any difference to me.
[783.50] If she has taken such a huge step,
she can handle her own matters too.
[787.59] Tell her clearly that if
she want to come here
[789.81] she should leave all her problems behind.
[792.62] No need to disturb the peace of my house.
[795.61] WE are going at Farhana's for dinner,
get ready on time, we shouldn't get late.
[801.95] He is right, Mama.
[804.00] He broke all my hopes.
[807.05] This is what's going to happen to me.
[810.58] If my own father 
is behaving with me like this,
[813.53] then the world is going to mistreat me too.
[817.38] Your dad is just angry, but he
really cares about you, Nosheen.
[822.73] Just stop it, Mama, I know how everyone is.
[836.45] -Isn't Aima ready yet?
-She is just coming, brother.
[839.51] -And where is Zaid and Zoya?
-I don't know, I didn't ask.
[845.10] If you haven't asked then go and ask them.
[846.64] It doesn't mean that if one is
invited to someone's place for dinner
[848.54] one should reach right
at the time of dinner.
[850.70] We have to get sweets on our way too.
[852.38] -He has come himself.
-Isn't Zoya ready yet?
[857.29] Zoya isn't coming.
[858.61] Not coming? What do you
mean, everything all right?
[861.15] Yes, actually she isn't feeling well, so...
[865.17] If she isn't well you should
have told us that before.
[870.31] We could have called 
her mother here at least.
[872.29] How are we going to
leave her at home alone?
[875.07] It's okay, Dad. She will stay alone.
[877.69] She can stay, but we have
some responsibility too.
[880.43] How can we leave her home like that?
[883.15] Brother, it's okay, you guys
go ahead, I'll stay back with her.
[888.12] Let me call Amber and ask her.
[890.41] Ask her, it would be better if she arrives.
[893.53] Okay do one thing, Zaid
and Aima you guys go ahead.
[897.45] We will come after Amber arrives.
[901.14] Yeah, go on.
[902.50] And you ask Zoya if she wants to wait till
Amber arrives or shall we drop her there.
[907.83] -Okay let me ask her.
-Yeah, go find out
[927.28] Faiq.
[931.33] What's happened? Everything all right?
[934.38] Nothing, mom.
[936.42] Then why are you sitting here?
[938.81] -Just like that.
-Did you have breakfast?
[942.46] No.
[944.74] -Where is Nosheen?
-I don't know.
[948.27] What is the problem with you two, Faiq?
[951.96] You both were fighting so much even
last night, there was so much noise.
[958.55] Is this a good thing to fight like that?
[960.63] I don't know,I am fed up
myself with these fights everyday.
[964.49] Then why are you prolonging
this matter? Find a solution.
[968.04] Mother, this girl has lost her
mind. It's no use talking to her.
[971.75] What do you mean Faiq?
[973.39] Means all this is going to
go on like this all your life?
[976.92] I don't know.
[978.49] Faiq, find out the root cause 
of the fight between you two.
[985.29] You both have married 
each other by your own choice,
[987.88] then why so many differences suddenly?
[992.04] As far as I am concerned,
[993.99] I have always tried not
to interfere in your matter.
[997.88] Mom, I just don't get it
[1001.84] But in the past few months
this girl has driven me crazy.
[1007.58] She has such a childish attitude.
[1010.04] She thinks of life as party time.
[1016.40] If you go out for shopping, or eat out or
keep going places then everything is fine.
[1024.57] And if any of it doesn't happen
then she starts behaving weirdly.
[1027.29] And you know what, she is after me
[1030.96] that because his brother and Zoya are
going on a honeymoon so we should go too.
[1036.98] And I have told her that if they are going
it isn't necessary that we should go too.
[1043.97] And she is fighting with me after
that. She isn't listening to me at all.
[1048.25] Faiq, that girl always 
had a childish mentality.
[1054.83] But she is your choice. 
You made this decision yourself.
[1059.54] And one one takes a decision, 
one should own it too.
[1066.66] Okay, just listen, no need to be so sad.
[1071.99] There isn't an understanding in
every relation since the beginning.
[1074.82] You have to give it some time.
[1076.21] Just sit with her, talk to her
and find a solution the problem.
[1080.89] -Mom, can I ask you something?
-Sure.
[1086.60] Are you still angry with me?
[1089.94] Time heals every wound, dear.
[1093.85] It's your life.
[1096.60] Whatever decision you have
taken for it must be better.
[1105.51] Okay, just wait, 
I'll get breakfast for you.
[1118.41] Faiq I'm crying because I
am going to be married soon.
[1128.18] I will be moving to your home.
[1132.18] Zoya's farewell reminded me of my farewell.
[1141.56] That's why I got emotional.
[1144.35] -Are you sure that is just it?
-Why would I hide anything from you?
[1148.36] No, I'm not worried.
[1150.47] I just came to say that if there
is anything you share it with me.
[1155.02] Anything that you want to
discuss with me, I'm there.
[1158.85] Faiq, I didn't get what
you are trying to say.
[1162.07] Aima, I think you are
hiding something from me.
[1164.70] Why would I hide anything from you?
[1166.75] I have noticed that you are pretty
disturbed during the whole wedding.
[1170.70] And I didn't think of it as normal.
[1172.31] I just told you that Zoya's farewell
reminded me of my farewell.
[1180.73] I got teary just to think about the fact
that I am going to miss them all so much.
[1190.31] The people in this house,
the time spent here, my family.
[1198.40] That girl kept saying nonsense
and you kept listening quietly?
[1203.33] Tell me, is that recording all true?
[1208.74] Have you been meeting her privately?
Talking to her secretly?
[1215.03] Tell me, Faiq, I want to
hear the truth from you.
[1220.67] It's true, mother.
[1225.07] I don't like Aima but Nosheen, 
and want to get married to Nosheen too.
[1229.45] And you are telling me this now?
[1233.19] When you are here to marry Aima?
[1238.19] You have disgraced me, Faiq.
[1242.36] I have promised Shabana
and brother Azmat
[1245.47] that my son isn't going
to decline what I ask.
[1250.76] You have been fooling me.
[1255.57] You should have told
me if you didn't like Aima.
[1260.32] I would have called off this marriage.
[1263.52] But that poor girl's life wouldn't
have been ruined like this.
[1268.42] You have no idea about 
the consequences of what you have done.
[1286.60] I have told the driver, he will
drop you guys to the airport.
[1290.63] You guys? Who else is coming with me?
[1293.13] Aima is going with you.
[1295.05] I have made you hotel reservations and asked
Mr. Sheikh to arrange a car for you too.
[1300.09] You guys can move around and
enjoy after the meeting, all right?
[1304.48] I'll just be back.
[1306.50] There is not much time
left before the flight leaves.
[1308.56] -I'll be right back.
-Okay.
[1316.99] Now go for what you were
going, there is just an hour left.
[1321.60] No, Dad, it's not needed anymore.
[1324.66] Okay, fine. Durrani, put
this luggage in the car.
[1328.69] Okay, son, may God be with you.
Come on. Take care of your self.
[1373.42] Who is it?
[1376.48] I'm busy right now, you can
come and do the cleaning later.
[1382.58] Oh, man! What the hell.
[1393.88] Oh, mom, did you want something?
Faiq has already left.
[1398.88] I know, but I want something from you.
[1401.55] From me? Everything all right?
[1404.65] Can I come in? I have to talk to you.
[1408.67] Yes, sure please come in, sit down.
[1417.33] Please sit.
[1426.74] You guys have been
married just for a few days
[1429.92] and you guys fight with
each other on every little thing.
[1432.44] That's not a nice thing.
[1434.41] You must be happy, 
isn't that what you wanted?
[1441.35] Why? Why should I be happy?
[1444.86] Because your son didn't
marry your beloved one.
[1449.44] Nosheen, I have told you so many times
that all that was with Faiq's own will.
[1454.35] I have never imposed my will on him.
[1459.70] Anyway, what's done is done.
[1462.78] But now you both are husband and wife.
[1465.15] And you both should spend your
lives with love and understanding.
[1469.92] Understanding? That can only happen
when you are going to let that happen.
[1474.15] Why? Why wouldn't I want it?
[1479.68] Every mother wants that
her children stay happy.
[1483.12] And I love Faiq a lot.
[1485.98] Every mother loves her child the
same, you don't do anything new.
[1494.67] You are absolutely right, 
this is how a mother is.
[1501.52] Okay, now forget everything 
and come with me.
[1504.22] I am going to help you in the kitchen and
you can make something of Faiq's choice.
[1508.96] He'll get happy.
[1511.12] Thank you so much, but please excuse me.
[1514.43] If your kitchen gets dirty again
you will poison Faiq against me again.
[1519.62] What is the way your are
talking to me, Nosheen?
[1524.28] Why would I do that?
[1526.15] I have told you I don't want to do
anything which may hurt my son.
[1531.31] I just want to see him happy.
[1534.19] I have told you, it's my final decision
that I won't enter the kitchen now.
[1538.00] Now you may leave.
[1585.70] Where are we going? What happened?
[1588.05] -For shopping.
-Why?
[1595.25] Zaid! I just told you that we
are going for shopping
[1596.34] because I talked to mama and she said
that we should keep warm clothes with us.
[1599.68] I have mine, but I think
you don't have any.
[1602.17] So, let's go for shopping. 
Shall we go right now?
[1608.12] Zaid, is there a problem?
[1613.70] -Hmm.
-Hmm , again?
[1617.13] Tell me, what happened?
[1621.34] Zoya,
[1624.15] we
[1628.04] are not going on the trip.
[1635.36] -Wait, Zoya.
-Leave my hand.
[1639.18] Zoya, just try to understand
me, at least listen to me.
[1643.43] Zaid, I don't want to
listen to anything you say.
[1645.47] Zoya, I swear it's not my fault, 
I compelled to.
[1650.40] You may stay compelled for life.
[1652.88] Zoya, I'm really sorry,
please try to understand.
[1657.04] I said leave my hand.
[1661.15] Zoya!
[1662.72] Zoya, what have you decided then?
[1668.04] I don't know, Mom.
[1671.80] But you have to choose any one of them.
[1676.90] I made up my mind for
Daniyal after thinking so much.
[1680.19] And now Zaid has come in between.
[1682.03] My brain is just messed up.
[1684.28] But you have to take a decision.
[1688.97] I will need some time.
[1691.78] I can't take a decision in such haste.
[1697.55] But you have to, Zoya.
[1700.65] Just give me some time.
[1703.71] The problem is that the boy's
family is visiting tomorrow.
[1707.64] And if you choose Zaid, I am not
calling them just to have dinner with us.
[1713.59] Two heroes have entered
my life at once in my life.
[1717.53] Idiot, your hero is going
to be any one of them.
[1723.89] Mom, you have met Daniyal too and Zaid too.
[1728.31] If I ask you to think, 
whose side will you be one?
[1736.82] It's difficult.
[1738.91] See!
[1740.13] I was just asking you and
you have given up just now.
[1745.45] It's the question of my life.
[1795.55] Don't you dare bring my
daughter, Nosheen, between all this.
[1801.89] I won't tolerate.
[1803.61] You mother and daughter
always bring Nosheen in between.
[1806.83] Oh, God!
[1809.23] Auntie, please leave
before I lose my temper.
[1813.11] Oh, so you are going to
kick me out of my own house?
[1817.20] This is my house and you
should keep that in your mind.
[1823.27] You are supposed to tie it like that, okay?
[1826.92] Nice watch. Come on let's go, hurry up.
[1829.64] -Get up.
-Okay.
[1834.17] You won't give up like that. I'll just give
your number to cybercrime department.
[1838.29] Nosheen!
[1840.54] -Who?
-It's me, Faisal.
