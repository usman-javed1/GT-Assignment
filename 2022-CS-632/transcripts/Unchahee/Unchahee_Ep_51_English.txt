From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you Mother, this girl has lost
her mind, it's nothing else. Faiq, if she is saying it
with so much confidence, there must be something that she felt. Mother, it's nothing like that.
And you know Sania very well. Anyway, you aren't that naive. Look, whatever you want to say, if
you'll say it clearly it would be better. Your son is having an affair with a
girl and you aren't even aware of that? Salman there's this thing,
people are right, life isn't easy. Stop it, man. You have been
talking philosophy since so long. Life isn't that difficult. We are much better than many
others. You should be thankful. You are right. And I have just one suggestion for you now. That do whatever you feel happy about. -Are you happy?
-Me? Where did my happiness come in this? I know that your decision is right, but I don't know why, I am a little
worried regarding this relationship. I can understand what you're trying to say. Look, brother, please don't mind, but I
have no enmity with anyone. There is good and bad in every person. but I have a doubt that sister will never accept Aima as
the daughter in law of this family. Excuse me, doctor!
How is dad doing now? Look, I won't say that
there is nothing wrong because his ECG didn't come out right. We sent his Troponin I test as well,
which came out increased too. Which means that he had his
heart attack because of this factor too. And its intensity is too much as well. -Is he critical?
-Yes. He is in a very critical position. We are giving him treatment, and thank
God that you guys brought him in on time. Doctor, will he be all right? With God's will. Just pray. We are doing some more tests on him.
We'll let you know if we require anything. By the way how is the patient's lifestyle? I mean does he consume oily food much? Or anything which he
is not supposed to take? No, doctor, dad's lifestyle is very
healthy, he takes healthy food only. In fact he goes for morning walk
and at times does exercise too. That's good. Doctor, what may be the cause
of dad's heart attack? -Where does he work?
-He has a business. According to his medical history
it's not supposed to be like that. May be he has taken some kind of stress. Because of which he has build up
a pressure on himself. Or maybe some symptoms showed up
because of which he had a heart attack. No doubt that this is a big decision. I pray to God that may this
decision be beneficial for you. Dad, I hope you don't have any objection. What objection can I have? -I mean, I hope you won't get angry.
-No, not at all. At times, mental stress can cause it too. -But don't worry, we're trying our best.
-Thank you, doctor. Thank you. Zaid, be brave, please. What could have
caused dad's stress, Aima? Everything is going to
be fine. please be brave. Obviously, this must happen. You guys give so much stress to dad. Whoever it is, comes and creates a drama. Who are you talking about, Nosheen? I am saying what I am observing. Now if someone wants to take
the blame then it's up to them. Nosheen, your dad is at the hospital
right now, and in a very critical state. It would be better if you just stop
this nonsense and pray for him. I know what I need to do.
No need to teach me. Oh, what are you arguing about? Mama, why don't you say
something to your sister? Stop it Nosheen. By the way, if anything happens to dad
then there is going to be a huge problem. What are you saying, Nosheen?
Are you in your senses? I am right mama, if anything
happens to dad then... he hasn't even written his will yet. Our home will turn into a battleground. Stop it, Nosheen,
what nonsense are you saying? Mama, I'm telling you the reality. If anything happens to dad right now then brother Hammad will
be the first to claim his share. Zaid is no less, and what do you think,
will Aima and her mother leave their share? Don't know if we will get anything or not. May God have mercy. Now, I don't want that this happens, but a person should at least
think from every aspect, mama. What kind of a child are you who
is talking about his father's death? Mama, you get emotional at everything. I am just saying in general, don't
people have deaths in their homes? Nosheen, just pray for your
dad that he returns safely. Oh, so that's the case. Means whenever
you want to have a treat you think of me. I think that you are taking all the
revenge from school days from me now. Oh, nevermind, the doors of my
restaurant are always open for you. Obviously, you don't need
to say it. Anything for you. Hey, did you watch that
movie which I recommended? Just watch it, it's such
a nice movie, yeah. Yes, mother, anything you want? Okay, I'll call you back. Bye. -Yes, mother, what is it?
-Faiq, how is Mr. Azmat doing now? I don't know, mother. Faiq, why don't you know? Didn't you call Nosheen or Zaid? No, I just went to drop Nosheen. Faiq, this is very wrong. Your in laws are supposed
to be your second family. As much you are a member of this
house, as much you are of that house too. And because of Nosheen,
you are the son of that family. You should support them
in this difficult time. This chatting, phone calls,
all this can happen later too. Right now you should be
aware of your responsibility. You should help Zaid. Okay, fine. If you say, I'll go there. Even if I don't tell you, you
should realize it yourself. Faiq, relationships are always two-ways. One should not expect
from the girl only that she shall compromise
only take care of everyone. A boy shall be as considerate as her. And he should own
the girl and her family sincerely. Only then one can carve a
space in each other's hearts. Of course. You are wise enough yourself. Go and see how Mr. Azmat is doing
and then tell me about it. Okay, mother, sure. Don't know what the issue is,
mom. He is not even picking my call. Shabana was telling that there is an issue
with the network signals at the hospital. Even Aima isn't receiving her calls. If he knows that there is
an issue with network there then why can't he come
out and check his phone? But what do he care about me?
Aima must be with him there. Then why don't you go to
the hospital in place of Aima? -Me?
-Yes. Can't you go there? Mom, uncle is his maternal uncle. And she loves him like his real dad. And even uncle considers
her as her own daughter. She is her niece, but your
relation is no less than hers. He is your auntie's husband
and now your father in law too. -But still, mom.
-Didn't I tell you this is the time to win Zaid's heart. Go to Zaid. Go to the
hospital as his daughter in law. Support Zaid. Stand by him. I think you're right. I should go. Tell me one thing, whenever Zaid is tensed
why does he go to Aima? Think about it. Because they both are very good friends. No, because he gets
relieved when he goes to Aima. And that's the truth. It's Aima's wisdom
that she has made Zaid used to her. By supporting him in every problem. Remember one thing, dear, a man is always looking for peace. He wants to go to such a woman
where he can find his peace. No to someone who keeps
giving him tensions in any form. That's why, you go to Zaid. Get ready. I'll get something
made to eat, you can take it for Zaid. And listen, don't say anything there
which may make him tensed. Okay, mom. Thank God, Faiq, you're here. I was getting so worried, didn't
know who to share my problems with. I'm really worried about dad. You know, doctors have almost lost hope. Nosheen, no need to worry.
I am coming from the hospital. Zaid has told me that uncle is doing
fine now. He is just under observation. -Really?
-Yes. He can meet his family in a few hours. Okay, I'll go and inform
the rest of the family. I think Zaid has already told it to auntie. Oh, okay. You know, I haven't been out of my
room at all, just reciting Quran for him. -I came to meet you.
-Thank you so much, Faiq. You have so much consideration for my pain. Okay just wait, I'll get
something made for you to eat. No, I have already eaten. I just have a little headache
so please get me a cup of tea. -Okay, I'll tell them to make it.
-Thank you. Hello. Hello? Who is this? -Hello, who are you?
-You called, whom do you want to talk? Actually I was calling my friend, but I
guess I have dialed a wrong number. Please try not to repeat
this mistake, thank you. What's up? Did someone call? Yeah, some wrong number. You have around 45 calls from
this number in your call log. Who is he? Oh, one of those cheap guys who have nothing else to do,
so they call people to tease them. But you never told me about it. I wasn't so important
that I should have told you. It's just a wrong number, forget it. DO one thing, give this number to me. I have a friend in police, I'll
ask him to check who this guy is. Just forget it, Faiq, no need for all
that. I'm just going to block him directly. Besides, there are a hundred
other tensions, so what's the use? See, I've done it. Tea must be ready by
now, let me get it for you. You must be tired. No, I'm fine. See, I'm back. I didn't feel like staying home. And you'll see uncle
will recover very soon. Have you eaten since morning? How can one think of
eating in such a situation? Okay, come one, let's eat something. Come. I'll be there in a while. Aima, why don't you go
home? Take some rest. I'm here with Zaid. I'm not going anywhere leaving dad behind. Dad, isn't alone. We are here with him. I told you, I am not going
anywhere without taking dad with me. Dad is... inside the room. And you are out here with Zaid. Why don't you say that you
don't want to leave Zaid alone? Driver is waiting outside,
you go home and take rest. Besides, your mother is really worried too. Go and console her a little. Dad! Dad, how are you doing now? Dad, I got really worried
after knowing about your health. But, thank God you seem much better to me. You will recover soon with God's will. Actually, brother, doctors
have forbidden dad to talk. I know. Dad is unhappy with me. And he should be too. I deserve it on what I did. I have hurt you so much. Brother, we'll talk
about these things later. You're right. A lot of time is
required for these things. Take care of yourself, Dad. We need you so much, Dad. How dare you step
foot in my home? Aunty, I want to talk to Zoya. Zoya doesn't want to talk
to you, now go from here. -Zoya, please listen to me just once.
-No! Mom, let her speak. I want
to know what she has to say. Zoya, believe me, I never
wanted this to happen. Really? But still it has happened, Aima. Just try to understand,
Zoya, I had no fault in it. You had no fault in it, Zaid had
no fault in it, I think it was my fault. Your marriage was called off, Faiq
cheated on you, your life was ruined. So why did you punish me for that? Why do I have to bear all this? Besides, you didn't lose anything. If Faiq left you then
Zaid got married to you. Is this what love is? This wasn't love, it was my compulsion. Nobody is compelled to do so. To make your own livelihood,
you ruined mine, Aima. No, Zoya, that's not true. 
Why would I want to harm you? -You are my friend, like my sister.
-Don;t you get tried of saying such things? This friendship, love, it's nothing. The only thing true in this world is to think about yourself and
think of your own welfare. -No, Zoya, I...
-Enough, enough. Zoya, you go to your room. This girl is too clever. She is just trying to wheedle you
with her innocence to take you back. I'm not a child, Mom. I know who
is my friend and who is my enemy. And now I know it very well. You know, Aima, I had read it in stories only that
your friends stab you in your back. But today I have seen it too. Sorry, Mom, you were right when you said that I
dam unable to recognize how others are. I made a mistake. And thank you, Aima, for
giving me this experience. And this is what you
are being punished for. Now you see? Your love, your husband,
and she, your best friend both of them have done
such a huge fraud with you. Both of them proved to be such frauds. Zoya, please believe me, whatever that has happened, none of
us have done it happily or with our will. Madam Aima, a marriage can't
take place without anybody's will. And this marriage included yours and Zaid's
will, that’s why all this could happen. The only cause do to so was my mother. If I hadn't gotten married that night, my
mother wouldn't have been able to bear it. I have bought my mother's life 
by getting married to Zaid. Zoya, I know that I have hurt you a lot and I am going to be
your culprit all my life. Aima, I just don't understand
what you are trying to prove? Do you want us to think
that you are innocent? Or shall we celebrate all this?
Tell me, what is it? No, I don't want anything like that. Then what the hell do
you want from both of us? I just want Zoya to return home
and forgive me and Zaid. Which friend? I have invited Sania. What? The same Sania whom you were taking
selfies with getting too close to her? What if he minds it when he finds out. What are you saying?
Which home? Whose son? What does he has to do with
the problems of this home? He has left this home, Zaid. Now you guys should
prepare yourself to run around. Sister, brother Azmat, you both
are going to be grand parents. Yes, my Zoya is expecting.
