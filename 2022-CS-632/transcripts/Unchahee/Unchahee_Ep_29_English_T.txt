[0.00] From flowers and from buds
[4.54] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.13] When I saw you
[14.07] I learned how to chirp from you
[18.64] Zaid, I think, auntie is forcing Zaid
to marry me, he doesn't like me.
[26.14] Nosheen, everything all right?
You called so early in the morning?
[28.35] Yeah, actually I was getting bored,
so I thought of calling you.
[32.46] Mom, I'm going to Dubai for a shoot.
[36.91] Dubai?
[38.78] Your dad has given permission
for you to join college again.
[44.54] Really?
[45.52] I have booked an apartment for Aima.
[51.95] And I've opened a bank
account for her personal use.
[55.76] So, these are all the documents for those.
[63.35] Mr. Azmat tell me, are you
saying all that in your senses?
[68.04] What is it that I said that you
are taunting me about my senses?
[71.67] You are telling me that you are going to
spend all your money on this mother daughter.
[74.97] When did I say that?
[76.47] I'm giving Aima
what I planned to give Nosheen.
[79.79] Just stop it. Till when are you going
to use Nosheen as an excuse?
[85.15] Nosheen hasn't even got a single pence yet.
[87.28] What ever Nosheen is done
is her own fault. Or else I was...
[90.75] When a child sees her father being close
to strangers then she gets rebellious.
[95.86] Aima is not a stranger!
[98.38] Oh yes she is more close to you than us.
[101.66] That's why you are favoring her with
fists full of gold, this is what proves it.
[107.05] Why don't you do one thing, take some
money from me too and spend it on her.
[112.47] What are you talking about? Whatever is
mine will be my children's after me.
[117.28] Mr. Azmat, they both won't let a penny
remaining in your pocket until you are alive.
[123.22] Lower your voice, what is Shabana listens?
[126.03] I'm not scared of anyone.
[127.49] I'm going to say the same in
front of them what I'm saying to you.
[132.02] They both have robbed us,
both of them are robbers.
[135.75] I'm telling you to lower your voice!
My sister is a heart patient.
[140.87] Your sister doesn't have a problem
with her heart, she has a problem of greed.
[143.94] Since she is here,
[145.34] she has been asking money for her daughter's
studies, or her medical treatment,
[147.06] and now they are using the wedding
as an excuse to mint money.
[150.61] Enough!
[153.11] You have spilled enough venom
against Shabana and Aima.
[157.91] I haven't seen a cheaper woman
than you in my life.
[160.89] Yeah, go ahead and look at your sister,
[163.70] and when you're done
with her then go look at her child.
[166.42] Now just stop spitting
this venom, do you hear?
[170.29] Or else I'm not going
to stop you by just telling you.
[192.23] It's 9:00 pm, auntie,
when will she be back?
[195.08] She must be coming.
[198.36] Seriously, I'm getting worried now.
[200.90] No, no, don't get worried. She often
goes for shopping and gets late...
[206.29] That's okay, but at least
she should pick up my call.
[209.35] Oh, hello! What a surprise!
[213.71] Where have you been, Zoya?
I've been waiting for you for so long.
[217.09] You must have listened to the saying
[222.28] Good things come to those
who wait, right Mom?
[225.79] That's okay but you could have called
and informed, man.
[229.52] Calm down, Zaid, why are you getting angry
on such a small issue?
[234.43] I'm not getting angry. Just look
at the time, I've been calling you for so long.
[238.47] Zoya, you go and get freshen up.
[241.81] And, Zaid, go wash your hands,
I'll get dinner served.
[245.85] No, auntie, I'll go home and have dinner.
[248.39] Come on, I'm just getting it served. Just
take a look, if you feel like you can have it.
[264.45] What is your problem?
[266.51] My problem? Seriously?
[268.95] What is your problem, Zoya?
[270.68] I've been waiting for you here leaving
everything, for the past four hours.
[274.69] I'm sorry, Zaid, but I didn't ask you
to sit here and wait for me.
[278.64] And besides, if you were getting late,
you should have left.
[282.71] -Look at your tone you are using with me.
-Look at your tone.
[286.32] Besides, nobody has talked to me like this.
[289.25] And that too in front of my mom.
[292.61] -Look, I was just concerned.
-You weren't concerned, you very being rude.
[297.42] What is this, Zoya?
You have been out for so long.
[302.18] And what is this attitude that
whenever you feel like you go
[304.00]  and when you feel you'll get back.
[305.29] Try to be a little responsible, man.
[307.01] Zaid, don't try to become my husband.
[314.69] What do you mean?
[316.12] That you will become my husband,
you aren't my husband yet.
[322.83] Fine, do whatever you like.
[337.56] You are telling us to exclude from the
house and you think I'm going to like it?
[342.96] What are you talking about?
[344.87] Mr. Azmat tell me, are you
saying all that in your senses?
[349.65] What is it that I said that you
are taunting me about my senses?
[353.22] You are telling me that you are going to
spend all your money on this mother daughter.
[356.37] I'm giving Aima
what I planned to give Nosheen.
[390.60] Dad,
[395.37] is everything okay?
[399.30] How did you know that I'm here?
[401.89] Aima told me. She was
really worried
[403.85] and said that you got angry
and went away from home.
[409.89] -What happened, Dad?
-Just forget it.
[414.58] Your mother has never given me comfort.
[420.91] And remember, those
who can comfort others
[425.25] they remain restless
all their lives as well.
[429.93] But, Dad, tell me what the issue is,
I'll talk to mama.
[435.12] That's what I'm angry about.
[437.49] That she has made an issue of a non-issue.
[440.86] But, Dad, till when are you going to
stay here? It's so late, come home with me.
[444.38] No, I don't want to go home.
[449.24] I find peace here.
[453.91] How sad it is,
[457.03] that I find peace everywhere
other than my home.
[463.17] Other men go to their homes
so that they find peace and I...
[473.31] I get out of my home looking for peace.
[478.33] -Dad, why is our family dynamic like that?
-Family.
[485.19] The family, dear.
[490.43] A family is because of a woman.
[496.31] There are some qualities in a woman
which change a house to a home.
[501.94] What qualities?
[506.20] Which my wife and your mother lacks.
[512.57] Tolerance and the ability to listen.
[516.94] I absolutely don't mean
[520.69] that the husband should
be cruel to his wife.
[528.72] Be unfair to her.
[531.48] It's a man's duty to love and
respect his wife as much as he can.
[537.79] Gives her all her rights.
[542.29] So that in times of distress
the woman stands by her husband.
[547.07] Be a source of his peace.
[550.66] Instead of arguing with her
on his every decision.
[555.07] Because if a woman
isn't able to listen or tolerate
[559.40] then the house gets in a state
[563.75] in which our house is.
[567.45] Do you get it, Zaid?
[570.83] Yes, Dad, I understand.
[575.08] That's the reason that I came here
from home to find peace.
[580.88] Came here and sat.
[583.68] Just try to learn from my experience
and save yourself from agony.
[617.03] Zaid, I've been waiting
for you for so long,
[619.59] and you have come out
of your room just now.
[622.39] What is it? Did you want something?
[623.88] Zaid, what is this childish behaviour?
Why are you two fighting with each other?
[628.07] Aima, please don't take her side
in front of me.
[630.36] Zaid, I'm not taking anyone's side, I'm just
asking why are you two fighting like kids?
[636.54] This isn't fighting like kids.
It's a genuine issue.
[639.60] She must understand, it's her fault.
[642.61] Look, if you want to make
someone realize their mistake,
[646.05]  this is not the way to do it
how you are doing it.
[648.68] I haven't done anything, Aima.
[650.86] It's her fault.
[652.69] First of all she left without informing me,
[655.00] I kept calling her
and she kept disconnecting.
[657.54] And when I tried to talk
to her she started arguing.
[662.87] You want me to leave all this behind
and apologize to her?
[665.54] But why?
[667.69] You know, I left her house
after being angry last night.
[672.33] She is supposed to call me in principle,
[674.72] she should ask how I'm doing
and solve this issue.
[677.74] Let alone calling she didn't
even send me a message.
[681.15] Aima, what sort of stubbornness is this
[682.44] that she commits a mistake
and then doesn't even apologize.
[684.65] I apologize right away when I'm at fault.
I even go to her place to appease her.
[690.22] It may be possible that she is
expecting you to contact him.
[694.36] If she has committed a mistake,
she has to apologize too.
[696.63] Now she may call me
or come home to apologize.
[701.26] And I'm sure she must have called you
after what happened last night.
[704.48] And she must have told
you her made-up version
[706.23] because of which you
are talking in her favor.
[708.36] I'm not talking in anyone's favor.
[710.46] I'm not taking anybody's side.
[714.18] I just want to know that there are
just a few days left in your marriage.
[720.09] Please end your fight.
[722.05] Till when are you going
to stick with your egos
[724.43] and expect that
the other one will apologize.
[727.70] Look, things won't proceed this way.
[731.61] I know, Aima, in other words you
mean that I should give up in front of her.
[735.79] I'm sorry that's never going to happen.
[739.60] Oh, for God's sake, Zaid, where did
this giving up or surrendering come from?
[744.45] This isn't a battle.
[746.12] She is going to become
your wife in a few days.
[748.59] If you are going to say sorry to her,
what's the big deal in it?
[752.52] Initiating in saying sorry
is a sign of wise people.
[755.58] I'm sorry neither I want to become wise,
nor I am wise.
[758.67] And please don't force me.
[760.57] Fine, if you have decided,
what am I doing here?
[768.89] They both have become a pain.
[779.40] Man, I love the logo.
The design is excellent.
[782.14] I think that our restaurant will be
the most prominent one on the whole street.
[785.50] Do one thing, just complete
all your preparations.
[787.86] I want to do the
opening in next week.
[792.05] Yeah, don't worry about that.
I have talked to the chef.
[794.72] And fix my meeting with Mr. Safdar,
I'm free tomorrow, okay?
[802.22] Okay, carry on with your working.
We'll talk tomorrow.
[805.20] And listen, did you receive
the bank transaction?
[809.29] Good, okay see you. Bye.
[821.18] Nosheen, what are you doing here?
[824.34] Faiq I wanted to talk to you about something
important that's why I had to come.
[829.43] You shouldn't have come here.
Mom isn't home either.
[833.16] I know, that's why I'm here.
[836.40] You know, if someone sees us,
it's going to be really bad.
[840.14] Now please, go from here.
[841.68] Faiq, just listen to me, I have to
talk to you about something important.
[845.49] What is so important
that you want to talk about?
[850.04] And look, we don't have
any such relationship
[852.51] that we talk about important
things in private like this.
[854.95] We have a relationship, Faiq.
[856.56] And it is something which is
supposed to be done in private.
[861.53] Try to understand, it's very important.
[863.99] This important thing could have
been done over the phone too.
[865.89]  You didn't need to come here.
[867.51] Why are you doing this to me, Faiq?
[871.88] Nosheen, please, back off.
[876.16] Faiq, I'm really helpless,
please just listen to me.
[878.72] I don't want to listen
to anything. Get lost!
[893.66] Okay, Nosheen, relax.
[896.86] Stop crying, come here, come in please.
[906.04] Sit here.
[911.34] Look, Nosheen, try to understand.
[916.79] If the maid tell mother,
it's going to be a problem.
[921.08] I'm getting married in a few days.
[923.36] And you being here is very harmful for me.
[927.59] I would have said
what I had to say and left long ago.
[930.07] It's you who is getting angry at me.
[933.02] Okay, I'm sorry.
[937.47] Try to understand my position.
[941.83] Tell me, what is it?
What do you want to say?
[944.13] Look, Faiq, whatever I'm going to tell you,
[947.75] first promise me that you
won't tell that to anyone.
[951.80] And you won't even get angry with me.
[954.75] Will you tell me what is it?
[957.03] Faiq, try to understand,
this isn't some random issue.
[962.12] Promise me that you won't break
your friendship with me either.
[966.52] Can you say what you want to say clearly?
[975.26] Okay, okay, promise.
[978.45] I won't get angry and I won't
break my friendship with you.
[982.06] Now tell me, relax, tell me what it is?
[991.93] Faiq, Faiq, I love you.
[999.84] I really love you.
[1001.47] I want to marry you.
[1011.14] You went with so much confidence, what
happened then? Your friend didn't agree?
[1016.10] I had told you already,
I know her very well.
[1019.23] When she gets stubborn about anything
[1020.43] she doesn't listen to
anyone, no matter if it's you.
[1024.03] What are you trying to say, Zaid?
[1026.72] I'm just trying to say that this
isn't as simple as you think it is.
[1031.99] One of you needs to break the ice.
[1036.59] If she wanted to do that
she would have done it long ago.
[1040.42] -One thing's for sure.
-What?
[1043.90] I'm not going to apologize.
[1045.68] Specially when she has no regrets
over what she has done.
[1048.89] You both are making a huge mistake.
[1051.04] I know. I have an idea.
[1053.15] In fact I am starting to believe
this idea with every passing day
[1057.11] that I'm going to commit a huge
mistake by getting married to Zoya.
[1062.21] Zaid, are you out of your mind?
[1064.46] This isn't a joke that if
you don't like it with one girl
[1067.10]  you go looking for another one.
[1074.78] -I know, man.
-No, you don't!
[1078.61] I thought that you have
gotten mature, but no,
[1084.68] you are still mentally stuck in university.
[1088.26] You fall in love with someone for four days
[1089.89] and then get bored with
her on the fifth, right?
[1092.38] It's not like that.
[1098.14] -What do you want?
-I don't think this relationship is going to work.
[1103.75] It's a mistake.
[1105.48] Do you have an idea what you are saying?
[1109.75] Just two weeks, there are just
two weeks left in your wedding.
[1113.48] All the arrangements
have been done,
[1114.98] and you two are quarreling
over just a small thing...
[1120.74] You know what?
[1123.72] I am crazy, I'm out of my senses to
try to make peace between you two.
[1128.51] If you two don't even want to talk to
each other, why am I wasting my time?
[1133.76] -Aima, try to understand.
-No, you try to understand, Zaid.
[1138.95] This isn't a joke.
[1143.20] Okay, fine, I agree that Zoya is stubborn,
[1145.39] but sorry to say you don't
like to compromise either.
[1150.14] If you think this marriage won't work
then go ahead, end it.
[1154.43] I'll be spared with this everyday
tension. I'm sick of you both.
[1157.90] Aima, listen to me, Aima, listen. Aima!
[1178.43] Nosheen, how can this be?
[1181.45] It's done now, I really like you.
[1185.05] I don't think you know
what you're talking about.
[1188.60] I know, Faiq what I'm talking about.
[1190.62] If you don't believe it
you can hear it once again.
[1194.46] No, you can't say anything
like this being in your senses.
[1199.89] I'm saying it after giving
it a lot of thought, Faiq.
[1203.00] I just had to tell you this.
[1206.36] I have gathered so much courage
to come here and tell you the truth.
[1210.92] You know, if your families get
to know about it they are going to kill us.
[1216.42] Rather, nothing is going to happen
to you but I'll be doomed.
[1218.94] I don't care. Just tell me what you think.
[1224.19] No, this can't happen. Impossible.
[1228.20] What are people going to think about us?
[1230.65] Stop worrying about people,
just tell me what's in your heart.
[1237.77] You want my answer? Then listen,
[1242.41] I don't like you, I want to marry Aima.
[1246.26] -You're lying.
-I'm telling the truth.
[1248.11] You're lying because
a girl like Aima doesn't deserve you.
[1252.39] -Why what is it that Aima doesn't have?
-Don't you know?
[1255.99] -Nosheen, she is my cousin.
-She is my cousin too.
[1259.36] She lives with me in my house.
I know her more than you do.
[1263.21] You know nothing about her.
[1266.14] Will you tell me clearly
what's the issue with Aima?
[1270.58] Aima isn't interested in you.
[1275.12] She is just compelled to marry you.
[1278.50] How can you put such
a huge allegation on her?
[1282.68] It's not an allegation,
I'm telling the truth.
[1284.97] Aima likes Zaid since childhood.
[1287.44] And as Zaid is getting married to Zoya so
she has no other option than to marry you.
[1292.09] A girl who isn't even
interested in you, Faiq,
[1295.25] how are you going top spend
all your life with her?
[1299.71] -If you don't believe, I can give you proof.
-No. I don't need any proof.
[1306.20] And look, I have no
issues with Aima's past.
[1309.72] And the reality is that me and her
are getting married. That's it.
[1315.48] Why do you want to marry a girl
who isn't even interested in you?
[1319.87] Because she is my mom's choice.
[1321.83] -Is that it?
-Yeah.
[1326.14] And the girl who loves you,
who can sacrifice everything for you
[1332.01] you are throwing her out of life,
and that too because of Aima?
[1336.49] -If I tell you about what she has done...
-Don't you dare!
[1338.83] Don't try to poison me against Aima.
[1342.42] Get lost from here right now.
[1345.38] You are doing so wrong
to me, Faiq, so wrong.
[1353.45] You are rejecting true love.
[1356.40] You are going to spoil both of our lives
by getting married to Aima.
[1367.29] Nosheen, please, try to understand.
Don't do this to me.
[1373.33] It's my wedding in a few weeks,
and I can end this relationship.
[1378.25] We can do whatever we want to.
You just need courage for that.
[1381.76] Well, just consider that I don't have
enough courage. Now go, please.
[1385.93] I'll go, just give me your answer.
[1389.97] I have already given you my answer.
[1392.32] No, just ask your heart and let me know.
[1395.65] Don't you like me?
[1397.89] -Nosheen, I...
-Yes or no>
[1402.59] Yes.
[1404.85] I accept that I like you.
But I can't get married to you.
[1411.12] -So are you compelled to marry Aima?
-You can say that.
[1416.50] Look, I have been under pressure
to marry Aima for several years.
[1424.86] Nosheen, crying like this won't help.
[1428.92] You've got a lot of time.
[1431.06] You can find anyone,
in fact much better than me.
[1437.23] Now go to your home, okay.
Go home and relax.
[1441.26] We'll talk later, all right?
I'm not going to tell anyone. Okay?
[1445.71] Relax.
[1468.30] Okay, Aima, I'm sorry.
[1470.58] Sorry!
[1476.27] At least you don't do  it.
[1480.14] I told you that I won't interfere
in your matter now.
[1482.72] Do whatever you like.
[1486.72] That's what I'm here to tell you.
[1488.87] I have given up, I'm going to talk to her.
[1492.21] -But just for your sake.
-What?
[1495.45] Zaid, go for your sake.
[1499.22] Go for Zoya's sake.
Go for the sake of your relationship.
[1503.55] And please stop fighting like kids and
try to sort out your issues on your own.
[1510.05] Why don't you tell this to her too?
[1511.76] I've told this to her as well,
and I'm telling this to you too.
[1516.68] Please, please stop fighting
and try to resolve your issues.
[1523.81] I don't know what is going to happen
to you both when I'll move to my in laws.
[1527.36] We'll wait for you to visit so that
we can place our case in your court.
[1533.30] You are totally crazy.
[1545.13] -Hello.
-Hello.
[1552.09] -Are you angry with me?
-No.
[1555.76] I'm so stupid. Obviously you must be angry.
[1560.36] I said such things to you. Sorry, Aima.
[1564.57] It's okay, no problem.
[1567.86] Besides, I have thought a lot
after what you've said.
[1572.07] I'm ready to talk to him, now.
[1574.65] And that's for your sake only, okay?
[1577.49] Otherwise, I was in no mood.
[1580.10] Okay, I'll let him know. I can't
talk right now as I'm a little busy.
[1589.62] Okay, bye.
[1595.54] It was Zoya. You both are similar.
[1601.84] If it weren't for you,
what would have happened to us?
[1603.70] Oh, please Zaid, stop it.
[1606.76] -Now go and talk to her.
-I will, right now I'm spending time with you.
[1611.03] Zaid I have a lot of things to do,
please go now.
[1613.19] Fold them properly.
[1614.34] -These aren't your clothes.
-That one, fold that properly.
[1619.08] Fold this.
[1620.53] -I'm doing it.
-Hurry up.
[1630.40] You have made your dresses for your
brother's wedding with so much difficulty.
[1634.11] Why haven't you made
any dresses for Aima's wedding?
[1638.47] Let's see if this wedding
takes place or not.
[1642.33] What nonsense are you talking about?
[1644.33] You know very well how
much her aunt overindulges her.
[1648.09] She is the only one who does that.
[1651.75] I just don't get it, you do weird things.
[1656.13] Mama, tell me, how much do you love me?
[1661.05] So now a mother has to prove her love?
[1665.14] I know that you love me, but how much?
[1670.07] You must have an idea 
about it yourself, Nosheen.
[1674.96] When you ran away, your
father had closed all doors on you.
[1679.72] And if you had returned
he would have shot you.
[1683.25] Think of all that. Even
after doing so much
[1686.51] you are sitting in this house
and that too availing all luxuries.
[1690.35] -Because of whom?
-Because of you only.
[1694.43] You don't have any doubts 
on my love now, do you?
[1697.29] No, no, I just want to test your love 
one more time.
[1702.76] Stop being so dramatic.
Tell me clearly what you want.
[1706.95] -Mama, get me married to Faiq.
-What did you just say?
[1712.56] Just get me and Faiq married.
[1715.80] I'm going to slap you tight.
[1719.79] You say whatever you like.
Don't you have any manners?
[1726.15] Don't you ever try to do 
such cheap prank with me again.
[1729.10] I'm serious. I'm not joking.
[1731.97] And what's wrong in it?
He is such a fit guy. And rich too.
[1735.90] The family is nice as well.
[1737.41] You will just have to convince his mom.
[1740.28] It's not about his mother, what
about Faiq? He is happily getting married.
[1746.37] Mama, that's the secret.
[1749.03] That poor guy is marrying
just because of his mom.
[1751.97] Otherwise he is in no mood to marry Aima.
[1756.45] Who is giving you 
such classified information?
[1760.95] Mama, just forget about 
who is telling me all this. But it's true.
[1765.41] You have turned into a mental patient.
[1767.54] Aima is getting married to a good
family and you just can't bear to watch it.
[1771.18] Mama, I'm telling you the truth.
[1773.83] You are a big liar. I won't believe you.
[1777.84] -Mama, I swear upon you.
-Why do you want me to die?
[1781.98] Mama, why don't you believe me?
[1784.58] Whatever you are saying 
is just a fragment of your imagination.
[1787.31] Aima and Faiq are having a grand wedding.
And that's the reality.
[1792.87] I had no idea that your
mental condition is like this
[1796.68] or else I would have consulted 
a psychiatrist for you.
[1799.89] Fine, don't believe me. 
But you still have a chance.
[1804.27] If you want you can talk to auntie Nimra.
[1808.96] Just shut up.
[1810.72] If you dad gets to know about it 
he is going to do that to you
[1813.77] that the world is going to see.
[1817.79] You are so scared of me.
[1831.50] You are getting married.
[1836.37] And you know well that after getting
married the responsibilities increase.
[1842.16] I'll be happy if you keep your focus on your
responsibilities more than your hobbies.
[1847.62] Faiq, why don't you talk to me? 
I've been missing you for so long.
[1851.98] Do you know that I was with Aima?
[1855.03] What if she got to know?
[1856.94] I don't care whatever she thinks.
[1859.78] -Did you see? Nosheen was here.
-Nosheen?
[1865.04] With whom?
[1866.94] No idea, she just left.
