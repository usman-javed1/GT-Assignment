[0.08] From flowers and from buds
[4.64] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.23] When I saw you
[14.17] I learned how to chirp from you
[18.75] -How was the doctor's visit?
-It was all right.
[22.51] The doctor has said that by
grace of God, everything is perfect.
[27.39] You both came at such a good time.
[30.82] Just see what your sister has
got for the baby from the market.
[35.02] Neither you are getting
it, nor anyone else.
[40.24] Everyone is just celebrating
the entry of a new member, that's it.
[46.09] Did you ever thing about
the kid who is yet to come?
[48.40] He is going to watch his parents
fight everyday. How is he going to feel?
[52.68] Are we going to give him this environment?
[54.04] Azmat Hussain is one tough nut.
[59.63] He may give a heart attack to
others but nothing will happen to him.
[66.75] And don't you worry at all.
[69.33] Because Zaid is going
to leave Aima for sure.
[72.22] He has got no other option.
[98.75] Prepare yourself to run around.
[104.75] Sister, brother Azmat,
[107.72] you both are going to become grandparents.
[119.34] Yes, my Zoya is expecting.
[160.07] I just pray to God to keep our
children filled with happiness like this.
[165.75] Your house will be filled with
happiness to with God's will.
[169.28] The happiness of my home
is my daughter, Nosheen.
[172.94] But of course it will increase
when the baby is here.
[177.81] Very nice. Anyway does she keep
resting all the time or helps you out too?
[184.18] No, my daughter in law supports
me and helps me out a lot.
[188.44] I have just asked her
these days to rest a bit.
[191.27] Besides, there is hardly
any work to do in my home.
[196.28] Brother, I just want to say to you,
[199.85] that I have forgiven my
children with all my heart,
[205.26] You clear your heart with
them and forgive them also.
[208.62] Exactly, I was telling him myself
that we should go meet the children.
[213.51] This way we can get
rid of all grudges too.
[216.21] But he takes time in
letting go off his grudges.
[221.41] I can understand. But I am really sorry.
[226.80] I couldn't come to see
you when you got ill.
[228.97] No, not at all. No need to be sorry.
[232.03] You remembered me, that's enough.
[234.98] But still, I came, and that
too on a happy occasion.
[238.10] I thought I will congratulate
too and see you as well.
[242.24] Congratulations to you too.
[245.94] May God give good fate to our kids.
[248.58] -Please carry on, I'll be right back.
-Sure.
[257.53] People have such dads who
forgive their children's mistakes.
[261.72] And here my dad, he isn't even
happy for me on such a big news.
[266.34] He will only be happy when I'll die.
[269.35] Nosheen, what nonsense?
Show some respect towards your dad.
[274.84] Has he ever shown me that he is my dad?
[276.94] Parentâ€™s stature isn't so
great for no reason, mama.
[280.40] They have to forgive their children's
mistake, they have to own them.
[292.18] And my dad,
[295.24] even God forgives us on our mistakes
then what does he think of himself?
[299.48] What are you talking about? What
would your mother in law think?
[303.55] No, Nosheen might be
saying it in the wrong way,
[309.12] but she is saying the right thing.
[314.54] Please tell him to forgive her.
[318.50] See, how good my mother in law is?
[325.97] Neither she makes faces like dad,
nor she keeps scolding me all the time.
[332.94] Even if I commit a mistake, she
explains me in such a good way.
[342.16] What do I do? Whenever I want to do something
good it turns out completely opposite.
[351.43] Everyone has complaints from
me, nobody is happy with me.
[354.90] Everybody hates me.
[357.82] What are you saying? She is just a kid
and kids say anything when they are angry.
[362.77] It doesn't mean at
all that she hates you.
[366.01] Then what shall I do?
[368.74] How will everything get better?
How will everyone be happy?
[373.68] Just have patience, everything is
going to be fine with time. Don't worry.
[379.46] I hope that happens. I am just fed up.
[383.95] Everything is going to
be fine, have faith on God.
[388.51] Don't loose hope from Him.
[390.62] At times He listens right
away and at times he takes time.
[395.34] But whatever He does is better for us.
[398.65] You're right.
[400.38] Look, just try one and bring him our home.
[404.31] This way Nosheen will get happy too.
[526.78] Oh, you're here and I
was looking for you inside.
[529.99] Auntie, who is going to drink this milk?
[534.45] You, who else. Hold it.
[537.45] But I don't even like milk.
[540.21] Whether you like it or
not, you have to drink it.
[544.54] Oh, so now you are going to do all those
things that mother in laws do in dramas?
[550.11] Of course I will. I am
going to do all those things.
[553.27] But usually mother in laws in dramas
and movies are very dangerous.
[556.94] But you aren't like them.
[559.22] Really? How am I then?
[562.54] My opinion about you is changing.
[565.80] Really? I should know to what
my daughter thinks about me?
[574.11] No, I won't tell you now.
[576.67] That's not fair.
[580.20] Anyway, Asim has sent some money for you.
[583.32] Money for me? Why?
[585.98] Well, after all you are his sister in law.
[589.03] Yeah, but why did he send money?
[592.75] He has said that my
sister in law should do
[595.05] a lot of shopping for
herself and the baby.
[599.86] He is so excited.
[603.55] Oh, okay.
[606.72] Yeah, he was saying, no matter
what I will reach here for sure.
[612.06] Of course, the uncle
shall be present here.
[615.86] Of course. He is really happy.
[619.61] Everyone's so happy in your house. 
And look at my family,
[626.18] nobody is happy at all. 
Didn't you see dad?
[632.60] There was no happiness on his face at all.
[636.48] Oh, come on, it's nothing like
that they are very happy too.
[641.84] No, auntie, you don't know
how dad is.
[644.62] When he is happy he doesn't stay
quiet, he expresses his happiness so much.
[649.59] But today...
[652.69] Anyway, don't get sad. Let the baby 
come, first, then you'll see.
[660.15] -Don't know when he is going to be normal.
-Very soon.
[664.18] What can happen after the baby comes?
[666.52] Let him come once, then you'll see
how he becomes everyone's favorite.
[671.70] No, even then Zaid's son will
be more dear to him, you'll see.
[677.22] It's not like that, maternal grandparents
hold their daughter's children very dear.
[683.09] -Auntie, may I ask you something?
-Sure.
[686.63] You said when he will come,
does that mean that you want a boy?
[691.77] Not at all, I said it just like that.
[695.76] In fact, it's my true wish
[699.47] that may God gives you
a beautiful daughter.
[705.85] Just like the moon, like you.
[709.24] And what if I have a son?
[712.02] Even then he shall be like you.
[717.12] Not stubborn like Faiq.
[721.18] Auntie, you like me more than your son.
[725.01] Yeah, that's true.
[726.85] Nosheen, you are actually very dear to me.
[729.59] Auntie, I feel like you say all these
things to make me feel good only.
[734.72] No, Nosheen, you are
honestly very dear to me.
[740.55] Just like Faiq and Asim.
[742.77] Yo have fulfilled my
wish of having a daughter.
[745.64] -Shall I tell you something?
-What?
[750.26] Faiq said  sorry to me.
[752.95] Oh, wow! This means that
idiot is back to his senses.
[762.56] Nosheen, just have a little more patience.
[769.00] Once the baby is born, you'll see,
Faiq will be straight like an arrow
[774.42] and will hover around you only.
[845.61] I hate this girl, I don't like her at all.
[849.12] Please stop it,
Faiq. She is your wife.
[851.41] So what? If I don't
like her then I don't.
[854.59] What can I do about it?
[857.50] Sania,
[859.68] -I'm falling in love with...
-Just stop it, Faiq!
[861.90] Don't you dare say anything stupid.
[863.88] Don't say anything because of which
I don't see you ever again.
[1032.98] What is it? Why are you
messaging me when I'm at home?
[1037.16] But you weren't with me.
[1040.34] Yeah, I was sitting in the lounge.
[1045.15] Were you busy with anything important?
[1049.66] No.
[1051.38] I hope I didn't disturb you.
[1054.50] Now, what does that mean?
[1055.99] No, I was asking just like that
[1059.12] whether I have disturbed you.
[1062.33] You have a habit to check my
phone, go ahead, you can check it.
[1066.02] No, I was asking just like that.
[1071.99] Honestly. Do you want me to
swear upon our unborn child?
[1076.40] What is wrong with you? Why do you
keep swearing upon on such petty things?
[1080.68] And why do I always
have to give explanations?
[1086.17] Can't we have a normal
conversation? I was actually missing you.
[1090.42] Anyway, forget it. Tell me, did you go
to your mom's house? How did it go?
[1095.88] It was fine.
[1098.85] Who was present there?
[1100.96] Mama, dad, and we met
auntie too when we were leaving.
[1104.65] Anybody else?
[1109.21] I mean, did you meet Zaid?
[1112.42] No, he wasn't home.
And I didn't even ask about Aima and Zoya.
[1119.03] Okay.
[1121.37] Faiq, I was thinking of
going for some shopping.
[1132.09] Why? Do you need any clothes?
[1134.83] No, I don't.
[1137.10] Actually, I don't have much
idea about ladies' shopping
[1141.56] so, you can go with mom.
[1144.06] No, Faiq. You know, 
Asim has sent me money.
[1148.27] Yeah, mom was telling me.
[1151.10] That's why, I thought we shall
go shopping with that money.
[1158.38] I will get something for me and
for something for the baby too.
[1163.61] Nosheen, I think I shall get whatever
you want for yourself right now.
[1167.26] Isn't it too soon to
buy stuff for the baby?
[1169.94] Yeah, you are right.
[1172.43] Okay, now you go rest.
In fact you should sleep.
[1176.22] Salman will be here in a while. 
I have to meet him.
[1179.26] Is it something important?
[1181.65] Actually, Salman was
visiting nearby,
[1184.51] so, I asked him to come over
and we can meet here.
[1191.11] Is there any problem?
[1194.28] No.
[1232.48] Everything is finalized. Once the interior
is done we'll fix a date for the shoot.
[1238.41] Okay.
[1241.94] By the way, Sania has done a great job.
[1245.85] Are you listening to what I said?
[1248.78] Yeah, I'm listening. 
You were praising Sania.
[1252.35] Yeah, she came to the restaurant today.
[1255.37] -Really, did she?
-Yeah.
[1257.45] She came for around ten minutes,
overviewed the work and then left.
[1264.48] What time did she come?
[1265.88] She came around half
an hour after your left.
[1269.66] -Did she say anything about me?
-Yeah we had a little chat.
[1273.78] Was she saying anything about me?
[1275.84] No, she was only talking about work.
She stood for a while and then left.
[1281.23] Okay.
[1283.35] What happened? Aren't you talking to her?
[1289.25] Don't know, she isn't answering
my calls nor replying to my messages.
[1294.38] Why are you calling her?
[1296.27] Actually, I was
calling her for work.
[1298.76] Her check is ready. But
she isn't taking my calls.
[1304.95] I don't even know her
account number.
[1306.42] Or if I can call her and ask
how to transfer her amount.
[1310.53] Man, why are you getting so
hyper? I was asking you just like that.
[1315.77] Salman, I think you are being sarcastic.
[1319.40] I think you have become
really possessive regarding Sania.
[1322.66] You start fighting without any reason.
[1324.73] Actually, don't know what
is wrong with me these days,
[1327.50] I am reacting with everyone like this.
[1329.75] I can imagine. You have
too much work load too,
[1333.54] and then Sania isn't
talking to you either.
[1336.46] Yeah, she isn't even talking to me. 
Don't know why.
[1339.56] -Shall I talk to Sania if you want?
-What for?
[1343.23] -About the check.
-No, I'll talk to her myself.
[1347.45] Okay, fine.
[1348.61] Just get her check ready.
[1352.04] Text me the amount,
 I'll get her check ready.
[1355.09] Okay, I'll text you.
[1357.52] -Okay, I'll leave now, it's too late.
-No, sit, I'll get some tea made for you.
[1362.74] No, it's already too late. 
Your wife must be waiting for you.
[1367.83] She must be asleep by now, 
don't worry about her.
[1370.92] She must be thinking
that I take all of your time.
[1373.62] No, Salman, it's not like that.
[1375.42] Please sit, I have to talk to you
about something else too.
[1378.27] Regarding to?
[1379.63] Actually, Salma, I want that you shall be
aware about the details of my business.
[1385.30] What for?
[1386.62] No, not for any specific reason.
[1388.90] Actually, Asim isn't here too.
[1390.77] So, I want a trust worthy
friend to know all the details.
[1396.24] Okay.
[1397.17] You know, few days ago a friend 
of mine had a heart attack.
[1404.98] His family had no clue
about his account details,
[1408.52] whether he has any money in them or not.
[1410.59] So, that's why I want it.
[1412.35] You are right, even my family isn't here.
[1416.41] Salman, I say, you should get married now.
[1419.88] I am thinking about it. Once I get
settled then I'll get married right away.
[1424.19] With God's will.
[1425.84] What do you think about it then?
[1447.01] How is your health now?
How are you feeling?
[1451.68] Don't know.
[1454.33] I don't get it. It feels as if something
very bad is about to happen.
[1461.56] Nothing as such is going
to happen, with God's will.
[1464.48] Your wife and her mother 
have hurt me so much.
[1471.59] There is a limit to take revenge.
[1477.66] How can they even think about it?
[1483.55] Did you talk to Zoya?
[1485.74] No, I haven't talked to her.
[1488.41] What have you thought about her demands?
[1491.94] There is nothing
to think about it.
[1493.67] First, of all please relax.
[1496.34] Whatever they have asked,
nothing as such is going to happen.
[1499.02] What if they don't give up?
[1504.28] I assure you, Dad. Just don't worry.
[1510.41] Neither I will leave Aima, nor I
will let Zoya do any such thing.
[1515.09] Zoya shouldn't have said it.
[1521.34] If a person loses his respect in someone
eyes, then no matter how much he tries
[1527.45] he can never regain his place.
[1530.53] I know, Dad. But I'm sure auntie
must have suggested her to say so.
[1534.97] Yeah, but she only listens to her mother.
[1537.76] She doesn't want to have
any connection with us.
[1542.99] She will do it in future too, whatever
her mother is going to guide her to do.
[1549.09] The girls who follow their mother's
suggestions after getting married,
[1555.74] they can never think or
understand about right or wrong.
[1559.45] They can never take their own decisions.
[1565.06] And I think Zoya's case is similar.
[1568.88] Youâ€™re right, but don't
worry I'll talk to Zoya.
[1573.30] And I'm sure, she'll
understand if I talk to her.
[1576.09] -Are you sure?
-Yes, Dad, I'm sure.
[1579.48] Please just don't take stress.
[1584.22] That's what I'm hoping.
[1586.34] Yeah. So, just hope for
the best and pray to God.
[1592.70] -Are you free tomorrow?
-Yes, do you want me to do anything?
[1597.03] Yeah, I wanted to take some
sweet to Nosheen's house.
[1603.70] There is a good news. I feel that
we both should go to her home.
[1610.38] Sure, Dad, as you wish.
[1612.89] -And, I'm happy about one thing.
-What's that?
[1618.18] Nosheen is on good terms
now with her mother in law.
[1623.20] Well, that's great.
[1629.06] Okay, you take rest,
I'll talk to you later.
[1632.84] Okay, sure.
[1658.19] Why isn't Zoya picking up?
[1674.81] -Hello, Zoya, how are you doing?
-Zoya is asleep already.
[1678.43] But why are you calling at this hour?
[1680.78] Greetings. Actually, I called to
see how Zoya is doing. How is she?
[1687.65] Everything is okay on our side.
You tell me.
[1691.20] I'm fine.
[1692.97] Strange, you are still  doing fine?
[1698.80] I didn't get you, auntie.
[1701.59] Oh, I think they didn't tell you anything.
[1705.88] what didn't they tell me?
[1707.30] Well, let me tell you then.
[1709.58] Zoya has told them
[1711.71] that she will continue her pregnancy
only when Zaid gives you a divorce.
[1746.68] Faisal, what do you think? Am I
going to still get blackmailed by you?
[1750.77] Look, I didn't say anything like that.
[1753.64] Do one thing, tell anyone
anything you want to.
[1760.52] I am not going to be
intimidated by your threats, got it?
[1763.31] I never think wrong about you,
[1766.65] but it's true that I like
to spend time with you.
[1771.29] Is this something that
is acceptable for a wife?
[1777.34] Answer me.
[1778.79] How can you block me from here?
[1781.87] -Faisal, go away from here, I say go away.
-Nosheen, who is it?
[1785.84] Greetings, auntie. I'm Faisal.
[1788.38] She is only going to stay with
you when you will divorce Aima.
[1793.44] -What if I don't do that?
-Up to you.
[1796.47] You can forget about Zoya 
and your kid then.
[1800.40] -Are you threatening me?
-You can think of it whatever you like.
[1804.76] But Zoya is not going to
change her decision now.
