Why did you have any work? No, son, there was no work, but if you're going out, then what's the problem with these clothes? There's nothing wrong with these clothes, but Bhaijaan might object. He does n't like girls wearing such clothes. Your Bhaijaan is my dad and I have my uncle to take care of my dad. Now, why don't you take care of your daughter, Aamaa, she's after me all the time. You've ruined my whole mood, nothing can ruin your mood [Music] How many times have you  I haven't visited for days You are so busy, I know, but what can I do I don't get time You know that after Riyaz's death I have to look after the entire business It is very difficult and I understand time management, yes, I know you have become a big businesswoman, but this doesn't mean that a person should leave his relationships, ok baba, sorry I will come, I will come soon, tell me how is everyone at home, how is Azmat bhai, Azmat is also busy like you and the children have their own life, no one has time for me, why, there is your sister-in-law, I talk to her, it is enough to make my blood boil, baaji, let me give you some advice, keep Zaid away from this girl, I do n't like her intentions, I can guess, I always say that mothers and daughters are not what they appear to be, despite knowing everything I am helpless, you know Azmat does n't value my words and as for Zaid, he also only does his own thing, you don't make Jaya understand and don't give this girl too much free time  Okay, I will try to explain but when does she understand? Now let's see how many good proposals have come but she is a girl and does n't listen to them. Are you thinking of her marriage? If there is a good option, I will think about it. Right now she is studying, why should I worry about her so soon? I am not worried but I am a single mother so I can't delay it much. But this will be done when my daughter likes someone. That girl does n't like anyone. The matter will reach the stage of marriage only when she selects someone. Okay, I will talk to you later, rather I will just take a round. I have some work, let me take care of that. Allah Hafiz Allah Hafiz [Music] Why did I get so angry? No one knows. By the way, Zoya or Faraz were talking to you a lot. Mast Magan.

He had gone to meet Rashid sahab. What's the matter? The kids haven't come yet. Yes, I called Zaid. They were at Amber's house. They must be coming. Where is Nausheen? She has gone to sleep. No, she has actually gone with her friends. Yes, she has gone for dinner. She must be coming. What time is it to go for dinner? I do n't like her going out like this. Why are you getting upset over small things? I am telling you that she will come. You have given her a lot of freedom. I am not a fan of so much freedom. Did you understand that Asif's Fansi is so beautiful? No, seriously. What did you like about her? What's the point in looks? A person should have a good heart. Yes, all these things are said and sound good but the fact is that nowadays looks matter. No matter how good a person's heart is, it doesn't matter. No, Saya. Now see how good understanding Asif has with his Fansi. And I also like the couple of both of them. Yes, yes, I agree. The most important thing for me is a person.  There is intellectual compatibility what is the use of beauty it is not there today I don't understand the talks between you two I will never marry an older boy no matter how good hearted he is okay brother you can marry a hero anyway you do so much modeling to trap Zaid it is such a bad thing for kind formation I don't trap people people trap me ok brother now your fight between you two is over so Zaid let's go where are you guys going you guys sit down tell them that you are at my house please wait look Zoya till I do n't go home baba will not be able to sleep your baba is Zaid's rail baba ok then he will go and convince you sit down please please p you are saying the right thing friend if baba gets angry then he does n't listen to anyone and she is his darling she will be saved I will be in trouble ah listen get that uncle to pack we are waiting in the car come on let's go yes see you see you see you ok listen what is the plan for tomorrow yes  done done done, come on ma, come quickly done [Music] Keep on talking on the phone, what time have you come at night, uncle, you should not talk like this, because of you kids, your dad scolds me a lot, yesterday also he was scolding me so much, all the issues are with me only, he does not say anything to Aima and Zaid, whenever I see you, Aima and Zaid keep roaming around, now Zaid bhai is a cousin, not a real brother, I have also told him the same thing, but he does not find a single bad thing in Aima, I am the real daughter of uncle and whenever I see him, he keeps singing the praises of Aima and you please explain to papa also, what should I explain, that he should not interfere in my matters, why, when I was going yesterday, I was saying, don't wear such clothes, he has nothing to do with your clothes, uncle, I also said the same thing, my uncle is there for me, you should take care of your daughter Aima, did you understand, nothing, you get ready for breakfast quickly, then daddy will ask about you, okay go, go [Music] okay ka function mom it was so good I  Had so much fun last night Was it late to come or not but by the time I came you were already asleep and IM and JD also came to meet you I was not feeling well last night I slept early Mom what happened now are you feeling well right Perfect good can I ask you one thing Mom why do you and Zaid take Ama with you everywhere [Music] what kind of question is this it's a simple question why don't you both go alone why do you take her with you everywhere Mom if she is with me then what is wrong in it she is my friend son you are a very simple girl I do n't know why I feel that you will suffer a great loss because of her Mom she is very simple you are completely misunderstanding her you know how much she helps people I told you that you are very simple because you don't know these tricks now see how she controlled both the men there while staying in Baji's house Mom please don't talk to me like this are you okay don't believe me one day you will see this girl  She will teach everyone a very good lesson, I buttered her up, why did I not like this, nobody [Sangeet] I don't know if you had any conversation with Nausheen yesterday [Sangeet] No, there was no special conversation, yes, I told her that brother does n't like these clothes, so it is possible that she might have felt bad about what I said and that is why you immediately filled your brother's ears with it. No, no Bhabhi, I haven't spoken to brother about this, I have only spoken to Nasheen, I know what you talk about with your brother, when. No, no Bhabhi, believe me, I have n't spoken to brother about this, I only told Nasheen that brother does n't like these kinds of clothes on girls, so now you will tell him what his dad likes, nowadays all girls wear such clothes and most of all I know what your daughter is wearing and where she is going. Bhabhi, you are right, but I had no motive behind this. Nasheen is my own child, daughter, that's why I was explaining to her, Aima, she is your daughter, you keep an eye on her, no one becomes decent by wearing decent clothes. Shabana what do you mean bhabhi brother people don't look at girls who come home late at night with a good eye otherwise you are quite intelligent [Music] Bhabhi I made a mistake I wo n't say anything to Nashin in future yes brother this is better for you because I am still alive for her alright [Music] I am not scared of seeing dreams but of their getting shattered I talk to you and meet you every day but still I don't know who is in your heart sometimes I feel that it is me but then I think whether I am being misunderstood and I compose myself but it is also true that I dream of you and only you since childhood I have loved only you Zaid but I have never expressed this to anyone else except myself and neither will I ever do so if Allah has written you in my fate then I will consider myself lucky but if it doesn't happen then [Music] Mother [Music] what was mother doing I don't know anything just like that I talk about the whole day at night until you do n't share your thoughts with her you don't feel at peace [Music]  I get it when you know then why are you asking, Amma, are you taking the medicines on time, right? Yes, son I am taking them because this time your reports have not come out well, your sugar is very high, you know I don't know when I will get rid of the medicines, it will never be free because the doctors say that you may forget to eat but you cannot forget to take medicines, well leaving my health aside, he said one thing, Amma, what's the matter, the issue is that the girls who do n't have the protection of their father have to take every step very cautiously, Amma, you have told me this a thousand times before, son, by repeating it again and again, things are remembered, I want you not to take any such step which raises questions on my upbringing, has Mehmani said anything to you? No, no one has said anything to me, so I was just telling you, son, don't go to the party in the evening with Zoya and Jahad, Amma Jaan, I went after asking you, I went with your permission, and wherever I go, I go after asking you, yes  Son, when you asked, I did not refuse because I would spoil your mood, but son, be careful from now on. Yes, mother [Music] [Music] [Music] what are you doing, are you playing a game? No, no, dad, I was just free for a little while, so you know just how free you are, then you should come to the factory. No, dad, you are not even that free now. There are just two days' examination leave, so I was just passing some time. So, what did you think after the paper? Right now, I have not thought of anything. If you have not thought of anything, then think about it. I want you to join my factory. Anyway, I have become very lonely, dad. Please, keep me away from these things for a few days. You know what we have done to you, still you are saying this. I hope you will disrespect me. Don't worry dad, I won't deprive you. I will join the factory soon. Son, such a non-serious attitude in life ruins a person. Be a little serious. [Music] Hello, I am Zoya, I am talking. Yes, yes, I am coming.  I will go, how far do I have to go? Okay, thank you so much, what happens, mom. Guess your result must have come out. I had given my portfolio to various places, so I got a call from there. They selected me and I have my audition tomorrow. So son, I don't like your hobby of modelling at all. Mom, we have already discussed this before and you know it is my passion and you will see that I will earn so much fame, so much fame and along with that, what is the need to earn money? Your dad who left behind so much, it's all yours, mom. That money is not mine, it belongs to dad and I am talking about my money. First of all, I don't understand what you are saying. No problem, mom, you don't even need to understand. Okay, you ask Bheenu baba to make coffee, please [music] Love you, yes, I will definitely tell you, okay, Allah Hafiz, what's the matter? Shawana looks very happy. Whose call was it brother? It's good that you came to me here. It's a happy thing. It was a call from Ima Keep. Actually, he was calling his elder son.  She is asking for Aama's hand for Fai. Actually she likes Aama a lot and now wants to make her her daughter-in-law. Our Aima is so nice that everyone would want to make her the daughter-in-law of their house. Alhamdulillah ji Bhaijaan. That is why I told her that I should first consult with brother and then I will tell him. That is fine. But Shivana, for now, refuse him by giving some suitable excuse. [Music] No one knows why you became unwanted. We don't have any brother on whose assistance we can sit at home. Aha Shawana is lucky in this matter. Your Faf was talking about your relationship with Fai, so what did you say? What did I have to say? I was happy, hang up the phone, ok, bye. [Music]
