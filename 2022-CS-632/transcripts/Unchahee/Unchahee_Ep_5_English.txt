From flowers and from buds I have learnt to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learnt how to chirp from you  Brother, what if
 Aima has committed suicide? Just shut up, Nosheen. Can't you
say something nice for once. Just don't worry, sister.
 I'll go and ask her. Why would I worry? And if she does something silly,
then I'm telling you we shouldn't be blamed. -How is your friend doing?
-She is fine. If she she fine
what was all the drama about? What do you mean drama?
She actually passed out, Mom. You don't know how cunning such girls are. Mom, you stay here but you have the news
about everyone and that too false news. Okay so you are calling your aunt
a liar because of that girl? You know well that it's nothing like that,
aunt just exaggerates. Okay, fine. You get too
possessive about that girl. Mom, she has got a name, Aima. And I just have to best friends. Who should I get possessive
about if not them? Okay! No need to get so serious. You know, whenever you say something
bad about Aima, I feel bad. But you always talk about her like that. Mom, just don't do it. -Talk about something else.
-Okay, fine. Tell me, is there something going on
 between Aima and Zaid? -What do you mean? What's going on?
-I mean an affair? They are really good friends, Mom. Like me and Zaid.
What are you talking about. Oh come on, they wouldn't tell you. -They must be hiding it from you.
-Why would they hide  from me, Mom? I know each and everything about
them, and they know all my secrets. You know what, Mom? You
just pose that you are progressive, but like others
you are conservative too. Okay, fine, it just came
to my mind so I asked you. Mom, please don't talk too much with aunt. And if you want to talk to her
then please don't discuss Aima. Okay, let's talk about something else. You have got some proposals. -Not now, Mom.
-Huh? Hey... Zoya! I don't know why this girl
minds so much if I say something. What's wrong, Nosheen? Why are you
sitting like this? Everything all right?  I can sit the way I want. It's my house and my room. Why do you care? You got angry for no reason. We haven't talked for so many days,
so I thought of checking up on you. You are saying as if
 we used to talk everyday. Look, Nosheen, we are cousins. We live in the same house.
Why can't we be good friends then? Why? Do you want something from me? Not at all, why would I
 want anything from you. And you know it well that if I need
anything I ask it from mother or dad. Then why have you come here
 to become friends? Why? Can't we be friends? Aima, just stop bugging me, go from
here there is already an issue. What is it? Tell me. Since when have you become
so interested in my life? Look... Look, may be I can be
of any help to you, huh? You want to help me? Okay then, listen. The college is taking everyone to the
farm house, but I didn't get permission. So tell me, can you help me? Will you? Duh, going to help me. Look if you didn't get permission, then
there must be something good in it for you. Whatever our parents think for us... Madam, just don't give me a lecture, go
away, I don't want to be friends with you. Why not? Because you are really boring
and not my type either. What do you mean? I didn't get you. You attend every night party with brother
Zaid yourself, and then you preach me. -Nosheen, I...
-Aima, Ger lost. Just go. Did you ask the doctor what
was the reason she fainted? Sister, she didn't have her meals that day. That's why she fainted. Are you sure this was the only reason? Yes, what else could it be. I mean it can be that she
took some pills or anything. -Pills? What sort of pills?
-Oh come on. Don't people take sleeping
pills to commit suicide? God forbid, sister. Why would my Aima do that? One should asses the problem
 from every angle. And as far as why she did it, then you aren't a kid either.
You know well  to what extent people go
in the matter of love. Sister... Fear God. Aima discusses everything with me. Why would she do it? Look, you have a mother's point of you,
that's why you are getting angry at me. These are very bad times,
specially for girls. They are killing themselves,
running away from their homes, and God knows what not are they
doing without telling their parents. I keep listening to stories like these. If that's the case then it's my advice that
you should get her married right away. Thank you for your advice, sister. But it's nothing like that. Okay, I'll leave then. You may feel bad about what I just said, 
but I just said it for your betterment. Okay? Keep an eye on Aima. So, all good now? -Hmm? Yes.
-Thank God, you are okay with me now. Or else at one point 
I thought you will never talk to me. Me too. Aima, promise me you are never going
to be angry like this with me. First promise me that you
are never going to hurt me. Here I promise with my heart. I got really shocked, 
the way you behaved with me. I felt that you consider me as worthless. I know, I'm... I'm really sorry. I always thought that the way you
consider all my things as yours I had a right on everything of yours. Aima, not had, you have the right.
And you are always going to have it. Okay then, fine, I also promise that
I am never going to get angry with you. I'm such an idiot. I got flared up on such a petty issue, 
don't know what was I thinking. Well thank God that Mr. Zaid
 has an idea about it. Okay, now forget about this incident. Why should I forget it, I have come to tell
you who I was chatting with the other day. -With whom?
-The girl from section C, Kinza. Kinza Khan? She talked to you? Well, you can say 
we both have become quite close. Really? Close? How can I be more specific than this? Are... are you flirting with her? Oh, no, much more than flirt, our eyes and hearts have met. I have started an affair with her. Did you get it, miss Tube light? What? Aren't you shocked? -Zoya must have told you already, she...
-Huh? No... She hasn't told me anything. But there is a problem. -Aren't you going to ask me the reason?
-Yeah, what happened? Kinza is angry with me, because of you. Because of me? Well you were angry, so
while trying to appease you  I wasn't able to reply to her messages
or attend her calls. She got angry for no reason. But now, you are going to help me. -And I need your help in appeasing her.
-I... How can I help you? You are going to tell me what should 
I gift her, so that she gets happy with me. Because I really trust your choice. Zaid... are you serious about her? Very much. I think I am in love with her. Zaid and Kinza's pair, excellent.
 It's going to be fun. And you aren't that dumb, that you are going to tell anyone 
and mess with me. I am going to go in a while. Be ready. Why did I become unwanted {\an8}Nobody knows that Why did I become unwanted {\an8}Nobody knows that Even if I had said anything
else than farm house, dad wouldn't have allowed
me to stay over night. Cancel tonight's party.
We'll go on a dinner date someday. I know, Faisal, 
but please try to understand. I can't get out of the house. I know... I'd tell you if there is just one issue. There are so many issues. It's not about the keys. How am I going to get back? Faisal... Faisal, just listen to me. What's up Nosheen, everything okay? I'm sorry, I was a bit mad that day 
that's why I said all that to you. It's okay, doesn't matter. -So, do you want to be friends with me?
-Yes. But friendship is a very
sensitive relationship. -One has to trust the other.
-Yes that's really important. And if a friend asks for a favor, 
one has to give it as well. -Yes.
-So, we are have become friends now? -May be.
-Then prove your friendship and give me a favor. -What sort of favor?
-I am going to leave for the farm house in  while. -Are you mad?
-Shh. You won't have to do much. Just open the grill for me
 when I leave and get back. And I'll be back by 4:00 am. Nosheen, you have gone mad.
 I am not going to do anything like that. Look, you won't have any problem. Dad's sleeping, mom would be 
over the phone, and Zaid in his room. I  have locked the door of my room. So that everyone thinks that I'm inside.
What do you think of my plan? Nosheen, I am not doing it at all. You don't have the option to say no to me. And you aren't that silly that you
tell anyone about it and mess with me. I am leaving in a while. Be ready. Nosheen, listen to me. This girl has gone mad. This girl is going 
to get doomed herself and me as well. It's so late. Oh, God, what test have you put me through. I was just trying to do what dad asked. Aima, you are still up, everything okay? Yes, actually I couldn't sleep,
 so I thought I should walk a bit. If you were getting bored you should have
messaged me, I was getting bored too. You are still up? Oh, yes, those in love
aren't able to sleep. By the way, what are you so sad about? -What do you mean?
-Just look at your face. It's 2:30 at night 
and your face still shows 12:00. -I mean, is everything okay?
-Yeah, I just... couldn't sleep. You... just stop bothering me,
 I am going to sleep now. Okay listen, why don't we order pizza
 in midnight deal? Let's have it together. Zaid, I have a headache, 
I'm going to sleep. Okay, listen... You know that if you have any sort of
problem, you can always share with me. Yeah, I have got no problem. I am going. Okay, good night. Kinza... what the hell. Call me. -Okay, I'll go now.
-Just stay for a little while. Faisal don't be insane. Dad get's up for midnight prayers at times.
Just go from here now. Just stay for a little longer. Oh God, please save me. 
Don't know what's going to happen. -You are up so early today, Nosheen?
-Yes I got up early. Where is dad? I have come to ask you that. Don't know where he has gone this early in
the morning. He has never done that before. -So haven't you met him since morning?
-No. When did you get up? Did you see him go? I am worried, where has he gone this
early without even having breakfast. Why don't you cal him? I did call, but he disconnected. 
What if there is a mishap at the factory. You seem scared, you... have you done anything stupid again? I am asking you. What have you done now? First promise me, mother
that you are not going to scold me. Tell me right away, or else I have
other ways to make you spill it out. Nosheen! I am asking you something. Actually, mother... -I went to the party last night, and... 
-And? And dad saw me when I was getting back. Mother... How are you feeling now? Thank God, I'm much better. I really got worried last night, you know. You are getting worried for no reason. And you woke up brother 
for no reason either. You know, how worried
he gets because of me. It wasn't a small thing, mother. Your BP got really high. -Tell me, if anything happened to you then?
-Nothing is going to happen to me. Mother... What are you thinking? Nothing. I'm thinking that brother
 shouldn't have taken me to the hospital. And hadn't seen Nosheen like that. Mother, why are you feeling guilty? It's Nosheen's fault. 
She shouldn't have done this. You are right, she has crossed all limits. Getting back with a guy alone 
at that hour of night. Her attire. Brother couldn't even look me in the eye. Thank God that the guy left, had he stayed, don't know 
what brother would have done to him. Mother, did dad say anything to Nosheen? What could he say? He just went quite. He went in his room and locked himself up. Nosheen entered the house later. It's such a painful thing for a father. I think I shouldn't do breakfast 
with brother today. But mother he has been gone since morning. After humiliating me in front 
of my father you ask what's wrong? Look,whatever has happened 
with you I am sorry about it. Why did I become unwanted {\an8}Nobody knows that Why did I become unwanted {\an8}Nobody knows that What? Where has he gone this early? I don't know, 
maybe he has told aunt about it. May God have mercy. Don't know what my brother
 must be going through right now. Mother, what is dad going 
to do with Nosheen? I have no idea. But whatever he is going to do,
 he will do it for Nosheen's betterment. May God guide Nosheen to the right path. If someone else does 
such a thing, one can ignore it. But Nosheen is my niece. My own blood. Now don't take so much stress, mother,
or else your BP is going to shoot again. Come on, lie down and rest for a while.
 I'll go and get you some juice. You just get worried for no reason. Durrani, can't see anybody at home
where is everyone gone? Sir has gone out, 
the rest of them are home. -All right.
-Okay. Did you have your breakfast? No not yet. Everyone is at home and still no one
was at the dining table for breakfast. May be they don't feel like it right now. -As you don't feel like having it.
-I'm going to have it in a while. -Has something happened?
-No, what happened? It's for the first time that everyone is
home and no one came for breakfast... Are... are you hiding something from me? No Zaid, why would 
I hide anything from you? I know you since childhood, 
I can read your face. And you are going to hide it from me? Zaid, what is your problem. That's the problem, that you aren't
telling me what the problem is. -Yes, there is a problem.
-What? I can' tell you right now,
 just go to the university. What do you mean I should go, 
aren't you coming? No, mother is not feeling well today
 so I am going to stay with her. Is she really sick? If you say I can stay
home too because dad isn't home either. No, she is fine, I'll take care of her. Just go to university,
you are getting late. -Okay, fine, but call me if you need me.
-Yeah, okay. He disconnected again. This silence is indicating
 that a storm is on it's way. Nosheen, I don't know what curse
are we going to face this time. Oh... Neither you had done all this,
 nor we had to face this issue. Mother, I said, I'm sorry. And how would I have known that dad would
take aunt to the hospital yesterday night, and he will get back at the time
 I was supposed to get back. It's just my bad luck. A person decides for his
luck himself, Nosheen,  what were you
thinking when you left? You went so blind after him that you didn't realize how you
are going to get back home? Who is going to open the door for you? You should have told me, 
you should have called me after you left. I am not that silly, Mother. I had given Aima the task 
of opening the door for me. Oh, God, what should I do
with you, you crazy girl! You dug your own grave. Why, Mother? She came
 to me yesterday to become friends. So I thought of taking advantage. I feel like slapping you hard 
for what you have done. Why don't you just hit me then, you
have been scolding me for so long. What should I do then? 
Praise you on what you did? What did I do? You can't differentiate
between you foe and friend, Nosheen. You have made your enemy a witness. You know, they both 
can never do good to us. -Mother, I just thought that...
-Just shut up! Now I understand what the matter is. As soon as you left, Aima told her mother. And she pretended to be
sick and found an excuse so that Azmat can catch
you red handed, Nosheen. Now I get it, Mother. What is the use of getting it now, Nosheen? They both have gotten you black listed
in front of your dad for all your life. I won't spare this Aima. You never miss any? Not even Asim's? Nice. Let me know next time,
I'll arrange for passes. Done. -Did you enjoy? Was it crowded?
-Yes. -Had more fun on Fawad's concert.
-Oh, wait a second. -Zoya, hi.
-Hi. I'm getting very bored today 
because Aima hasn't come. Yeah right, Aima hasn't come
 so you are getting bored? Means, I've got no value? It is what it is. Okay, forget Aima, listen to me. 
There's a good news. What? -Kinza agreed.
-What? -What for?
-She was angry with me. I had to do a lot of effort,
 then she agreed. Oh, wow, every other girl 
is getting angry with you these days. I'm serious, Zoya. -Zaid.
-Hmm? Are you actually serious with that girl? Yeah, why do you think
 that I can't fall in love with anyone? I mean I can love too,
 and I am in love with Kinza. Oh come on! Lover... I am in love. She has started coming in my dreams too. Zaid, you hardly know her since a few days
and you have fallen in love with her? Wow! It doesn't matter if love is of eight days
or eight months, it's state doesn't changes. Come on. -Should I tell you something.
-Hmm? That girl Kinza, I don't
like her, neither does Aima. Which ever girl I like, you don't like her. -You know what this means?
-What? That you love me. -I love you?
-You love me. Got you, got you!
 This is the truth, you should agree. Have you ever seen your
face in the mirror? It's so nice, what's with the face?
 I mean it's fine. -Isn't it?
-No. Okay, tell me one thing. If tomorrow, your girl, Kinza, if she has an issue with our friendship of
us three, what are you going to do then? If she has an issue with our
friendship, then I'm going to leave. So, aren't you going to make her
understand, and just leave her? No not her, I'm going to leave you two. Such a cheap guy you are, very cheap. 
Come on go away. Okay listen, let's go have some coffee. -Hey...
-I don't want to... Zaid... -Aren't you ashamed a bit?
-What's wrong, Nosheen? After humiliating me in front of my
dad, you are asking what happened? Look, whatever has happened with you,
 I am sorry about that. But believe me, I have
nothing to do with it. Really? Insolence despite your wrongdoing? -What is my fault in it, Nosheen.
-Yeah right, I'm the one at fault here. that I trusted a wolf in
sheep's clothing like you. Look, I have been calling you all night
 but I couldn't get through. Don't lie to me. I must agree, you have made 
such a great plan to trap me. What plan are you talking about, Nosheen? I have been up all night, 
waiting for you, and you are... Just stop this nonsense. I know very well
what you did while staying up all night. I have heard there was a drama
created of getting sick to trap me? What are you talking about? You know
about mother's condition very well. I am telling the truth. If she is so sick, 
why hasn't anything happened to her yet? Mind you language, she is my mother. Really? The thief scolds the police? I am well aware of the plan you and
your mother had made to get me caught. Look, you are misunderstanding me. And secondly, my mother is your aunt.
You have got a blood relation with her. To hell with such blood 
and such a relation. Why did I become unwanted {\an8}Nobody knows that Why did I become unwanted {\an8}Nobody knows that Marrying someone with my own will is my
right and it's your responsibility... I just stopped myself before hitting you
today, don't you dare say that again. Or else I won't stop then, understand? Have you ever asked Nosheen, where she
goes, when she goes and why she goes? Zaid you were going to the university then, I didn't want to spoil
your mood at that time. I wouldn't have gotten mad
with anger after knowing it, but at least I should know
what is going on in the house. You know, Dad's anger is
valid if that's the case.
