[0.00] From flowers and from buds
[4.54] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.13] When I saw you
[14.07] I learned how to chirp from you
[18.80] Zoya, what's going on?
Where has everyone gone?
[24.41] I don't know, they have gone inside.
[26.55] I think auntie needs to talk to
them about something important.
[28.98] Okay, just don't worry. It must be
something, I don't know about it right now.
[34.11] Tell them Faiq how much you love me.
[36.96] Tell them that you used to come
and meet me by ignoring Aima.
[40.05] Tell them that we have met
privately at your place and at my place.
[44.39] I'm not going to let anybody
be unfair to Nosheen.
[48.79] And Nimra, you were just
talking about asking Faiq, right?
[52.06] I just met him and he
has admitted it himself
[54.78] that he wants to marry Nosheen.
[56.43] I don't care what you want.
[59.37] If you have fixed your marriage with
Aima, then you have to marry Aima.
[65.16] Please don't get sad. I'll
come whenever you'll call me.
[70.68] I just want you to take
care of all my business.
[74.68] And I don't think Faiq would
have any objection on that.
[77.85] Yeah. Just don't worry.
I will fulfill your wish.
[85.85] Faiq tell it right in front of
everyone what is all this about?
[92.56] Tell them Faiq how much you love me.
[95.38] Tell them that you used to
ignore Aima and came to meet me.
[98.37] Tell them that we used to meet privately
sometimes at your place and sometimes at mine.
[102.56] I know what the reality is and all this
drama has been created by my daughter,
[106.88] I'm well aware of her nature.
[110.73] -Faiq is innocent.
-What are you saying?
[114.12] Quiet, if you say even a single
word more then I'm going to...
[118.60] Look, Nosheen, I've started loving you too.
[123.72] I enjoy your company, if you
aren't with me then I miss you.
[128.01] But I can't do this. I don't have
the courage to elope with you.
[136.27] Dad, please come take a look
at mother, what's wrong with her?
[140.22] Neither she is eating anything nor
she is saying anything, I'm really worried.
[143.11] -Please come and talk to her.
-Aima,
[145.87] please sit down, sit.
[152.86] I know that my sister is
going through a lot of pain
[155.53] because I'm going
through the same agony.
[159.41] Or may be I am in more pain than her.
[162.44] Because I have to take a few
decisions which will hurt a lot of people.
[166.85] I have no objection to
any of your decisions, Dad.
[174.39] Whatever you did was right.
[178.88] I know but there are still some
decisions that I need to take
[181.69] which can effect the lives of many people
but I don't care about anyone.
[188.34] The only thing I care about
right now is my sister's life.
[193.83] What are you talking about?
[199.22] Aima what I'm about to say
to you right now,
[201.32] I don't know what your response and
reaction is going to be on that.
[206.63] But I know one thing for sure that
[210.78] you might understand the
wisdom behind this decision of mine.
[215.57] Right now I'm quite perplexed.
[219.94] And I don't want you to decline
what I am going to ask.
[224.86] What? What is it, Dad?
[229.28] Aima, I
[232.23] as a father want to
[235.75] ask you
[238.31] to marry Zaid.
[252.04] No, this, what are you talking about, Dad?
[256.52] This can't be.
[260.84] My child, this has to
be done at the moment.
[264.57] Dad, me? Zaid? No, this can't happen.
[271.72] -This can't happen.
-Try to understand, dear.
[274.26] I am compelled to do so.
[276.04] No this isn't possible.
[280.79] I'm not the first girl in this world
whose marriage has been called off.
[289.26] This can't happen.
[291.07] What's the worst that can happen?
I will have a stained past, that's it.
[295.17] People are going to say
different things about me.
[299.74] I will tolerate it,
but please I can't do this.
[303.86] So, are you willing to
risk your mother's life?
[306.34] What are you saying? Why would I do that?
[310.46] Then just think of me as helpless, compelled
and I'm asking you to give a sacrifice.
[317.27] Then this time think of me as helpless
[321.72] Whatever you have asked me till
now I did it, I never said no to you.
[331.02] If you had asked for my
life, I would have given it.
[335.38] I wouldn't have denied.
[338.68] But I won't be able to do it.
[341.02] To make my own home I
can't ruin anyone else's home.
[349.01] I can't do this.
[350.57] I know.
[352.96] Aima, I know what you are saying is right.
[356.69] But the question here
is of my sister's life.
[363.16] I beg of you.
[370.57] Don't play with her life.
She will die because of this trauma.
[376.84] You may be able to live in any condition but
she won't be able to bear this pain of yours.
[380.10] And if anything happens to her at least
I won't be able to forgive myself, Aima.
[385.93] I won't be able to forgive myself.
[459.51] Get hold of yourself, Dad.
[463.64] I am unable to face Aima and Shabana, Zaid.
[469.14] I can understand.
[472.71] That girl considers me as her father.
[477.92] And I have become responsible
for her misery in just a moment.
[482.61] Dad, please don't blame yourself, 
you have no fault in all this.
[485.96] How isn't it our fault? It is.
[489.99] My daughter has snatched what
was Aima's, it's all because of her.
[496.11] And we won't be able to
get rid of all this so easily.
[501.58] And I am the one who is suffering 
the most because I have to take decisions.
[507.40] My decisions might hurt a lot of people.
[510.57] But right now I don't care
about anyone.
[512.46] The only thing I care about is my sister's
life, which is most important to me.
[525.34] Zaid.
[528.54] if I ask you something, 
ask something from you, would you say no?
[536.55] Sure, Dad.
[540.61] I hope that you won't say no, Zaid.
[545.91] Dad, tell me without hesitating what I can
do so that we cam get rid of our problems.
[550.63] Zaid,
[553.04] I want you to marry Aima.
[590.56] You wanted to know, then answer me.
[594.70] Yes he is interested in you.
[599.22] Okay, but how can you say that?
[602.96] Because Faiq has told me himself, he
likes you, he wants to know about you.
[608.25] He is really excited
about this relationship.
[611.50] What's wrong Aima? Why
are you so unsure about Faiq?
[615.72] Tell me today, share everything with me.
[617.95] Zaid, I have a feeling that auntie is
forcing Faiq to marry me, he doesn't like me.
[626.11] -But why do you feel that way?
-Because
[630.77] because nobody likes me, Zaid.
[641.86] Zaid, I didn't get married.
[651.62] Aima, Aima look at me.
[656.30] Aima, just look here. I promise I won't
let anything wrong happen with you.
[661.18] Do you listen?
[664.30] Neither Faiq can't do anything,
nor will I let Nosheen do anything.
[673.06] Don't worry, everything
is going to be back to normal.
[686.09] I have told mom what I had to say,
I have given my response.
[688.73] Say it in front of everyone.
[691.91] What are you going to respond.
[694.12] I know that Nosheen's allegations
aren't false but true.
[698.31] And I also know that you didn't go to 
the restaurant that day for a business meeting
[702.14] but you went with Nosheen,
and still I kept quiet.
[705.02] I kept quiet because
I couldn't see Aima in pain.
[708.63] But I don't like Aima but Nosheen.
[710.81] I don't care what you want.
[724.60] They are married, and they left too.
[732.64] Mama, got the dinner served.
[736.95] There weren't many people remaining but
[740.32] those who were there ate.
[743.88] Mama, asked me to tell you guys
that she was tired so she left for home.
[750.64] I feel that uncle and you
should have been there.
[755.41] Everyone was asking about you.
[759.55] I know that Nosheen has done
very wrong but she is your only sister.
[765.62] You could have come when
she was leaving just as a formality.
[769.95] But it's all right, she has left now.
[774.55] Don't worry, Zaid.
[776.62] We are worried too, but what can be done.
[783.09] I'm really sorry, Zoya.
[786.79] For what?
[791.54] Look, Zaid, it's not your fault, okay?
[796.52] Stop blaming yourself.
[799.01] And besides if you are going to lose
hope, who is going to take care of Aima?
[806.01] She depends on us so much.
[809.14] I will have to support Aima, Zoya.
[811.90] That's what I'm saying, that
only you have to support her.
[816.66] I know.
[819.55] That's why I'll have to marry her.
[988.64] -Zaid, where are you going in the middle of the night?
-Dad, Zoya isn't home. She has gone somewhere.
[994.51] Her phone is switched off too, I don't know
where she is. I'm going to look for her.
[997.91] I know that she must have been shocked.
[1004.27] I know that she isn't home right now.
[1007.22] And it is important for
her to stay away right now.
[1010.64] Dad, how can I leave her like that.
It's middle of the night.
[1014.10] Why are you getting worried? Where
would she go other than her house?
[1019.61] She will take a little
time to accept this fact.
[1024.50] Which she is going to do soon.
[1026.23] It is the reality, and it's
important for her to accept it.
[1031.55] Give her as much time as she wants. I know
that this must be a difficult time for her.
[1036.74] At one point it was my wish that
you and Aima would get married.
[1041.18] But it has become my compulsion today.
[1043.77] Don't you ever think that I
have fulfilled my wish by doing so.
[1049.24] I know, Dad.
[1050.26] I did what was really
important to do right now.
[1053.66] Don't worry about her she
must have gone to Amber.
[1057.96] But, Dad, try to understand, half the
night has passed. I can't leave her alone.
[1061.76] You try to understand, Zaid.
[1065.25] Even if you go to her right now, 
she would never listen to you.
[1068.72] Give her some time. Right now you
should be there where you are needed.
[1073.61] Please.
[1076.77] Cool down, dear.
[1096.96] Remember, when I used
to stay up all night missing you
[1100.19] then my eyes
used to turn like that too.
[1103.38] Stop being so dramatic.
[1105.48] Okay, listen, should I tell Aima?
[1110.00] What?
[1123.18] Zaid,
[1128.28] I like you.
[1135.47] I like you a lot.
[1146.13] -You should be more concerned about Zaid.
-What do you mean?
[1149.76] Aima, we both are his best friends. If we
aren't concerned about him who else would be?
[1154.01] Now, look, I'm so worried about her.
[1218.38] Will I every praise you falsely?
[1223.57] Thank you.
[1224.86] Zoya, what is this nonsense?
[1228.94] What's wrong?
[1230.08] I mean, aren't you going to praise me?
[1235.12] By looking at you, it
seems as if you are
[1238.53] attending a poetic gathering
to recite your poetry.
[1292.47] Shakoor.
[1297.78] Shakoor bring my breakfast.
[1301.52] And after giving me breakfast, 
water the plants.
[1310.16] Should I call Zoya?
[1313.84] She might be sleeping. 
Let me send her a text.
[1317.67] If she is up she will call me.
[1326.73] You? At this time?
[1330.31] Who did you come with?
[1332.29] Where is Zaid? Why don't you say something?
[1335.95] What's wrong my child?
[1338.28] Zoya?
[1339.83] Zoya, tell me, is everything
all right back home?
[1343.48] What's wrong?
[1345.84] Mom,
[1347.29] Zaid and Aima are married.
[1352.03] What?
[1354.11] Their marriage? When?
[1357.39] How?
[1383.92] Have you found peace now?
[1386.11] Are you content?
[1388.17] You have destroyed everything.
[1390.42] There is a limit of doing
your own will, Azmat.
[1393.20] To take your niece's revenge
[1397.19] you have destroyed my son 
and my niece's marriage.
[1404.31] How am I going to face my sister?
[1409.31] I consider this marriage as invalid.
[1411.90] Don't know what you said or threatened to do
to my son that he agreed for this marriage.
[1419.88] And a marriage which is forced is invalid.
[1422.72] If you don't believe me go ask
anyone, this marriage is not valid.
[1429.38] And as far as your niece
is concerned, it was her fate.
[1436.81] Faiq rejected her. My Nosheen
has nothing to do with it.
[1443.94] Don't you get this simple thing?
[1448.18] You stubbornness has destroyed everything.
[1451.77] Our happiness, you are the murderer,
[1458.41] you are responsible 
for all this destruction.
[1461.35] My children, my children.
[1465.98] You weren't even able
[1468.97] to be there when your only daughter
was departing after getting married.
[1472.28] She has left like an orphan.
[1474.55] You weren't even able to give you
her blessings while she was leaving.
[1482.15] Tell me, how can be a person so rigid?
[1487.96] Who, who can be like that?
[1492.08] But who am I complaining to?
[1496.67] A person who has got no feelings.
[1501.74] Who can just see himself, his
will, his pride and his happiness.
[1506.40] Why would he care 
about anyone else's sorrow?
[1512.10] You used to say it to me, 
today I am going to say it to you,
[1515.58] You are an unsuccessful
husband and an unsuccessful father.
[1523.04] Remember what I am saying, Azmat.
[1526.08] You will be left all alone
[1528.02] because of your pride, arrogance
and because of doing your will only.
[1535.64] Why are you quiet? Say it, tell
me, answer me, Azmat. Tell me.
[1541.61] You have destroyed everything, 
Azmat, everything.
[1545.08] You are the murderer of our happiness.
[1551.30] You want an answer?
[1553.79] This is the answer to your questions.
[1558.76] Got it?
[1560.77] You want any more answers?
[1564.41] All the hearts that are
broken in this house,
[1566.20] all the destruction that has happened,
you are the culprit of all that.
[1569.29] Only you.
[1571.49] All that has happened wrong and
the destruction is because of you.
[1574.84] Keep that in your mind.
[1597.07] I can't believe, we are married now.
[1600.57] Everything seems so nice, Faiq.
[1602.99] Till yesterday it seemed as if everything has
ended, and now look, everything is changed.
[1610.37] Everything is so nice.
[1613.13] And thank you so much that you stood by me.
[1616.44] Or else Aima would have been 
sitting here in my place.
[1622.90] Why are you sitting
like this with a long face?
[1626.69] What's the use of sacrificing so much?
[1629.59] We have made all the elder
angry just for our happiness.
[1633.38] Please, Nosheen, I'm in a bad
mood right now. Leave me alone.
[1636.71] I don't like it at all when you
sit with a long face like this.
[1644.01] We are a perfect couple, aren't we?
[1646.40] Which always stays happy with each other.
[1648.94] How can I be joyful so soon, Nosheen?
[1652.29] When I don't feel good at all.
[1655.94] -About what?
-This, whatever we have done.
[1660.73] We have hurt everyone
just for our happiness.
[1662.82] Faiq, you don't need to feel bad at all.
[1667.29] Really? And what about Aima?
[1670.61] I have told you 
that she is married to brother now.
[1673.42] And you know it that she would
always have chosen brother.
[1679.13] Nosheen, Zaid already has a wife.
[1682.47] Well, Aima must be okay with that,
that's why this marriage took place.
[1688.01] Otherwise, think for yourself,
[1689.69] when dad didn't force you to marry Aima, how
could he force Aima or brother to get married?
[1699.98] So, just relax and don't worry.
[1702.94] I can't relax until mom is angry with me.
[1709.39] Don't know if she is every going to
talk to me or not, I don't know anything.
[1714.60] Faiq, I promise, I'm going to take care of
her so much that she is going to forget Aima.
[1719.64] Just don't worry.
[1722.32] Anyway, tell me where are
we going for our honeymoon?
[1726.87] I don't know, 
I haven't thought about it yet.
[1729.52] How rude.
[1732.09] Okay, mama must be coming with breakfast.
[1736.12] I think no one else would accompany her.
[1738.69] Why don't you go and get ready?
[1742.84] I'm not in the mood, 
just meet her yourself.
[1746.18] Hey!
[1783.88] Aima,
[1786.00] did you have breakfast?
[1791.70] Where is Zaid?
[1794.66] I don't know.
[1799.87] Look, dear, whatever that has happened
[1806.71] consider it as your fate.
[1809.10] May be all this was
supposed to happen this way.
[1816.84] Did you talk to Zaid?
[1819.89] Did he say anything?
[1822.75] No.
[1824.84] -Did he?
-He didn't come to my room.
[1835.07] Mother, Nosheen isn't that type of a girl.
[1837.43] You are thinking wrong of her.
[1839.00] You don't need to tell me
 what kind of a girl she is.
[1841.73] I know her very well.
[1846.03] She is a very clever and cunning girl,
[1849.27] whom I can never respect.
[1852.00] Aima,
[1854.30] everyone is blaming me.
[1856.37] I haven't committed any sin either, Dad,
[1859.26] but I am being judged as well.
[1861.12] If you will get angry with me too, 
where am I going to go?
[1864.92] You are the only one who understands me.
[1867.23] You are standing here with so much
confidence after disgracing yourself.
[1871.62] Don't forget that you 
are present in my home.
[1876.15] She is your elder.
[1878.20] She may be an elder in her house.
[1881.23] All her tantrums are because you
have given her so much leverage.
