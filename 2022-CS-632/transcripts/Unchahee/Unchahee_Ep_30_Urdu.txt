From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned to chirp from you Oh, hello! What a surprise! Where have you been, Zoya?
I've been waiting for you for so long. Nosheen, what are you doing here? Faiq I wanted to talk to you about something
important that's why I had to come. Try to resolve your own problems. I don't know what is going to happen
to you both when I'll move to my in laws. We'll wait for you to visit so that
we can place our case in your court. You have made your dresses for your
brother's wedding with so much difficulty. Why haven't you made
any dresses for Aima's wedding? Let's see if this wedding
takes place or not. I guess, whatever happened
shouldn't have happened. Yeah we both got a little over emotional. Never mind, our issues
are sorted out now, aren't they? Right. By the way tell me about your shoot. What's
the brand, where's the shoot gonna happen? Oh, yeah, I forgot to tell you that? It's a multi-national food company,
it's their shoot. And for that I need to go to Dubai. Zoya, youâ€™re going to Dubai
and you didn't even tell me? How could have I told you?
You didn't give me a chance to tell you. I came home and you started
venting your anger out on me. But you could have told me
before you were leaving. -You know , Zaid, why didn't I share it with you?
-Why? Because I am scared
that I would have to take decisions about my own career with
someone else's permission. But, Zoya, I'm not someone else,
I'm going to be your husband. And what are you scared of? Nothing, I'm just scared that if I
get used to ask for permissions my career might suffer. Zoya, you know
that I am serious about your passion. I would never let your career suffer. And I'm not saying that you
should get permission from me,  it's just that you can inform me about it. I mean we should know
about each other's lives, don't we? You're right, Zaid. I should have told you. But I have signed the contract now,
and I'm going to go to Dubai. Okay, listen, I was just thinking
if you could tell dad too before leaving. Zaid, the way I am, I can't do all this. It's my personal life
and it's my own decision. Yeah, but he is the elder of the house,
I think you should share it once with him too. And what if he has any objection? No, I don't think he is going
to have any objection. It's just that he'll feel respected,
he'll fell good. And you have shared it
with auntie too, haven't you? Of course I sat and talked to her.
I share everything with her. Then do it with dad too.
I mean for my sake, Zoya, please. He's the eldest in the house. Okay, Zaid, I'll talk to him. Thank you, means a lot. Sister Nimra, there was no need
of this formality. You didn't need to do all this shopping,
all this stuff, these clothes. It's a joyous event
and it should be celebrated like that. Besides, I wish that
nothing lacks for Aima. None of her desire
shouldn't be left unfulfilled. Shabana, wasn't our Aima looking
so beautiful in that dress? Yeah. She was looking gorgeous. But sister Nimra,
your choice is amazing too. To tell you the truth I'm really happy for Aima. I know, and I'm very happy too. I wanted to talk to you
about something since a few days. I don't know if you'll agree to it or not. Tell me what is it? Shabana, I'm already telling you,
please don't mind. And never doubt my intentions. Just consider it a little wish that I have. Just talk to me, you can say anything to me,
I will never mind. And I hope that after
listening to what I have to say, you are going to give me
a positive response. Oh come on, now tell me what it is. I'm wondering what is it
that you want to say? Actually, Shabana, I want
that after Aima's marriage you move here too. I really want this. And you know, Faiq wants that too. Sister, Actually, this isn't possible. Why, Shabana? What's wrong with that? I'm your husband's sister. Consider me as your real sister. Look, if you'll move here
we will live in peace. And when you'll see Aima living happily,
yourself, you'll be content. That's your and Faiq's greatness. I'm happy that you have thought
about me so generously. But, may God bless my brother. I'm content at his place. He for me and I for him
are a source of peace in that house. And in my opinion brother would also never want
that when he is there I should live in your house instead of his. Look, Shabana, eventually
it will be your decision. But I would really want you to agree to it. That's your love for me. That's why I'm saying, move here,
we'll live together. And our love is going to increase too. Yeah. Okay, I'll talk to brother
and will let you know then. -Try your best.
-Sure. Anyway, did you see the colors? -Do you want to talk about something?
-Yeah. Uncle, I'd like to take your permission, I like it Zoya that you asked
for my permission. You are the eldest of the house. And had dad been alive today then I would have asked
for his permission too. You're right. If you want to follow your passion
then you have my permission. -Thank you, uncle.
-Welcome. But I'd like to give you an advice. Sure, go ahead. You are getting married. And you know well that after getting
married the responsibilities increase. I'll be happy if you keep your focus on your
responsibilities more than your hobbies. Now, please, I don't mean it at all
that you should limit yourself to it. Passion and enjoyment is one thing, but one's real focus should be
on one's home and married life. Yes, all right. Did you have tea or anything? -No, would you like to have some?
-Yes, please. Why isn't Faiq picking up? -Hello.
-What the hell is wrong with you? Why do you keep calling me? Faiq, why weren't you picking up my call? Because I didn't want to.
And don't call me again like this. Faiq, please talk to me,
I have been missing you for so long. You know, I was with Aima.
What if she found out? I don't care whatever she thinks. But I care,
I've told you everything, clearly. I thought you must have understood by now,
but you are still stuck there. That's what I don't get,
Faiq why I can't find peace. I just know one thing, that I love you Nosheen, you're creating
a lot of problems for me. Try to understand,
what you want isn't possible. Faiq, please don't do this to me. I am not doing anything, Nosheen,
you are the one doing everything. -Okay, please just meet me once.
-No. Faiq, please I love you. I beg you, please meet me just once. Look, Nosheen, don't embarrass me
like this, please. -So, please, meet me then.
-Why shall I meet you? I have explained you everything,
why can't you understand me? Look, Nosheen, please don't cry. I'm heart broken, Faiq. Okay, just stop crying, please. Okay, then promise me
that you're going to meet me. Are we meeting then? Okay, I will see. But there is nothing as such between us. Don't lie, you know
that there is something. Now you aren't accepting
it, that's a different story. Really? What am I not accepting? That you love me but you're marrying Aima. Look, Nosheen... -Did you order anything?
-Yeah, I've ordered and for you too. Thank you. What was it that you couldn't
tell me over the phone? I have a solution for our problem. Which problem. The problem which is going on
between us, Faiq. I'm talking about that. But there is no problem between us. Don't lie. You know it that
there is something between us. But if you don't want to accept
then that's a different story. Really? And what am I not accepting? That you love me but you are marrying Aima. Look Nosheen, all this is going to create
even more problems for us. So, it's better
that we don't talk about it. -But why, Faiq?
-Because there is no solution to this problem. When there is a will there is a way.
And if you'll ask me, I have a solution. Okay, what is it? And please don't
give any solution which I can't accept. Such as? Anything by which my mother
gets angry. I can't hurt her. Now tell me what it is. Faiq, I think that we should elope. We don't have any other option than this. What do you think, will our families agree? Neither your mom, nor my dad. And Aima is going to create
such a scene that after that I don't know what
dad and brother are going to do to me. Look, this is the only option we have.
Let's get our marriage solemnized. Our families will be mad at us
for a little time but eventually they will agree. No, Nosheen, this isn't possible. I can't hurt mom. Faiq, are you a school going kid that you
need your mom's permission for everything? Be a man, take your own decisions. I don't know what to tell you. Give me a minute.
I need to use the washroom. Excuse me. Thank you, all right. What a pleasant surprise, you here? Yeah, I had a meeting with my client
that's why I came here. -I thought you came with Aima.
-Aima? No I'm alone. Actually, I'm here with Zoya.
She is leaving for Dubai. So, I thought of having lunch together. Oh, by the way, when you
get free then feel free to join us. Yeah, sure. Amber, it's like you've just vanished.
You don't call, you don't visit. I have been busy lately. Office work and then wedding preparations. Zoya doesn't take any interest in all this. Yeah, that's true, I thought
you are angry at what Azmat said. Yes, you are right. After all he said something that it's valid for me to get angry. Am I wrong? -Yes, you're right.
-Well, you can see yourself. I just don't understand,
what is wrong with brother Azmat? Her daughter in law
is going to be someone else but all his favors
are for someone else. He will ignore Zoya
and take Aima to his office with him. Why doesn't he understand that
Aima belongs to some other house. That's totally unfair with my daughter. Don't worry, I'll talk to Azmat. With due apologies, I don't think
he pays any heed to what you say. He does what he wants, his own will. -Don't worry, Amber.
-How can I not worry? I see my daughter's future insecure. What sort of insecurity? Well, the way your husband
is being unfair and doing his own will. He doesn't even like his own children, why
would he think about his daughter in law? It's not like that, Amber,
you are overreacting. What's wrong in it?
Hasn't brother Azmat disowned Hammad? Hasn't he kept any contact with Nosheen? Tell me, where am I wrong here? And if tomorrow he dislikes
anything done by Zaid,  he is going to throw him out as well, and who is going to suffer? My daughter. No, Amber, Zaid is his favorite child. You'll see.
You can expect anything from him. If he dislikes anything done by Zaid,
he is going to disown Zaid and give all his property to Aima. I just don't get it, I have seen
such a guy for the first time in my life Who thinks more about
someone else's child than his own children. What is it that Aima does
which your children haven't done? Amber, the thing is he feels pity
for her more than love. Because she is an orphan. Otherwise he actually loves his children. Please excuse me, but I can't digest
what is going on in front of my eyes. You might be used to tolerate
him being unfair to you kids, but I won't tolerate
any injustice to my child. If I see anything like that then... What are you talking
about, Amber? I'm her aunt, I won't let anything wrong
happen to her in this house. Yeah, I kept quiet considering it earlier. But after looking the situation
in your home now, I had to speak up. Look, I want to make it clear to you. If my daughter is deprived of her rights
in this house then I won't stay quiet. I'm not such an insignificant woman that even if something wrong
is being done to my daughter in her in laws and don't say anything. I know very well how to chide everyone,
and you know that very well. Trust me , Amber,
have faith in me I'm your sister. Right now I'm not your sister
but the mother of your daughter in law. You must understand this clearly
and make others understand that too. If anybody is unfair
to my daughter or mistreats her then I... I won't spare him,
be it an elder or someone young. -Did you see? Nosheen was here.
-Nosheen? With whom? No idea, she just left. Are you sure it was Nosheen? Yeah, I'm 100% sure. I looked closely, it was Nosheen. She just got up and went,
and she was alone. Yeah, actually I had a meeting
with a client that's why I came here. I thought you came with Aima. By the way, what were you doing there? I just went to ask the manager
if they accept credit cards or not. You did the right thing, or else you
would have had to wash dishes after lunch and I would have had to take
a cab to reach the airport. Very funny. Oh by the way, guess who I met. -Who?
-Faiq. Oh, that's surprising.
It's such a small world. -Was Aima with him too?
-No, he said he was here for a meeting. -Oh, okay.
-But I've told him if he gets free early he should feel free
to join us. If that's okay with you. Yeah, it's totally fine.
You did the right thing to tell him. If he is here we could have a chat. Aima is going
to be really happy too if I'll tell her. By the way, I don't see him,
where is he sitting? He must be here somewhere,
may be inside. Don't see him, I think he has left too. What can I say. Anyway,
tell me what did you order? I ordered butter chicken. Okay, listen, please wait in the car,
I'll just be there in a minute. Excuse me, this gentleman who was here
a while ago, in the camel color jacket, -Who sir?
-The one I was talking to right here. -Oh , yes, yes.
-Who was he with? He came with a lady. So, he had to leave due to an emergency. Emergency. Sir, he canceled his order as well. Come, Shabana, come. -Your tea.
-Thank you. I was just thinking about you. Really? But you were reading. So can't anyone think
about anybody while reading? One thing is for sure, nobody can
make tea like you do in this house. What's up? What are you thinking about? Actually, brother, I was at sister Nimra's house when she expressed her wish to me. What kind of wish? Look, brother, I tried to say no but
after she insisted too much... I've told her that I'll let her know
after asking brother. Carry on, I'm listening. Brother, sister Nimra wants that... I... go to her place. Well, go then, when do you want to go? No... brother, she means... that after Aima gets married I move to her place permanently. Has anybody said anything
to you in this house? No, it's nothing like that. Then did you mind anything I said? Brother, I have no complains here. and then... you've kept me here with so much love. You have taken care of me
more than I could imagine. I have no complains living here. -I'm happy and content.
-Then? Initially I declined
sister Nimra's suggestion too. But now I'm thinking that
the situation here at home is changing. What do you mean? Look, brother, Zaid is getting married. Your daughter in law is coming
to the house by the grace of God. And tomorrow they
are going to have a family here. Brother, I don't want that because of me someone's life is disturbed. Look, Shabana, I know that a lot of hurtful
things are said to you in this house which you don't mention to me at all. But know that for sure
that I am your guardian. You might be a burden for someone else,
but for me you are my only sister. Your only shelter is this house. Until I'm alive,
you won't go anywhere from here. Okay, brother, sure. You got my tea cold. -I'll make some again for you.
-Yeah. Nosheen, you should be thankful 
that God saved us. -Why?
-What do you mean why? Aren't you scared? 
What if Zaid saw us together? So what if he saw us? 
Why are you so scared all the time? Look, my fear is valid. If Zaid had seen us together 
there would have been a chaos. And look, I'm committed to Aima. What would have I told him, 
who was with me, why were you with me? Had it been some unknown girl 
I would have said that she's an old friend. So can there be old friends only? 
Not new ones? And I'm your friend. And even if had seen us, 
it's not a big issues. I would have told him. He goes out with Aima all the time too. And Aima is committed with you, isn't she? You didn't need to tell me that. And I don't care about Aima's activities. Why? you should know about Aima. 
All she has to do is with Zaid only. I just don't understand 
what is she going to do after marriage. How is she going to live without Zaid? Why do you say all these things 
to me again and again? Look it doesn't make any difference to me. 
Everyone has a a past. This means you have a past as well. Did you also have an affair? Just one? Means multiple times? Love affairs? Yeah, you can say that. Faiq, look, just listen to me. Please listen to me and marry me. I promise everything
is going to be all right. Look, Nosheen, I have fallen in love with you too. I enjoy your company.
I start missing you if you aren't with me. But,  can't do this. I don't have the courage to elope with you. -We can do it, Faiq.
-It's too late. I can't go against mom's will. -Mama.
-Yeah? Where did Nosheen go today? When? Today. Where else would she go. She might
have gone to college before I got up. She should have been in college
but I saw her somewhere else. I don't get you, what are you saying? I saw Nosheen at the restaurant today. Are you aware of that? No, who was she with? You should know that. She must have been with a friend. Which friend? I don't know about that. What sort of an answer is this? Even after so much has happened 
you are still not bothered? You should be aware of each 
and every moment of hers. What's wrong if she has gone
to the restaurant for a while? Mama, how can you be 
so careless when it come to her? Look, Zaid, why are you always after her? I agree that she has committed a mistake.
Are we going to doubt her all her life? And why do you keep tracking 
what she is up to? Look, if she is even trying
to correct and changer herself so she will change her mind 
by all this questioning and interrogation. Mama, I'm his elder brother. 
I am entitled to know about her activities. Zaid, if you like to be
his big brother, then just sit with her, talk
to her and discuss with her. I'll treat her well 
when she becomes worth it. But right now, something else is going on. -Do you have any idea who she went with?
-No. Why? Didn't she find
it important to tell you ? Don't you go to several places 
without telling me. There is a lot of difference
between these do things, mama I know the world. Besides, I'm not stopping her 
from going anywhere. She can sure go but 
at least inform you about it. All right, I'll ask her when she returns. Mama, just look at the time, 
she is still not home. Please be serious. Before something new happens. Okay, wait, I have to talk to you. 
Why are you leaving like that? -Go ahead.
-I have invited Hammad at the wedding. Did you ask dad? I won't take permission 
for everything from your dad. Hammad is my son and it's an even of
our home. Why shouldn't he be part of it? That's okay mama, 
but the way he misbehaved and left home I don't think dad would like it. He hasn't even apologized for his mistake. What is it that your dad likes about us?
The most he can do is get angry. I'll take his scolding. Just do one thing. Tell your dad 
that you invited him when he arrives. Mom... Please don't say no now. You are my son, 
can't you do even this for your mom? Is everything all right? Yeah, everything is fine. He must be busy with his business. I'm sure he'll call me when he is free. Don't you have any manners? 
Why are you checking my phone? Why is Faiq sending you messages? Mind your own business. Nosheen I'm your elder brother, 
I have the right to know. Aima, I think you 
are hiding something from me. Why would I hide anything from you? I have noticed that you have been
very disturbed through out the wedding. And I didn't find it normal. What's wrong with you? Nothing. Zaid, look at her eyes.
