[0.03] From flowers and from buds
[4.59] I have learnt to bloom and be fragrant
[9.16] When I saw you
[14.12] I learned how to chirp from you
[18.81] What news did he get through messages
due to which he got so worried?
[22.92] You know, he doesn't talk
to anyone when he is worried.
[25.49] He sent Mama and Nosheen
out of his room too.
[29.90] He has asked me that...
[33.32] whatever proposals Aima has got, consider
them and whichever seems suitable,
[40.10] get Aima married as soon as possible.
[46.14] Do you remember, Dad?
[48.25] When you left your phone,
I brought it back to you.
[52.47] I have seen everything, Dad.
And I know why you are worried.
[63.21] Where are you, Zaid?
[65.74] Why is he disconnecting my call?
[68.78] Yes, Zaid, where are you both?
[71.46] Everyone has submitted their files.
[79.36] -He has seen the message but not replied?
-Hello.
[83.50] So weird of them.
[85.46] Listen, I've messaged you,
you have seen it but haven't replied.
[89.29] Aima isn't picking my call either.
Where are you guys.
[96.68] You guys just go to hell.
I am going to submit my file.
[114.31] You will go to the university alone
from now on, Aima won't go with you.
[133.27] Dad, you wanted me
to take interest in domestic issues.
[136.24] And now when I'm asking you
[138.09] about what is happening at home
then you aren't telling me.
[141.82] Look, son, I want you
to take interest in domestic issues,
[145.98] But I don't want you to ask me questions.
[157.38] There was a reason that I didn't tell you.
[160.16] Whatever the reason is, Aima,
[161.58] there is just one justification for it
and that is that you don't trust me.
[167.01] I have no importance in your life.
[170.39] It's nothing like that, Zaid.
Please try to understand.
[175.06] Such a huge thing happened and even
Zoya didn't let me know about it?
[178.31] I kept asking you both
over and over again
[180.23] to please tell me what is
the problem, share with me,
[183.35] And every time you guys avoided answering
it by talking about something else,
[185.76] as if I were a kid. As if you were
avoiding something a kid is asking.
[212.92] Zaid, please pick up the phone.
[226.43] Why aren't you picking up?
[241.44] Oh, God, what is happening to me.
[247.87] Everyone is angry with me.
[252.29] I don't understand anything.
[255.85] At least you should pick up the phone.
[271.97] Aima.
[278.32] Yes, Mother?
[279.63] Aima, is everything all right?
You didn't go to university today.
[284.20] And you said it's important
for you to go today.
[288.14] I'll handle it, Mother.
[295.90] Aima, were you crying?
[300.25] No, I wasn't.
[304.81] Did anybody say something to you?
Sister or Nosheen?
[309.94] Mother, no one has said anything to me.
[312.53] I'm okay. I am just a little unwell.
[318.68] You are unwell?
Did you eat something?
[323.30] -Yes, I... I had my breakfast.
-Rally?
[330.07] Okay, listen if you aren't feeling well
let's go to the doctor to get you checked,
[335.26] I'll call brother...
[337.66] Mother, just stay with me.
Sit here with me.
[341.53] I will start feeling well myself.
[354.41] Aima, Aima dear,
[358.87] why do I feel like you are
hiding something from me?
[364.45] No, Mother, it's nothing like that.
Just... just pray for me.
[386.98] Greetings, auntie. You
came after so long.
[391.52] Everything all right?
[394.62] Yes. I didn't want to come
even today, but what can I do?
[399.97] Sister has been calling me since many days
[401.59] and I don't refuse what
elders ask me to do.
[404.75] That's good, you should keep visiting.
[408.31] After all you can say
your heart out to mama only.
[412.05] See, your friend is here.
[413.86] Mama was thinking that you won't
come here ever again for no reason.
[417.60] Did you greet your aunt?
[419.87] Oh, Mama, why wouldn't I?
She is my real aunt.
[424.72] And no matter how the real relatives are,
we should give them the utmost importance.
[433.72] Nosheen answer me
as much as I have asked you.
[436.80] Go and get some tea and supper ready
for you aunt Amber.
[439.61] Go now, go.
[441.13] All right.
[447.38] By the way, sister, I was expecting
a little improvement in her behaviour.
[453.08] Why? Didn't Nosheen greet you?
[456.02] I am not talking
about her greeting me or not.
[458.73] At least she should have apologized
to me on her previous behaviour.
[464.76] Amber, she is very sorry
[467.04] but I think she must be feeling
shy apologizing in front of you.
[472.19] Anyway, I think she is never ashamed.
[475.98] Okay forget it, tell me
have you come alone?
[480.12] No, Zoya is with me.
[483.61] Really? I didn't see her.
[486.16] You know well why she comes
to your home.
[491.23] She said she is going to meet Zaid
and Aima and then come here.
[494.07] Yes of course,
they both are her only relatives.
[496.81] Anyway, whatever she feels
is right for her.
[500.05] Sister, you were trying
to tell me something over the phone.
[504.01] Yes, I forgot to give you
the breaking news.
[506.79] Aima has been caught red-handed.
[511.30] -Doing what?
-She went to meet a guy at his home.
[518.23] How did you know?
[520.20] Don't know that guy is of what calibre.
He sent obscene pictures to Azmat too.
[526.56] He is blackmailing too.
[530.30] What does that guy want?
[532.91] What would he want? Either Aima or money.
[537.25]  You know, Azmat doesn't tell anything.
[540.81] My God! These mother daughter pose how
pious they are in front of the world
[546.26] and look what they do secretly.
[548.95] Oh, yes, they have fooled everyone.
[554.66] By they way, sister,
one thing is clear after this incident.
[559.27] -What's that.
-That this girl isn't after Zaid.
[563.92] Really, I never thought about this thing.
[567.81] Besides, Zaid is interested
in a girl named Kinza.
[571.51] I have seen them talking.
[574.48] Really? That's good news.
[578.20] Actually, Amber, I was thinking
of something since many days.
[583.29] Then say it sister. If you aren't going to
tell me then will you tell it to Shabana?
[589.40] I wish Zoya and Zaid would like each other
[593.94] and we could get them both married.
[598.96] Sister, it would be so fortunate for me
[603.79] if my daughter becomes
your daughter-in-law.
[607.51]  -But...
-But, what?
[610.86] Sister, I will have to talk to Zoya.
[614.12] I don't want to do anything
without her consent.
[616.99] Well then why don't you ask Zoya
and I ask Zaid if he likes her.
[624.47] Yes, you talk to Zoya
and I'll talk to Zaid.
[629.53] Actually I mentioned it once
in front of her.
[632.67] But she didn't show much interest.
[636.84] And I can't get her married
without her consent...
[641.84] You get my point?
I don't want to force her.
[644.90] Where ever she wants, and with who
ever she wants to get married,
[646.70] be it Zaid or anyone else, I am
going to get her married there.
[657.96] Zaid, I am not Aima,
so behave yourself, okay?
[661.30] Then don't listen, go from here.
[663.65] I am a savage person,
I start beating up people walking by.
[667.68] It's not like that, Zaid.
[669.42] Why did I get unwanted
[674.00] Nobody knows that
[678.72] Why did I get unwanted
[683.26] Nobody knows that
[738.84] What is this childish behaviour?
[743.45] Zaid, I'm talking to you, answer me.
[748.51] I have got no answer.
[752.20] What's your problem?
[755.00] I don't have any answer
to the questions from both of you.
[760.02] Do you even know what you are saying?
[762.45] Do you have any idea
what you both have done?
[765.48] What was this childish behaviour?
Whatever it is, bear it yourself.
[769.70] Zaid, she wanted to share it
with you, but...
[771.91] You guys have no reason, just excuses.
[775.17] We have a reason. If you had
talked to Aima peacefully,
[778.59] she would have told you
the reason as well.
[781.66] And you know why Aima didn't tell you this?
[783.75] Because she was afraid you might do
something stupid when you are alone.
[787.83] -And what did you think?
-You won't believe me,
[791.15] but I wanted to get you involved in this.
[793.44] And what benefit did you guys get with
hiding it from me? Is the matter solved?
[797.76] Where did this cool
and composed nature took her?
[802.97] Rather she is in trouble. How is
she going to go to university now?
[807.75] That's what I'm saying Zaid
that you should support her,
[810.44] so that uncle believes her.
[812.78] You know what, Zoya, I just don't care.
[816.72] So, are you going
to leave her just like that?
[818.83] Yeah, do whatever you both like.
[822.59] Zaid, I am not Aima,
so behave yourself, okay?
[825.87] Then don't listen, go from here.
[828.23] I am a savage person,
I start beating up people walking by.
[832.46] It's not like that, Zaid.
[835.13] I just don't know how
to solve such matters,
[837.31] so why are you discussing it
with me? Please leave.
[840.04] -Zaid, will you stop being so stubborn?
-No.
[843.32] You both have hurt me,
that too just to save a cheap guy.
[847.97] If I got to lay my hands on him I would
have buried him ten feet under the ground.
[851.62] I think Aima has done right,
not to tell you.
[854.06] because honestly you have no idea
what you say and do when you are angry.
[858.35] Zaid, I just came to say that,
what's done is done.
[861.94] Now, just talk to her and support her.
[868.89] Because she needs you right now.
[894.70] You took so long to get back today.
[897.56] Yes, I had too much to do at office today.
[901.08] Would you like to tell me something?
[905.40] What is it?
[907.32] -Azmat, I am complaining to you.
-What for?
[912.22] Such a huge incident happened in the house
and you didn't even mention it to me?
[917.39] Almas, if you are
not concerned with something
[921.46] I don't think it is important for me
to mention it in front of you.
[923.66] Yes, of course, it would have
been only concerned with me
[926.14]  if it was mine or Nosheen's fault.
[930.37] Right? Or if you were criticizing us.
[933.78] -It's not like that.
-It is like that, Azmat.
[936.84] You couldn't have criticized me over it.
[940.55] that's why you didn't
even bother telling me.
[943.09] I would definitely like to talk
to you, but not on this topic.
[948.68] And I would like to talk
on this very topic only.
[952.15] -Ain't I a part of this house?
-You are a part of this house, but...
[958.62] If I am a part
then where does this "but" come from?
[963.06] Tell me, I want to know
how Shabana feels after knowing all this?
[967.64] I haven't told Shabana about it yet.
[970.57] Great, Azmat, just great.
[973.26] You have done injustice.
[975.72] Why will I be held accountable?
And what injustice have I done to you?
[980.03] You are a Hitler when being a husband,
and Mr. generous when being a brother.
[986.04] There is a thing called moderation, Azmat.
[990.01] Let alone taunting her,
you haven't even told Shabana yet.
[994.69] I don't get one thing,
[997.12] Why do you wish bad for Shabana?
[999.64] Why would I wish bad for her? Her
daughter is enough to do bad for her.
[1005.55] What do you want then?
[1007.40] I just want to prove, Azmat,
[1009.81] that your principles for your sister
are something else than for us.
[1014.40] Where did the equality go which you
keep  properating, round the clock?
[1018.77] If this is what you think
then you are mistaken.
[1021.93] My principles are similar for everyone.
[1024.40] I am going to tell Shabana,
but at the right time.
[1028.45] And when will
those beautiful moments arrive?
[1030.95] My sister is a heart patient.
[1033.19] I don't want her to tell anything right now
which can be fatal for her.
[1042.75] I think you know it very well,
you aren't that stupid,
[1048.38] what I am trying to say.
[1050.29] Do you get it?
[1051.81] Yes, sure, Azmat.
I am the dumbest in this house.
[1056.14] -Anyway...
-That is enough for me.
[1059.18] You know it well. And I
know it well too that
[1062.11] you guys are taking
advantage of my weak point.
[1065.04] But I won't get irritated
no matter how much you try.
[1068.81] If you can get me a cup
of tea then bring it,
[1071.66] or else just switch
 the light off and leave.
[1095.76] Zoya said you wanted to talk to me?
[1100.41] You know very well
what I want to talk to you about.
[1103.87] No, not at all. Why would I know?
[1105.65] My thinking is very different now from that
of you two. So, I don't have any idea.
[1110.34] You can at least
look towards me while talking.
[1117.94] Go ahead.
[1120.65] Zaid, please don't do this to me.
[1124.18] I shouldn't do? What can I do, Aima,
you have done it all to yourself.
[1129.56] Please, forgive me.
[1137.62] Remember you said
that silence is partial agreement.
[1143.62] Yes, but this time it doesn't mean that.
[1149.28] Please, I don't feel like talking to you.
[1153.21] Zaid, you don't like me anymore
because of such a petty issue?
[1158.06] Petty issue?
[1160.88] This might be a petty issue
for you, but not for me.
[1163.51] You know what, Aima, don't hurt me any
more by talking like this, just leave.
[1166.55] Fine, I'll leave.
[1173.70] But remember one thing,
[1177.31] Today, when I need you
the most, are aren't with me.
[1185.94] No one is going to believe me.
[1189.98] And you know my character well,
don't you, Zaid?
[1194.89] Yes I was aware of your character,
[1196.86] but here I can't support you because
I am not aware of anything.
[1202.25] You called him yourself.
You went to meet him at his flat as well.
[1205.81] For all I know, you might be having
an affair with him too.
[1216.21] Listen, I'm sorry, I got carried away.
I didn't mean to...
[1220.08] Okay, sorry, please. Sit down, sit.
[1222.19] I didn't mean to say that.
[1228.28] Why do you do it?
[1234.38] I know it's my fault.
[1237.79] My character has become 
questionable because of my mistake.
[1243.10] Are you insane?
Nothing of this sort is going to happen.
[1246.86] You know even if an angel 
testifies against your character,
[1251.00] then I won't believe him.
[1255.46] Listen, don't worry. I'm here for you.
Everything is going to be fine.
[1259.53] Just give me his number 
I will get all the information.
[1265.22] Thank you. Thank you so
much for trusting me.
[1270.13] Or else, I couldn't have
trusted myself either.
[1274.78] Stop talking like a fool,
[1276.70] and listen, stop this habit 
of crying over every petty issue.
[1284.47] Keep smiling.
[1287.75] Aima has gotten into wrong things.
[1290.85] And that guy, he is blackmailing now.
[1297.07] Why did I become unwanted
[1301.67] Nobody knows that
[1306.40] Why did I become unwanted
[1310.83] Nobody knows that
[1384.73] -Dear...
-Wow, what a surprise?!
[1391.28] What is it? Did I disturb you?
[1396.33] No one can disturb me so easily.
[1399.68] By the way, why have you come?
[1403.72] I can't find brother, where has he gone?
[1407.45] Dad is in a lot of stress, but he has
gone out for some work right now.
[1413.80] But don't you worry,
[1417.10] he will get your medicines.
[1420.08] Did you want to talk 
to him about something?
[1423.03] Yes, I wanted to talk to him.
[1428.92] But is everything all right? 
Why is brother in stress?
[1436.17] -Don't you know?
-No.
[1440.55] If dad hasn't told you then there
must be some reason behind it.
[1449.96] Look, I am really worried after
knowing that brother is in stress.
[1458.60] Tell me what is it? Why is he in stress?
[1465.27] Okay, but don't tell dad 
that I have told this to you.
[1474.49] I remembered something 
after looking at you.
[1480.20] -Won't you ask me what it is?
-What is it?
[1482.97] Only the flower's unaware
Rest of the garden knows
[1492.43] Be strong while listening to it.
[1495.73] Aima has been caught red-handed
in a guy's house.
[1506.36] -What?
-Yes.
[1508.84] Everybody has the got photos too.
[1512.01] And that guy, he has been threatening dad.
[1523.51] Aima?
[1527.62] My? My Aima?
[1531.43] Yes, Aima. Your Aima.
[1536.92] Anyway, that rascal has even said that
he is going to put Aima's pictures
[1542.25]  on a shady website.
[1544.99] Only God can save Aima now.
[1550.34] What is going to happen to her now, auntie.
[1552.95] Aima has gotten into such bad things.
[1556.02] And that guy, he is blackmailing now.
[1563.49] Poor dad,
[1565.80] it's so sad, he was so proud of Aima...
[1577.07] Auntie... auntie!
[1580.20] Auntie? Go ask the driver 
to get the card ready, hurry up!
[1582.93] Auntie, auntie... auntie!
[1587.20] Hurry up, driver.
Get the car ready! Auntie!
[1605.37] -Dad, have some water at least.
-No, I don't want water.
[1611.69] You guys are here since long. 
Aima, at least you have some water.
[1616.12] I don't want to drink water, Zaid.
[1618.34] Mother is inside since so long,
doctors haven't told anything yet.
[1623.58] Look, Aima, it's a heart related issue.
It's going to take time examining it.
[1627.90] Please don't worry, hope the best from
God, everything is going to be fine.
[1631.74] I a really worried, Zaid.
[1635.17] I can understand,
[1637.42] but please pray for her I am also praying.
Everything is going to be okay.
[1645.01] Dad, you have been standing 
for so long, please sit down.
[1648.75] I'm fine, you sit down.
[1650.70] Dad, please sit down for a while.
[1661.18] Zaid...
[1664.70] I can't stand seeing him angry with me.
[1668.46] Be strong, Aima.
[1670.56] Once auntie gets back home after getting
well, everything is going to be fine.
[1675.74] Don't worry, I'm here.
[1679.54] You... have some water, have it. 
No, just have it.
[1699.73] Nosheen, where did you get 
your mobile from?
[1705.58] -I knew it since long where it was hidden.
-And where was it?
[1710.84] In Dad's drawer.
[1714.05] I just couldn't get a chance 
to get it out from there.
[1717.27] When I got a chance, I got it.
[1721.09] And what if he finds out?
[1723.98] And who is going to tell you? You?
[1729.53] No, I am not going to tell him.
[1732.41] How would he know then?
[1734.51] -All he has on mind now is auntie's health.
-That's true.
[1739.06] Haven't heard of him for quite some time.
[1742.42] Why?  Didn't you talk him over the phone?
[1744.89] I did but he didn't tell me 
anything as such.
[1750.40] Well, had it been something big, 
we would have know it by now.
[1754.96] This means it's nothing serious.
[1757.84] I think, there is 
Shabana's conspiracy behind it.
[1762.98] She has planned it all thoughtfully.
[1765.85] You mean, was she pretending 
to have a heart attack?
[1768.85] It seems like a new deceit
created by Shabana.
[1774.39] So that she can gain
Azmat's sympathies again,
[1777.42] and Aima's topic is closed forever.
[1781.71] Yes, Mama, you are right.
[1784.41] Now, look, what sort of
pain is it
[1786.02] that comes when one wants to,
and goes when one wants.
[1789.40] Aunties was perfectly fine till the evening, 
and suddenly she got heart pain?
[1795.13] I told you. They both are very cunning.
[1798.76] They will not give up so easily.
[1802.51] Anyway, don't get worried, 
the ball is still in our court.
[1807.96] It's too late now, just go and sleep.
[1810.59] Nosheen, you too. Okay?
[1879.07] Zaid, please go and find out. 
Doctor's haven't told us anything yet.
[1884.38] Aima, I just went and asked.
[1886.12] They are saying they have
to do some urgent tests,
[1887.90] and they are going to tell
the situation after that.
[1891.02] It's all because of me.
[1894.14] I have made a lot of blunders.
[1898.52] I hurt you by not telling you.
[1902.14] I troubled mother, lost dad's trust.
[1906.52] Mother is worried because of me.
[1908.16] It's not your fault, Aima. 
Why are you saying that?
[1911.54] It is like that, Zaid.
[1913.73] Mother wasn't aware of what is going on,
but she was still worried.
[1917.69] Did she say something to you?
[1920.65] She didn't say anything in front of me,
[1923.35] but internally she was worried about me.
[1927.44] She must have taken stress about it.
[1930.81] Zaid, if something happens to her because
of me, I could never forgive myself.
[1936.01] Please, don't talk like that.
[1939.07] Look, dad's here.
[1941.30] -Did the doctor tell anything?
-Not yet, Dad. I asked them.
[1945.39] They are doing some tests 
and given her few injections.
[1962.16] -Zoya?
-Mom, Auntie Shabana has got a heart attack,
[1965.46] Zaid just called me, he was saying 
Aima's condition is well at all.
[1970.43] I'm going to the hospital.
[1972.45] Okay, so where are you going at this hour?
[1976.95] Mom, she is my friend's mother.
[1981.75] Look, her condition isn't that serious
right now that you must go to the hospital.
[1987.29] How do you know?
[1989.52] -Your aunt told me.
-And you didn't bother to tell it to me?
[1993.98] I didn't tell you intentionally,
[1996.88] that you might get disturbed
and stay worried all night.
[2000.23] So am I not getting disturbed now?
[2002.18] Okay, just don't get angry, come here. 
Come, sit down.
[2007.84] Mom, you should come 
to the hospital with me.
[2012.26] What are we going to do there?
[2014.38] What are you talking about? 
Why do people visit the hospital?
[2018.02] She is in the emergency room right now.
[2020.27] You know it well that they don't let
many people stay in the emergency room.
[2026.52] Brother Azmat, Zaid and Aima,
everyone is already there.
[2032.26] And you know how your uncles is.
[2034.68] If he says anything to you,
I won't like it at all.
[2039.09] But, Mom, I think she would need me.
[2042.97] Fine, call her right now, 
and you can go later.
[2048.49] Okay, fine.
[2060.11] Why did I get unwanted
[2064.74] Nobody knows that
[2069.36] Why did I get unwanted
[2073.96] Nobody knows that.
[2079.19] -What is wrong with mother?
-She has had a major heart attack.
[2082.38] We will have to do her angiography, so that
we can know how many arteries are blocked.
[2087.88] Major heart attack?
[2090.25] -He likes a girl called Kinza.
-Really?
[2093.61] My would-be sister-in-law's name is Kinza?
[2096.54] Doctor has told Shabana not to talk much.
[2099.41] May that's why Aima said this to you.
[2102.72] I didn't go to chat either,
it was all the usual.
[2106.11] What happened, when it happened
and how it happened, that's it.
[2109.75] Kids want to do everything 
according to their own wish.
[2114.06] They want to make the decisions about
their own lives with full right as well.
[2119.95] It is like that, Dad.
