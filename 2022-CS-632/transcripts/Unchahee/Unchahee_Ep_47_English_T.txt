[1542.00] he is saying that he wants to go somewhere,
[1545.65] I just went to my mother's house, there is no
[1548.49] money, five, now see, he did not agree, with how much
[1553.21] love I was going to go somewhere, I am in a
[1558.14] nursing home, I know very well that my
[1560.49] refusal means refusal,
[1565.81] a political map, a very stubborn man, if
[1568.81] anyone sets any work in front of me, then
[1570.85] I do not let it happen at all, so why ca
[1572.52] n't we go for a trip,
[1576.39] because I am not in a habit of signing
[1578.71] with you like this, that
[1580.49] I do not want to go with you at all,
[1583.36] number-5 I do not love a spoon, now you are in love,
[1593.15] [Music]
[1594.82] and in love, a person has to go somewhere  I had to sacrifice
[1596.77] and how many sacrifices did you make that a
[1604.87] person bows his head in love so I am
[1608.23] here, did you ever do such a thing
[1611.14] [Sangeet]
[1615.19] that I did not know what all extra things in my emotions,
[1620.21] hmm, I am thinking whether my
[1621.86] decision to marry you was right or
[1623.99] not,
[1627.20] then because you are asking me to marry you,
[1632.08] show more that
[1633.75] you know very well that you
[1635.64] trapped me, in fact you blackmailed me, it is
[1639.24] better that I do not make you open my mouth, but it will become
[1640.74] difficult for you to stay in the house
[1643.05] and yes,
[1645.78] now there will be no talk related to honeymoon in this house,
[1648.51] understand, you
[1660.49] tell Ajay [Sangeet]
