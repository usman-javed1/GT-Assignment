[0.22] From flowers and from buds
[4.78] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.45] When I saw you
[14.41] I learned how to chirp from you
[18.94] Sister, whatever Nosheen
has done, it's her mistake.
[24.75] If I am trying to get her
back to this house,
[27.39] it's because I want the environment
of this house get better.
[31.23] I know everything.
[32.72] There must be some hidden interest
of yours to bring Nosheen back home.
[35.89] You are doing all this
to look good in front of Azmat.
[39.83] I know everything.
[45.03] I love you, Zoya.
[47.85] I love you too, Zaid.
[59.75] You must be having so much fun
[61.76] by looking at all this situation.
[64.93] You must be enjoying a lot.
[68.35] Go ahead, enjoy.
[69.73] But I'm going to snatch all this happiness
away from you real soon.
[79.31] Amber, I can't find peace
even for a single moment.
[82.60] Not even at my home.
[83.86] I just feel less burdened
when I come to you.
[88.46] You should come then,
whenever you feel like.
[91.74] Why are you so worried?
Nosheen is back home too.
[95.54] I am really distressed because of Nosheen.
[100.69] Why? Has she done something again?
[104.18] But it bothers me how
she stays home all the time.
[108.94] No education, nothing to do,
nor she can go anywhere.
[112.47] Nobody talks to her at home, and I
keep scolding her all the time as well.
[118.07] Then don't scold her.
She did a mistake and paid for it.
[122.94] She has learned her lesson not
to attempt such a thing ever in life.
[129.16] But what is going to happen next, Amber?
[131.58] I don't see any signs
of a suitable proposal for her too.
[135.90] Why are you getting so disappointed?
It's not even her age to get married.
[140.73] Yes, you are right.
[142.68] Why don't you let her continue her studies?
[146.63] Let her take a good course. It would
be as better for you both as busy she gets.
[151.76] You are 100% right, Amber.
[154.11] But when the head of the family
has lost interest in his own daughter
[157.86]  then what course and what studies?
[161.01] At least talk to brother Azmat, he
considers education very important.
[166.12] All his focus is on Aima.
[168.55] Here she gets done with her studies
[169.91] and he has already offered her
a job in his company.
[175.87] These mother-daughter have
already ripped a lot of money from us
[177.88] and now this monthly salary too.
[181.13] I don't understand, what
was the need of all this?
[186.19] If she is done with her education,
[188.48] he should look for a good
match for her and get her married.
[191.56] Even I don't get it.
[193.82] Her mother is so content as if she doesn't
have to get her daughter married ever.
[198.60] Or maybe her daughter is one in a million
[201.26] that she will be getting
proposals even if she reaches 30.
[203.61] That's a very dangerous apprehension.
[205.65] By the way, nobody hires their relatives.
[209.57] You never know when
and where they deceive you,
[213.81] because they are trusted so much.
[216.34] What if she takes over the office?
[218.65] I can never trust anyone
when it come to my business.
[223.88] They are going to embezzle
everything that belongs to us
[225.80] and we will just keep looking, Amber.
[228.87] She doesn't seem like that though.
[232.70] But I don't get it
[235.46] why he doesn't care about his own
daughter and gives favors to others.
[239.64] That's the biggest
sorrow of my life, Amber,
[242.76] that instead of his
children and wife,
[246.27] Azmat is worried about his
sister and niece all the time.
[250.33] But don't surrender in front
of brother Azmat so easily.
[255.23] Either get Aima out of that office,
or send Nosheen with her as well.
[260.89] You are right.
[263.29] But brother Azmat doesn't seem like that.
[267.57] The things you tell about him,
he has never done such things before.
[273.44] He wasn't like that before,
[274.64] but gradually the love for his
sister and niece is increasing.
[280.44] But still, Nosheen did what she did,
[284.98] he can't deprive her of her rights.
[304.72] Take this upstairs.
[317.17] I'm surprised, you're early today.
[319.77] Yes, as the days that our children
will join our company are approaching
[323.73] I have started to work less.
[326.76] -Do you plan to retire?
-No, no.
[329.96] I will retire the day
my heart stops working.
[335.12] Please don't say things like that.
[338.11] You can be happy,
I won't get retired and stay at home.
[342.62] To stay busy in life, to keep
achieving one or the other goal,
[347.34] that's my principle, you know that.
[350.36] Teach your children
these golden rules as well.
[353.94] I am teaching them.
Everything will be done gradually.
[358.59] There have been a lot of
changes in Zaid in past few months.
[363.47] You have a child other
than Zaid in this house.
[368.81] Now that you have let her back home,
why don't you please forgive her as well?
[373.42] Why do you bring her up every time?
[375.64] I have let her back home,
isn't that enough?
[377.70] You have let her back in the house only.
[380.44] If you'll forgive her, things
will get back to normal.
[385.75] Look, whatever has happened,
we are responsible for that too.
[391.55] Not we, you.
[395.44] Just you and your fault.
[398.69] You have brought her up, not me.
[401.53] This is something you always do,
hide behind the obligations of your work.
[407.40] A father has a role too
in bringing up children.
[412.68] And what do I know where you
went using work as an excuse.
[419.93] Don't cross you limit, okay?
[424.27] I knew it that you can't display
good behaviour for much long.
[429.10] All right, I'm sorry.
[433.42] Listen, I need to talk
to you about Nosheen.
[438.65] I think you are forgetting that you
are going to agree with all my decisions.
[450.00] I remember my words, but I'm worried.
[451.62] What is it that you want?
[452.86] I want that you take Nosheen
with you to work like Aima.
[462.20] -That isn't possible.
-Why not?
[466.07] You said that Nosheen and
Aima both are like your children.
[471.47] Isn't it contradicting that one will go to
work and the other is going to stay home?
[476.27] There was a time like that, that's true,
[478.19] but now I openly declare
that I differentiate between her and Aima.
[484.15] Aima is like my daughter, while you
daughter is no where near her, got  it?
[489.00] You are depriving her of her rights.
[490.95] You are being cruel to Nosheen.
[495.26] Now matter how much you say
it, Aima can never be your child,
[500.33] and no matter how much you try,
Nosheen is going to remain your daughter.
[506.90] Please, please don't be so cruel.
[510.75] All right, let's assume. Even if I take
her to the office, what is she going to do?
[516.98] Any petty work,
the point is to keep her busy.
[520.25] I know very well what your
and your daughter's point is,
[523.09] you just want to send her to office to
copy Aima, there is no other reason.
[528.12] The thing is that your daughter
is not able to do anything.
[531.52] She can't even do
data entry in computer.
[533.84] Shall I take her to my office
to get myself mocked?
[536.61] Have you ever thought how
much you hurt her by doing all this?
[542.74] What if she does something wrong?
[544.40] Is there anything wrong left
that she could do?
[548.20] I mean to say that...
[551.35] what if she tries to take her life?
What are you going to do then?
[554.95] I am going to do what I have
been doing since past few days.
[561.63] One who loses respect in my eyes,
[564.91] it doesn't matter if he lives or dies.
[587.07] Nothing is going on.
I have lost the life I had left myself.
[593.78] I miss college so much.
[595.83] I wish I hadn't gotten trapped
by that scoundrel.
[599.50] My life would have been peaceful at least.
[603.63] Don't know where he is being a disgrace.
Who is he spending my money on.
[608.80] I pray to God everyday,
[611.19] may he get a painful death,
may the scumbag die while suffering.
[617.72] Okay, go then.
[620.33] Listen, call me some time,
I feel good when you do.
[625.97] Okay, bye.
[637.09] Hello, greetings, auntie.
[640.38] How are you doing? I'm fine.
[644.51] Auntie, I called to ask if you
checked with your contacts.
[653.05] What?
[655.52] There isn't anyone who
can find out about Faisal?
[663.71] Okay, bye.
[669.89] Everybody is just useless. I asked
one thing and even that can't be done.
[676.64] You have no idea how
happy I am after knowing this.
[680.12] I thought you would waste few
more years of your life by delaying it.
[684.87] I told you, mom, the day I find
a good guy I'm going to say yes.
[690.24] By the way, what are you further plans?
[693.87] I'll call Mrs. Rashid.
We all should meet once,
[698.56] We can discuss our
further plans after that.
[702.30] Sounds good. Ask them to
come this coming weekend.
[706.56] All right, I'll inform them.
[715.39] And yes, listen, I am not going
to do anything stupid.
[718.31] Neither am I going to serve them tea,
nor I am going to be shy in front of them.
[722.90] And I am going to talk as much as I want.
[725.17] And where I feel like I shouldn't talk,
I will go quiet there.
[729.72] Besides, I have already met Daniyal.
[732.64] Just want to judge his parents now.
[735.83] Don't you worry dear, they are
quiet progressive people themselves.
[740.14] I know Mrs. Rashid since long.
[744.48] But, tell me one thing,
[749.59] Doesn't Aima have any plans to get married?
[755.41] I don't think so.
[756.94] Aima wants to work with uncle and then MBA.
[762.02] So, I don't think she has any
plans of getting married right now.
[767.23] I think she should get married.
[769.42] Mom, everybody has
their own mindset.
[773.04] And one should do
what he is comfortable with.
[777.65] Besides, Aima is too simple.
[781.14] Wherever uncle and her
mom would ask her to marry,
[784.53] she would abide them
without saying anything.
[789.17] I think she should be thankful for whatever
proposal she is getting and say yes to it.
[794.78] Mom, what do you mean by that?
[797.08] Do you think she can't get good proposals?
[799.97] No, I mean...
[804.26] See, she respects her mother
and brother Azmat so much.
[810.38] I just wanted that she gets
married in front of them.
[816.21] She can work and do her MBA
even after she gets married.
[819.27] Mom, since when have you started
thinking like those old school aunties?
[823.92] Besides, I can't discuss
such boring topics.
[828.67] Forget it.
[829.90] Tell me one thing.
[833.38] I hope you aren't getting married
under any pressure or something?
[838.26] I don't want to pressurize you in any way.
[841.48] You can take
all the time you need to think.
[845.09] Mom, when I was delaying
then you were in a hurry,
[850.32] And now that I'm ready...
Why are you afraid?
[853.87] Dear, the most difficult time for
a mother is to fix her marriage.
[860.29] And I think I am anxious about that only.
[863.05] Mom, I am confident about
Daniyal, and I really like him.
[869.44] And when the marriage
is fixed then why not him.
[874.15] I think he is the best option.
[876.96] Thank God.
[878.86] I am relieved that you aren't getting
married because I pressurized you.
[883.17] Mom, If I were under pressure I wouldn't
have rejected 400 other boys before this.
[890.51] Right! let me call them.
[905.83] Mom, what is it?
Did you want anything?
[908.49] Can't I sit with my son without
wanting anything from him?
[912.58] Of course you can.
[915.77] Tell me, how is you exam preparation going?
[920.90] What kind of a question is this?
I'm not in school any more.
[924.05] Okay, then talk about something else.
[927.80] Like what?
[929.75] That friend of your, Kinza,
what's up with her?
[936.66] She is just a friend,
what's wrong with you?
[938.78] It's okay, I'm your mother, tell me.
[943.25] Yes, our friendship just ended.
[946.50] -But why?
-No specific reason, it just ended.
[950.72] Zaid, I have felt since past few days
[953.26] that you have been trying
to avoid me. Are you angry?
[959.21] No, it's nothing like that.
I was just a bit busy.
[962.81] Are you sure you aren't angry?
[966.41] Look, Zaid,
[968.20] everyone is effected with whatever has been
going on since past few days in this house.
[974.29] And obviously Nosheen is
the most effected one with all of it.
[982.41] She is broken from inside, Zaid.
[984.87] You can't even imagine.
[988.35] Zaid, I know that you're angry with me,
and you don't even want to look at Nosheen.
[997.16] -I'm not angry with you.
-And what about Nosheen?
[1001.68] I've forgiven her.
[1002.74] The way you said it shows that
you haven't truly forgiven her.
[1009.40] Mom, it doesn't even matter, honestly.
[1011.32] Whether I forgive Nosheen or not, if it
doesn't make any difference to her then...
[1014.80] No, dear, she...
[1016.03] Mom, if that's what you want to talk about
then please, I have better things to do.
[1019.84] Because of this attitude of yours,
our family is suffering the most,
[1025.13] that no one from outside, be it anyone,
doesn't need to conspire against us.
[1031.91] We have become so hollow from within.
[1034.12] Mom, nobody is conspiring against us.
[1036.70] Nosheen has done as bad with
this family as it could have been done.
[1039.87] And honestly, I have no interest
in discussing this matter anymore.
[1066.68] Aima, dear.
[1070.01] where have you been since yesterday?
[1072.00] You just gave me my
medicine, didn't even sit with me.
[1074.92] Is everything all right?
[1076.37] Yes, mom, everything is fine.
It's just that Zaid had fever.
[1080.08] So I spent all day with him.
[1083.10] And you know how Zaid behaves
like a kid when he has got fever.
[1088.49] Yes, I too went to ask how he was.
[1092.17] I just got free with my
own stuff a while ago so...
[1095.99] I was busy earlier.
[1098.06] No problem. How is Zaid feeling now?
[1101.24] He better now.
[1109.41] What is it, mom?
You wanted to say something?
[1113.02] Yes.
[1115.92] I want to say something but
don't understand how to ask you.
[1121.16] Mom, what is it that you have to think
about so much before talking to me about it?
[1127.12] Dear, there are many things
that aren't easy to ask for.
[1134.22] May I ask what is it about?
[1137.75] Obviously it is about you, your life.
[1141.36] Whatever it is, you can
ask me without hesitation.
[1144.58] Your education is completed.
[1148.68] And now you are going
to start work in brother's office too.
[1156.57] I want you to get married while I am alive.
[1163.68] I don't understand if I should
ask this question from you or not.
[1168.53] But before I take any
decision about your life,
[1175.16] I want to ask you that
[1179.40] do you have any plan about your life?
[1186.55] What sort of plan, mom?
[1188.75] Anything that you have in
mind, that you want to do.
[1194.56] You can tell me.
[1196.76] I have no such plans, mom.
[1198.36] And I have always wanted that you and
dad take these decisions of my life for me.
[1202.93] I knew it that this is
going to be your answer.
[1207.82] Dear, is there someone you like?
[1216.12] If me and brother choose a guy for you,
would you have any objection?
[1224.17] Not at all, mom. Even I can't take a better
decision for me than you and dad can do.
[1229.54] Aima, I'm proud of you.
[1234.87] Actually, dad has chosen a boy for you.
[1242.69] Really?
[1244.53] Yes, I don't know who he is, but my heart
tells me that he has chosen Zaid for you.
[1280.32] What mother said, is that true?
[1287.74] I give up hope every time
and then get hopeful again.
[1296.82] Oh, God, if this is a dream
then please keep me sleeping.
[1305.45] Because it's more
beautiful than the reality.
[1310.87] And if it is reality then
[1314.59] please don't separate me and Zaid
even in my dreams.
[1322.52] I think about it and wonder,
[1327.41] that a person's life is
full of ups and downs,
[1332.20] highs and lows.
[1335.43] At times it seems
as if nothing is going to change.
[1340.28] and sometimes one's life is
changed in a single moment.
[1347.32] My God, it's only You who can do all this.
[1353.07] Everything is in Your hands.
[1356.41] You provide this broken, hopeless person
from a source and in such a way
[1369.18] that he hasn't even imagined
getting it in such a way.
[1372.65] Whenever Zaid starts liking a new girl
[1378.81] I always feel that he can never be mine.
[1386.67] But what did I know that You
are going to unite us this way
[1392.27] where dad is going to ask mother
my hand in marriage himself for Zaid.
[1395.70] But until this dream
becomes a complete reality,
[1402.04] I wan to stay in disbelief.
[1418.05] Nosheen, what have you
thought about your life dear?
[1423.50] What do you plan to do further?
[1426.55] What can I do, Mama?
What is left there in my life
[1429.36]  besides chilling, and I'm doing that.
[1432.43] Nosheen, my dear, you watch
movie all night, and sleep all day long.
[1438.66] This isn't life.
[1440.68] Do something, learn something new.
[1443.85] I am learning , Mama.
I watch criminal movies
[1447.04] and I'm trying to learn how
to fetch fugitive criminals.
[1451.69] Nosheen, please. All of it is useless,
my child. You're wasting your time.
[1460.98] Nosheen all of it is unachievable.
[1463.96] Whatever you have studied
is going to get rusted too.
[1468.01] -What shall I do then?
-Do some course.
[1473.68] Which course?
[1475.67] Any cooking course, or some baking course?
[1481.04] You know it, Mama, that I start feeling bad
even by listening to the name of cooking.
[1485.43] I have zero interest in it.
[1487.17] Nosheen, my child,
what are you interested in then?
[1490.97] You are zero in studies,
you don't know any work.
[1496.78] Why don't you do some cooking
or computer related course?
[1500.06] At least don't sit idle like that.
[1502.36] And what do you think?
Would dad allow me to get out of the house?
[1507.41] You just prepare yourself
and leave the rest to me.
[1513.75] Listen to me, Nosheen.
[1515.12] Look, if you take a computer
related course or a language course,
[1519.38] then I will get your studies
continued as well from next year.
[1523.27] Means I have to start studies again?
[1526.02] Stop it, Nosheen. I'm saying
this for your own betterment.
[1532.64] If you'll learn it will be
useful for you in future,
[1534.60] and education is
really important for girls, Nosheen.
[1540.16] Look, you are at ease right now because
you have your father's money to spend.
[1545.91] If something bad happens tomorrow, this
degree is going to be useful for you, Nosheen.
[1550.94] Please, take it seriously.
[1553.74] There are girls who even work along
with their studies, and here you are...
[1557.89] What is wrong with you, Mama?
[1560.28] And we will take care of
what happens tomorrow later.
[1565.52] Nosheen, please. If you won't do
anything and keep sitting idle like this,
[1570.56]  you are going to stay uneducated.
[1573.97] What is wrong, Mama? It hasn't been
even five days since I have returned home.
[1579.00] These five days will turn
to five years and you won't even realize.
[1584.97] Five years, it's a long time.
A lot of things will change.
[1590.93] Nosheen, if you mean that you will
be married withing these five years
[1597.17] then get rid of this thought.
[1601.95] Because the things going on around
you regarding your proposal and marriage,
[1608.37] I don't think that's ever
going to be possible.
[1610.96] -Even then...
-Mama,
[1613.51] you are underestimating Nosheen once again.
[1616.40] For God's sake, please,
don't do something new,
[1620.69] just try to prove that
you can get married still.
[1624.39] Whatever, please go from here now.
[1626.55] Nosheen, please
take whatever I'm saying seriously.
[1629.81] I'm saying all this for your betterment.
[1641.83] Hey, Shabana, come sit.
[1646.33] If you're busy, I can come later.
[1648.89] No, no, this keeps going on, you carry on.
[1653.47] I wanted to tell you that
the medicine that doctor changed,
[1658.19] I can't find it here.
[1660.14] I sent the driver but he said that
we can get it from the main market.
[1665.29] Oh, the driver called me to tell this.
[1668.09] And I forgot it.
[1670.49] I'll ask Zaid, he will get it right now.
[1673.76] No, brother, he will have to go so far away,
[1677.30] Besides I have to take
a tablet after every two days.
[1680.52] And I have taken one yesterday.
[1681.86] Okay then I'll get it
myself. It's in my way.
[1685.98] I'll get the medicines tomorrow.
[1688.61] Okay, brother.
[1689.66] By the way, if you need something
you should ask Zaid without hesitation.
[1693.23] Don't try to save him every time
or else he will become an idler.
[1698.02] No, brother. May God
save him from evil eye.
[1704.42] Zaid is very obedient.
He never says no to me.
[1709.66] He has become very responsible.
Exactly the way I wanted him to be.
[1718.23] Brother, I had to talk
to you, but right now...
[1721.99] Yeah, go ahead. I'm listening.
[1727.17] I don't understand how to ask you.
[1734.64] I know what you're trying to ask, Shabana.
[1739.54] You are thinking absolutely right,
I was signaling about that.
[1745.62] As soon as I get a chance,
I'll talk to him.
[1751.23] Yes, but actually I'm worried because
[1759.64] would Zaid also agree to this proposal?
[1765.64] I hope so.
[1767.32] But don't worry,
[1770.67] I don't want to impose my decisions
on my children, I hope you understand.
[1775.97] Yes, brother.
[1778.01] I have complete trust
on Zaid, he won't let me down.
[1784.14] My younger son
is not like my elder son at all.
[1787.95] So he would prefer my
happiness over his willingness.
[1794.02] -Everything is going to be fine with God's will.
-With God's will.
[1798.34] I have to finish a little work
and then we will talk, okay?
[1802.66] Okay.
[1823.49] I really love you a lot.
[1825.99] In fact, I am crazy in your love.
[1831.98] And it's good that you confessed.
[1837.04] You eased my difficulty.
[1864.82] I love you, Zoya.
[1867.58] I love you too, Zaid.
[1889.46] Aima, they are coming this
weekend and I've got nothing to wear.
[1893.28] Oh, God, Zoya, you've got
so many clothes to wear.
[1897.46] Do one thing, wear the golden one that you
wore at the welcome party at university.
[1904.31] Me wearing an old dress?
No way, I need to buy a new one.
[1908.76] My in laws are going to visit
and I'll wear an old dress?
[1917.61] Zaid's calling me, I'll talk to you later.
[1921.96] Just ignore him, he does that all the time.
Just listen to me.
[1927.30] You'll have to stay these
coming two days with me.
[1929.42] You are coming to the mall
and parlor with me, okay?
[1932.58] Don't worry about me,
I'm going to stay with you.
[1936.99] This guy is so impatient,
he is calling me now too.
[1940.00] -Wait, let me add him in the call.
-Okay.
[1946.65] Yeah, what is it, Zaid?
[1948.78] No greetings, nothing, what happened?
[1953.96] -Is Aima on call too?
-Yeah.
[1956.70] That's great.
[1958.59] Tell me why you've called?
[1960.11] Listen to me carefully.
[1963.19] I have something really
important to talk about with you two.
[1965.57] Yeah, go ahead, we are listening.
[1969.27] No, Zoya, not over the phone.
I need to talk face to face.
[1973.21] Zaid, is everything all right?
[1978.44] I don't know man,
but it's very important, it's very urgent.
[1981.92] Zaid, we were having
an important conversation right now too.
[1984.85] Zoya, the thing I want to talk about is
more important than any of your thing.
[1990.23] Really? Means even more
important than my date fixing?
[1993.37] Yes, it's even more important
than that. Very important.
[1999.04] -Is everything okay?
-Yeah, Zaid you sound strange too.
[2004.88] That's why I'm saying, we need to talk.
[2007.46] Zoya, please come quick.
-Zaid it's 9:00 pm. Why don't you come here with Aima?
[2014.14] All right, all right, I'm coming.
[2021.72] -What's up with him now?
-This guy is a pain in the head.
[2025.24] He just needs a chance to create a scene.
Attention seeker.
[2029.58] It seems something serious.
[2031.79] Do one thing, come here with him first.
[2036.43] -Okay, bye.
-Bye.
[2039.02] Good bye.
[2045.08] What's wrong with him?
