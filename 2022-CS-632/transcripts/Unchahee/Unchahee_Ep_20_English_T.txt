[0.02] From flowers and from buds
[4.57] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.16] When I saw you
[14.11] I learned how to chirp from you
[18.63] I need to go somewhere for
some work, so I'll need your car.
[22.01] Can you please ask the driver?
[25.69] This isn't possible
because I'm going with the driver.
[29.12] And mama is going to work in her car.
[31.65] Will you talk to Azmat?
[34.44] About what?
[36.07] That he takes Nosheen back in.
[39.05] He never refuses what you and Aima say.
[43.34] Nosheen.
[57.46] That girl has cheated us again, Amber.
[67.00] What happened? Did something work out?
[69.77] I couldn't talk to brother.
[72.55] But Zaid is going to talk to brother today.
[76.25] Maybe he agrees.
[79.94] Sister, look, just don't worry.
[84.34] God will make everything right.
[86.44] Everything is going to be fine gradually.
[91.10] I pray to God that He rectifies
Nosheen's future.
[95.88] -Listen.
-Yes, sister.
[98.63] Aima's studies are going
to be completed soon, right?
[100.69] Yes, she is going to have her exams soon.
[104.44] What have you planned further?
[106.23] Aren't you worried about her marriage?
[109.23] Why wouldn't I worry, sister?
[111.01] I have wish her to get married
like every other mother does.
[117.08] It's her age to get married. If not now,
when are you going to get her married?
[121.69] You're right, sister.
[123.70] -I want to, but brother...
-Why? What does he say?
[128.20] He want that Aima should join his
company after completing her studies.
[133.87] So obviously, how can I
get her married then.
[139.55] Oh, so this is what you have planned.
[144.21] I have not planned anything, sister.
[147.08] Brother wants it.
[149.87] Oh, come on,
I know very well who wants what here.
[157.98] First, you got her a good education.
[160.96] And now you'll make her work with Azmat
[163.42] so that you become
a partner in the business.
[169.70] I must admit, you've conspired so well.
[173.25] Sister, I can't even imagine
what you are thinking of.
[177.96] Come one, madam.
You imagined it and made it happen too.
[184.01] It's all my fault
that I couldn't control my husband
[187.45] like other wives do, having full control.
[192.16] Me and my daughter suffered because
of our sharp tongues.
[196.56] You and Aima won the whole game by using
your sweet talk and being a yes-person.
[202.79] Sister, this must be a game for you.
[208.50] But for me, my brother is important
[212.32] my daughter, and the peace of this house.
[215.51] I know it very well that you have
gotten me and Nosheen out of your way.
[219.99] In fact you can say
that you have ruined Nosheen.
[223.68] Sister, whatever Nosheen
has done, it's her mistake.
[229.49] If I'm trying to bring her back
[232.25] then the reason behind it is
to restore the peace of this house.
[236.01] I'm aware of everything.
[237.45] There must be some hidden interest of
yours in bringing Nosheen back home.
[240.69] You're doing all this
to look good in front of Azmat.
[244.58] I know everything.
[258.39] -How did your audition go?
-Very well.
[261.77] Can anybody reject me, huh?
[264.16] Wow, what a pleasent surprise.
[270.09] I wish I had asked for something else.
[272.44] Don't tell me that you wish
for me in your prayers.
[278.76] It hasn't come to that point yet.
[281.43] There are a lot
of other things to pray for.
[284.55] You should say that you are afraid
of asking for me in your prayers.
[288.02] Because I'm out of your league.
[291.08] Zoya, how do you develop
so many vain hopes?
[296.59] Must be really difficult, right?
[298.27] Please, stop fighting both of you.
[300.96] We aren't fighting.
[302.60] Then is this called
expressing love with each other?
[307.82] You got it, Aima.
[310.05] Actually, the love between
me and Zoya is like that.
[313.50] Isn't it so, Zoya?
[315.12] I knew it. After all
you spilled out the truth.
[320.95] What could I do?
I couldn't wait any longer.
[325.01] Okay fine, if you have fallen
in love with me then I don't mind.
[331.64] Please, Zoya. It's time that you confess
how much you love me.
[342.64] Actually, you're right, Zaid.
[348.33] I really love you a lot.
[350.89] In fact, I am crazy in your love.
[356.93] And it's good that you confessed.
[361.92] You eased my difficulty.
[376.16] I love you, Zoya.
[378.94] I love you too, Zaid.
[395.37] I'm getting suffocated.
[396.55] -I canâ€™t breathe.
-Okay, let''s end this drama right here.
[398.55] -I can't digest it anymore.
-I can't do it.
[402.68] Don't act over smart.
[406.92] Aima, all good?
[409.76] -Aima, Aima.
-Aima! What's up with her?
[415.80] Aima!
[419.15] What's wrong?
[423.72] Aima.
[429.92] Auntie. Auntie, I'm sorry.
[434.91] It's okay.
[436.86] Auntie, I'm really ashamed.
[440.01] I didn't imagine that I am going to
misbehave so much with you guys.
[445.24] I didn't imagine a lot of things either.
But they happened.
[450.81] Auntie, please forgive me.
[455.47] Auntie, I was compelled to do so.
[458.64] And you can see,
I have always been oppressed.
[462.62] Nobody has time for me in my family.
[465.34] Dad is always busy with office work,
mama in her own stuff.
[469.46] And brother Zaid,
he is with either Aima or Zoya.
[475.06] What are you trying to say?
[477.21] Just that, that I was compelled.
[479.89] And I had no other option , auntie.
[486.26] I couldn't have gotten married
to that old man.
[489.78] Imagine yourself in my place for once.
[495.52] I know, Nosheen,
you were under a lot of pressure.
[499.43] But some boundaries
aren't supposed to be crossed.
[502.57] I know, auntie, I've realized it now.
[505.82] If you had realized, you wouldn't have
insulted me and sister like that.
[511.55] Auntie, I want to change everything now.
[515.99] In fact, I want to change myself. I don't
want to be the same Nosheen anymore.
[520.76] I hope what you're saying is true.
[523.76] But to change things,
I am going to need your help.
[531.88] Look, Nosheen, I'm not going to be a part
of anything stupid with you.
[537.14] No aunty, just listen to me first.
[541.42] What do you want to say?
[551.43] I'm really very sorry.
Don't know what had happened to me.
[555.25] We don't need your sorry.
Tell us the reason.
[558.94] Yes, Aima, tell me honestly
why you were crying?
[565.40] I really have no idea what happened to me.
[568.99] What a stupid excuse.
[570.34] I mean we were having fun
and you started crying in between.
[574.22] Look, you can share with us.
[579.81] No way, she is not going to tell.
[584.96] She is doing it to you for the first
time, but she keeps doing this to me.
[587.45] Don't know what she is hiding.
[589.01] -Zaid I'm not hiding anything.
-Yes your are, and we can see that.
[594.79] Tell us.
[599.17] I don't know what is happening
to me these days.
[604.95] I start crying on petty issues.
[607.78] And I don't even know the reason.
[612.89] This is so lame, Aima.
[615.63] There is something for sure,
but you aren't telling.
[620.14] Okay, look here.
[623.12] -Are you in love with Zaid...
-No, no.
[627.92] No, no.
[629.85] It's nothing like that.
[632.02] Then?
[635.09] Actually I just started crying by thinking
how much we all three love each other.
[644.46] We three can't stay without each other
[647.05] but we have to be apart
from each other someday.
[651.97] Oh, God!
[654.28] I don't know where does this girl
get these ideas from?
[659.75] We all will remain always together.
[662.79] -Nothing is going to happen.
-Yes, ma'am, we're together.
[667.05] Now please don't start crying again.
[678.38] Whatever you want
to do further, it's up to you.
[680.73] If you want to help her then go ahead.
[683.36] You are right, it's a risk.
[686.47] I will have to get involved
in the police investigation and all.
[689.75] Thank God, Mom. Finally you understood
what I was trying to explain you.
[696.42] Why did I become unwanted?
[700.98] Nobody knows that.
[705.68] Why did I become unwanted?
[710.27] Nobody knows that.
[717.69] How long will this continue, Azmat?
[722.67] Let me rest, Almas.
[725.76] I wish God gave ma a heart like yours too.
[729.96] It doesn't matter to you
if I talk to you or not,
[736.14] our children stay in this hour or not.
[741.98] People find peace in looking
at their children but here...
[754.58] You're right.
[760.91] I had thought the same.
[764.25] That one find peace
in looking at their children.
[767.69] I couldn't find peace in their presence.
May be I can find some in their absence.
[774.84] If not yourself then
at least think about me, Azmat.
[780.31] Call Nosheen back for the sake
of my peace, please.
[785.94] Hammad's sorrow wasn't less as is.
[789.73] And you threw out Nosheen as well.
[792.55] I threw her out?
[794.59] Are you in your senses?
[797.72] I think you have no idea what
that girl has done to us.
[801.26] I know it.
[803.05] Don't embarrass me
by repeating it again and again.
[807.69] No, not at all. You have no idea.
[811.76] If you did, you would have
taught her a lesson this time.
[815.62] I have scolded her a lot, Azmat.
[819.90] She has not only ruined our honor,
[823.75] but she has lost
my valuable diamond sets too.
[827.93] If I hadn't told her where the sets are
[830.97] the fraudster wouldn't have
run off with them.
[833.74] That doesn't end here, Almas.
[837.36] I had opened her account.
[839.73] I had deposited 5 million rupees
in it as a wedding gift.
[844.35] What? Then?
[847.49] Well,
[850.01] that account is empty now.
[852.70] What sins are we being punished for?
[856.89] The amount of money she lost,
[860.73] how may poor girls
would have gotten married in that amount.
[864.43] What has happened to us?
We have been robbed just like that.
[868.17] -We're ruined.
-Nothing has happened.
[872.35] Thank God he has given us so much
that I am not worried about losing money.
[879.39] But...
[882.70] our daughter's character
which has been stained,
[890.12] I am hurt because of that.
[893.57] The girl for whom you are shedding tears,
[896.99] she has not just defrauded you
[901.62] she has humiliated us as well.
[906.31] Humiliated us.
[908.05] I'm not crying because of Nosheen, Azmat.
[910.63] I am crying because of regret.
[913.83] You were right at every instance,
and I was wrong every time.
[918.43] You even told me to be vigilant
over that girl but I made a mistake.
[925.76] You are right. You were right
at every instance and I was wrong.
[929.98] Whatever you're going to ask me
from now on I am going to accept it.
[934.27] Just forgive me.
[936.75] I like it.
[939.10] At least you regret your mistakes.
[954.65] Are you crying?
[962.05] I am allowing you
to bring your daughter back.
[965.55] Really?
[967.21] Have you actually forgiven her?
[971.87] I don't have words to thank you, Azmat.
[975.56] -I haven't forgiven her.
-Then?
[979.47] I have allowed her to come back home only.
[983.57] Make it clear to her as well that
she is just going to be back home,
[990.48] not in my heart.
[994.29] She can't get a place in my heart again.
[999.82] She just can't.
[1010.30] Oh, God, why do these kids grow up?
[1022.68] What favor?
[1026.20] She was asking me
if I had some powerful connections.
[1031.26] What for?
[1033.92] She wants to find about that guy
who ditched her.
[1039.56] And she ran off to elope.
[1042.83] but the guy ran off alone,
along with all the gift money.
[1048.20] Poor girl.
[1050.00] Zoya, behave.
[1053.42] Sorry, Mom. Carry on.
[1055.60] Nosheen wanted to get 
some information about that guy.
[1060.96] I was thinking to take her 
to meet Bisharat.
[1066.11] -Bisharat?
-My lawyer.
[1069.94] He is a very smart guy.
[1072.11] He has got many links too.
I think he can help her out.
[1077.19] Mo, please stay away from her. Don't know
what new problem she is going to create.
[1083.50] No, she wants to change now.
[1087.03] Really? Is she changed?
[1090.42] You know very well what she has done.
[1095.45] I donâ€™t know how you can
trust her. At least I canâ€™t.
[1099.92] I'm doing all this 
just because of my sister.
[1102.95] She'll be happy 
if she gets her jewelry back.
[1106.22] Mom, in such cases 
you don't get anything back.
[1111.25] Instead one has to pay 
even more from his own pocket. Then what?
[1115.67] If you'll listen to me,
I'd say, do her a favor
[1118.17]  and just send her back from this home.
[1121.09] At least cooperate 
with me just a little bit.
[1123.55] I can't say to my sister 
to just come and take her away.
[1128.38] Mom, I have tried to explain you 
as much as I could.
[1133.87] It's up to you whatever you want to do.
[1136.05] If you want to help her then go ahead.
[1138.67] You're right in a way. It is risky.
[1141.87] I'll have to get involved 
in police investigation and all.
[1145.07] Thank God, Mom. Finally you have understood
what I was trying to explain you.
[1188.59] Actually, you're right, Zaid.
[1194.29] I really love you a lot.
[1196.84] In fact, I am crazy in your love.
[1202.83] And it's good that you confessed.
[1207.91] You eased my difficulty.
[1274.76] I am not interested too look at you either.
[1278.66] Tell me, that fraudster, 
did you find out anything about him?
[1282.82] I don't know how, but I want each 
and every penny back from him.
[1286.70] Why did I become unwanted
[1291.29] Nobody knows that
[1295.95] Why did I become unwanted
[1300.57] Nobody knows that
[1312.91] Listen, I was thinking 
that Nosheen's room...
[1315.90] The tea is really good, Aima.
[1319.34] Zaid, do you know Mr. Jaffery?
[1322.61] Jaffery? Are you talking 
about the one who is a trainer?
[1326.43] Yes, the same.
[1327.78] I met him today.
[1330.55] I found a very old link 
to connect with him.
[1333.06] I have talked to him regarding you.
[1335.06] Regarding what?
[1336.39] Just meet him 
and have a detailed discussion.
[1339.51] Share your future plans with him.
[1341.68] He'll guide you well.
[1343.85] That's great, Dad. In fact I'll also
ask him something about my studies.
[1348.29] Aima, how about your exams?
[1351.16] Yes, Dad, going great.
[1353.37] I have prepared all my presentations.
[1355.53] And now just exams are remaining.
[1357.38] They'll be over by this month.
[1359.84] Very good. You can join the office 
soon after that.
[1363.52] Whenever you say.
[1364.73] It's just that 
I have reminded you about it,
[1368.02] so that you don't join any other company.
[1371.88] Actually what happens is that
whenever a brilliant boy or girl passes out
[1377.21] different organizations 
pick them up right away.
[1380.20] Dad just don't praise her so much, she
is going to ask for an exorbitant salary.
[1385.38] I'm going to pay her as much as she wants.
[1388.01] She is everything.
[1389.99] And when you guys are going 
to join the company, you'll be relaxed.
[1399.73] Who is it at this hour?
[1402.28] -I'll just go check.
-No, sit down, Durrani will see.
[1405.71] Durani! Just see who is here at this hour?
[1410.57] So, Dad,
[1413.12] What department 
will Aima join at the office?
[1416.79] For now, you both are going 
to get some training for 3-4 months.
[1420.76] There are different positions 
in the department
[1423.08] wherever I'll feel that....
[1426.50] Greetings, Dad. Greetings, brother.
[1431.00] Greetings.
[1432.88] Excuse me.
[1437.95] -Brother, I wanted to talk to you about...
-Actually, Aima, send me those printouts
[1442.27] I have to get them printed and
submit them tomorrow morning.
[1452.12] You must be having real fun 
with all this situation.
[1457.17] You must be enjoying a lot.
[1460.65] Keep enjoying, because I'm going to snatch
all this happiness away from you real soon.
[1490.04] I feel proud that my children 
are going to help me with my business.
[1496.83] I have a lot of expectations with Aima.
[1498.90] This girl's future is really bright.
[1500.91] And, look, how merciful God has been
[1503.74] that Aima's university 
and now business are with Zaid.
[1508.11] Commuting is not going 
to be an issue. So just don't worry.
[1513.20] Once these kids learn about the business
[1517.12] then I'm going to hand it over to them 
and spend a carefree retired life.
[1521.60] Brother,
[1525.62] That's really nice
[1528.30] that you're hopeful about Aima's future.
[1532.10] But I'm not satisfied.
[1535.98] Regarding what?
[1537.80] No matter how well Aima studies,
[1542.37] how great her job is
[1544.74] but one thing bothers me all the time.
[1552.72] I know, you are referring to her marriage.
[1556.15] Yes, brother.
[1557.68] She is a girl and proposals for girls...
[1560.83] Shabana, you are 
just getting worried preemptively.
[1563.18] Just look at her age. 
There is still a lot of time.
[1566.76] You don't have 
to worry much regarding this issue.
[1572.60] Who knows what tomorrow holds.
[1575.26] You know very well about my health
condition, it gets worse suddenly.
[1580.01] I just want to fulfill my responsibility 
towards my child while I'm alive.
[1584.69] I want my daughter 
to get married in front of me.
[1589.00] I get really scared 
that if something happens to me then...
[1592.74] May God give you a long life.
Why are you being so pessimistic?
[1598.77] Life has tested me so much that now
[1605.55] I don't expect much from life.
[1608.50] Only thing I'm worried about 
is my daughter.
[1613.72] You always ask other to stay optimistic 
and you yourself are being so pessimistic.
[1618.75] Yes, brother, you're right.
[1623.99] We should always expect the best from God.
[1627.88] But I don't know,
[1630.01] at times I get really depressed.
[1638.97] And the reason behind it
is the worry about her marriage only.
[1645.22] Nothing else.
[1646.67] What do you think? Am I not
worried about Aima's wedding?
[1650.56] No, brother. I don't mean to say that.
[1655.28] I know that you are going 
to do what's best for Aima.
[1661.86] But what can I do?
[1665.33] After all I'm her mother.
[1669.80] Shabana, you must have noted, that whenever
you start the topic about Aima's marriage
[1673.60] then I avoid it.
[1675.93] That doesn't mean at all that
I'm not worried about her marriage.
[1680.30] In fact you can say that I have 
a good proposal for her in mind.
[1686.51] I have a guy in my mind for her.
[1689.14] But I'm just waiting 
for the right time and moment.
[1719.43] I've been looking for you 
in the whole house
[1721.19] and here you are sitting
peacefully playing games.
[1724.43] Can't I sit peacefully in my house now?
[1727.29] Of course, after losing all the property 
you should be at peace.
[1733.43] Nosheen, you have given us 
a huge shock along with sorrow.
[1740.43] That fraudster got away 
with such a huge amount of ours.
[1744.37] Just by thinking about it my heart sinks.
[1749.40] How would have I known 
that he is going to do this to me.
[1752.93] Oh you fool, 
that's what I used to tell you.
[1757.02] That guys in this category
trap silly girls like you in their love.
[1766.33] And then girls like you lose their
money, life everything over them.
[1773.14] Your dad has done a favor to you
[1778.54] by taking you back in.
[1780.40] For God's sake, Nosheen. Please have
mercy on us and get back to your senses.
[1785.08] Rectify your conduct.
[1786.94] This is your last chance.
[1789.41] Enough already.
[1790.49] You guys bothered me so much by
repeating one thing over and over again.
[1793.72] A human can commit mistakes.
[1796.97] Nosheen you are referring what you did
 as a mistake only?
[1804.61] No human can commit such mistakes 
what you have done.
[1809.52] Okay. But for your information I am telling
you that I have apologized to everyone.
[1816.67] But no one is ready to give up 
showing attitude.
[1821.35] Who are you talking about?
[1824.31] I'm talking about everyone.
[1828.51] Okay, dad is like that. But brother?
[1832.60] Why are his collars to stiff suddenly?
[1834.87] Talk with respect. 
He is your elder brother.
[1838.14] I am not going to respect anyone. 
Do they care about me?
[1842.09] What is wrong? What have they done?
[1844.55] I have never been so humiliated.
[1848.75] When I entered the house I greeted dad
[1851.60] and dad, he ignored me 
as if I don't even exist and he left.
[1858.54] And brother? He just crossed the limit.
[1861.93] He made me feel in front of Aima 
as if he was disgusted by me.
[1866.45] In front of that Aima.
[1868.26] Oh, so you wanted that they would have
welcomed you by showering you with flowers?
[1873.10] They should have given you a
reception like the Queen of England,
[1875.35] because you have done 
such a huge favor to be back home.
[1881.94] Don't try to pose as the oppressed one.
[1884.51] You are facing the consequences 
of what you have done.
[1887.92] And don't expect that I am going 
to take your side next time.
[1891.79] I don't even need you. Just go from here.
[1894.96] I am not interested to look at you either.
[1898.84] Just tell me that have you found out 
anything about that fraudster?
[1903.03] I don't care, I need each 
and every penny back from him.
[1907.33] I'm trying my best, Mama.
[1909.34] I am want to catch him as soon as
possible even more than you guys want it.
[1912.89] But what can I do alone, 
no body is supporting me.
[1916.34] I'm even ready to go to the police station
and even file a complaint against him.
[1921.92] -Well, it's good to know.
-What?
[1925.64] That you aren't involved 
with that idiot anymore.
[1969.76] I have a guy in mind for her.
[1972.33] But I am waiting 
for the right time and moment.
[1987.59] Did brother mean the same 
what I have understood?
[1997.00] If that's the case 
then I have no objection.
[2036.80] Why did I become unwanted
[2041.31] Nobody knows that
[2050.52] Nobody knows that.
[2055.43] There has been lot of change in Zaid 
in past few months.
[2060.89] There is one more child of yours 
in this house other than Zaid.
[2066.18] If you have taken her back in 
then why don't you forgive her as well?
[2071.65] Why do you keep mentioning her?
[2073.79] Isn't it enough 
that I have allowed her back home?
[2076.44] Actually, you dad has chosen a boy for you.
[2084.31] Really?
[2086.09] Yes, I don't know his name
[2089.79] but my heart tells me 
that he has chosen Zaid for you.
