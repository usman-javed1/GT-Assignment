[0.07] From flowers and from buds
[4.64] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.23] When I saw you
[14.38] I learned to chirp from you
[19.22] If you have got the news
then it must be good.
[23.17] No, but I want to here it from you.
[26.80] Yes Zaid, I'm, I'm expecting.
[30.52] Really? Thank you so much!
[33.29] Faiq has told me a lot about you too.
[36.10] Really? Like what?
[37.79] Like about your marriage
[40.72] and the toxic relationship
between you and your husband.
[46.76] I felt really bad about knowing it.
[48.72] Well, it's good now, because
you have another option now.
[53.50] You can trap anyone you like.
[55.23] Faiq, pick up your phone!
[62.47] What does the report say?
[67.28] Oh!
[75.07] Nosheen, your report is here.
You are expecting.
[154.73] Auntie, I just can't believe it.
[158.00] Yes, dear, the feeling of
becoming a mother is totally unique.
[162.87] It is such a huge honor.
[168.64] Now you'll see, gradually you are going
to get a sense of responsibility yourself.
[174.96] What do you mean? Do you mean
that I am irresponsible right now?
[180.19] Oh, no, you are my wise and nice daughter.
[187.29] It's just that you are so young
that's why you make mistakes.
[194.45] But I'm sure, Nosheen,
[196.75] you are going to prove yourself to be
the best mother and a wonderful wife.
[205.21] Okay, now get ready, quickly. We have to
tell this news to your mother's place too.
[211.00] But I have already called
her and told about it.
[214.36] Oh, you are not supposed to tell
such things just over the phone.
[221.44] WE would have got sweet
and then went to their place.
[224.45] Doesn't matter, we'll still go there.
[229.91] You go get ready and I'll get ready too.
[232.49] -Okay then, I'll tell mama.
-Fine.
[240.85] What are you thinking now?
[242.85] Well, auntie, I thought after
listening to such a great news
[247.09] Faiq is going to come
to me and talk to me.
[253.16] But I don't know where he has gone.
[256.13] That's why I left you two alone,
[259.53] so that you both can end the
complains you have with each other
[263.55] and be okay with each other.
[266.06] Nothing of this sort happened. I'm telling
you auntie, Faiq doesn't love me anymore.
[276.24] Whatever happens after
10-20 years of marriage,
[280.52] our marriage has become like that.
[285.62] And if not anything else,
[288.44] he definitely has something
going on with Sania.
[291.26] Okay, just listen to me, firstly
there must be nothing as such, I'm sure.
[298.07] But even if there is anything like that
[301.45] then I'm always going to support you.
[307.59] And if Faiq even thinks
of something like that,
[311.65] I am never going to
talk to him then, okay?
[315.96] Auntie, are you sure you
are going to support me?
[320.37] Of course.
[347.31] What is all the stuff
you have got, Almas?
[349.74] I just couldn't wait.
[351.37] I have started it from now. Whatever I may
find and I like it, I'm going to buy it.
[356.54] -But, mom, isn't this a bit too much?
-Not at all.
[359.90] No, we didn't even know
yet if it's a boy or a girl.
[363.67] All kids are equal, and besides
you mother is very clever,
[367.77] I have brought such
things which both may use.
[370.89] Check out her excitement, and
she has done all her planning.
[374.69] Well, why don't you tell him,
you have made a lot of plans yourself.
[377.63] Tell him what you were telling me earlier.
[379.20] I was just saying that we should make
a separate room for the baby in this house.
[384.81] Dad, I think it's too early.
[386.95] Yeah I know, but you have no
idea how happy we are, Zaid.
[391.45] I know that becoming
a father is something great
[393.94] but the children of your children
they give you so much pleasure.
[397.22] Yes, I can see that.
[399.28] Believe me, I have forgotten all my worries
and sorrows just by getting this news.
[403.91] Oh, finally happiness has
seen the way to our home.
[407.70] Zaid, where's Zoya?
[409.77] Actually, Zoya went to the hospital,
she had an appointment with the doctor.
[413.84] Why didn't you go with her then?
[416.20] Auntie took her.
[417.95] No, but you should take care
of her, next time you should go.
[421.25] I said that I'll take her but actually
auntie knew the doctor personally
[424.74] so she said I'll take her.
[426.61] Yeah, okay, but you
should go with her next time.
[430.03] Okay.
[431.65] -I think they are...
-Looks like Zoya is back.
[434.78] I think it must be her, they
have been gone for long.
[438.37] -Oh, greetings.
-Greetings, Amber.
[441.74] -Come sit.
-Sure, brother Azmat.
[445.58] -Zoya, how was the doctor's visit?
-It was all right.
[450.44] The doctor has said that by
grace of God, everything is perfect.
[455.41] You both came at such a good time.
[458.77] Just see what your sister has
got for the baby from the market.
[465.06] Oh, great!
[469.85] Well, my daughter has
give such a big news to you.
[473.92] So we shall celebrate as much as we can.
[477.13] Yes, we'll have liveliness
in our house too now.
[482.34] It's good that I have found
all three of you together.
[486.63] I wanted to talk about
something important.
[491.84] Oh forget that, than God you guys are
here, let's take a look at the stuff I got.
[496.10] Sister, please, what I am about to
say is more important than this stuff.
[502.41] So, kindly listen to me.
[505.05] Wait a second, Almas.
[508.55] Go ahead, Amber, what is it?
[510.89] Brother Azmat, I am not going to
waste time in beating about the bush.
[520.62] And neither do I want
to repeat old things.
[527.51] I just wanted to say that I want to
see my daughter happy in this condition.
[532.23] Not tensed.
[536.70] What is it, will you say it now?
[539.75] Zoya isn't happy here.
[550.05] After he has remarried.
[554.20] Auntie, but I have already
talked to Zoya about it.
[557.74] I'm not finished yet, Zaid.
[562.82] I am going to say something very simple.
[565.56] If you all want that Zoya's child is born,
[574.29] then Zaid must leave Aima.
[583.54] What?
[652.55] Faiq, what are you doing here?
[657.53] Nothing, Mom, just sitting here.
[660.31] Did you meet Nosheen?
[663.09] Yeah, I went to the room
but I think she is asleep.
[667.69] Then you should have waken her up,
she has been waiting for you for so long.
[670.84] Wait, let me wake her up.
[672.21] No, Mom, let her sleep.
[674.83] What is it Faiq? I've told you such a
big news but you don't seem happy.
[681.89] No, Mom, it's nothing
like that. I'm happy.
[685.33] Yeah, right, is this how one gets happy?
[687.92] Go look at you face in the mirror.
[692.23] Seems as if you have heard a bad news.
[695.97] Mom, I'm a human too.
[697.74] My feelings, my emotions, don't
they mean anything to you guys?
[701.64] Of course they do. What are you saying?
[705.53] Then the girl with whom I can't
be happy for a single moment,
[708.94] you are asking me to celebrate
with her? How can that be?
[717.43] -I can understand.
-No, you can't.
[722.10] Neither you are getting
it, nor anyone else.
[727.30] Everyone is just celebrating
the entry of a new member, that's it.
[733.15] Did you ever thing about
the kid who is yet to come?
[735.50] He is going to watch his parents
fight everyday. How is he going to feel?
[739.73] Are we going to give him this environment?
[741.39] You are thinking about way ahead.
[744.12] Why shouldn't I think about future.
[746.12] We have to think about it
before bringing him to this world.
[752.01] What kind of environment
can we provide him?
[753.63] He is going to complain to us, and
ask us why we brought him in this world.
[757.48] -The what?
-But all this can change too.
[761.48] How?
[762.59] You will change it, Faiq, you.
[765.98] -Because you are the father.
-And what about the mother?
[770.61] Doesn't the mother has any responsibility?
[775.53] Yes, she is responsible too.
[781.07] -Just give her some time, she'll get better.
-Do you have any surety, Mom?
[785.62] -No, I don't have any surety, but...
-No ifs and buts.
[790.36] She can never get better.
[792.29] You don't have any surety for this even.
[794.98] Mom, can't you see what she is doing?
[797.90] I do, I see everything.
[802.33] That's the reason why I
was against this decision,
[805.10] but you didn't listen to me then.
[810.58] And now I am taking care of your decision.
[815.41] And I want that you don't run
away from you responsibilities,
[818.84] rather fulfill them.
[820.25] Didn't you see what she did
to my friend the other day?
[824.37] -Faiq, just forget that.
-How can I?
[827.81] Mom, she is my friend.
[829.60] She is your friend and this is your wife.
[834.74] Don't forget that.
[836.20] A wife has more rights.
[838.84] Does this mean that she can
misbehave with all my friends like this?
[842.38] Faiq, she wasn't
insulting all your friends.
[845.80] Oh, this means that she can
misbehave with Sania only?
[849.41] If She doesn't like your
and Sania's friendship
[852.23] then let go of your friendship with her.
[854.43] Why? Why should I let go
of this friendship? She is my friend.
[857.82] Enough, Faiq. You have said
a lot and I have heard a lot.
[864.81] Now listen to what I am saying.
[869.18] Do one thing,
[873.10] put yourself in her place.
[876.29] If Nosheen had such a friend,
would you have tolerated it?
[885.39] I know that you couldn't.
And nobody can even.
[892.05] Now listen to what I am
saying and do it as I say.
[895.86] Get up from here, go talk to
Nosheen and end all this dispute.
[900.76] Please, Mom, I don't
feel like talking to her.
[904.27] Faiq, the dispute between
husband and wife aren't long lasting.
[908.68] It's just temporary anger
which fades out in a little while.
[917.60] But remember one thing, only
when someone wants it to fade out.
[923.33] Do you get what I am saying?
[928.46] Give me sometime, I'll be normal again.
[958.24] What did Amber say?
We haven't even celebrated properly yet.
[964.03] Was this the time to
say something like that?
[966.93] I can understand, obviously Amber is
Zoya's mother, she is worried about her.
[972.00] But is this the way?
[975.59] And there are no two opinions about it
[978.44] that no mother wants her daughter
[981.77] being imposed by her husband's
second wife all the time, but still...
[985.30] The ifs and buts you are saying,
I know very well what they mean.
[989.39] But understand one thing
clearly and memorize it too,
[996.60] The evil demands
that Amber has brought forward,
[999.34] they can't be fulfilled until I'm alive.
[1004.20] Rest is up to God.
[1006.10] So to save Aima's marriage
shall we let go of our son?
[1012.61] Shall we forget like
nothing had ever happened?
[1015.95] We are not going to
compromise over anything.
[1022.17] And your sister should have thought a
thousand times before saying this thing,
[1025.55] the cheap and unethical
thing that she has said.
[1032.36] These are relationships, not a deal.
[1034.25] That when the contract ends
she puts a condition to renew it
[1036.54] otherwise they will end.
[1039.80] Both those mother and daughter
shall realize that a child is God's gift,
[1048.00] which they are using
as a tool to blackmail us.
[1053.02] And as far as the baby is concerned
[1054.87] then Zaid has as much
right on him as Zoya has.
[1059.50] So she can't do it
without Zaid's permission,
[1062.09] tell that clearly to your sister too.
[1065.22] If she listened to me
[1067.90] she wouldn't have said all these
things in front of everyone, Azmat.
[1072.54] So you mean to say that you
can't do anything in this regard?
[1079.19] Azmat, I'll talk to her for
sure but you should also...
[1083.05] I am not interested in
hearing what she has to say.
[1086.53] Zaid will not leave Aima,
that's my final decision.
[1090.74] But, Mr. Azmat, why don't you
ask Zaid once what he wants?
[1094.74] You and your sister shall remember
one thing, you shall tell her that too,
[1101.33] that as soon as you both understand
it, it is as better for you both.
[1106.47] Go now, I need to rest.
[1118.27] Conditions. A new story everyday.
[1132.59] There must be a chaos
at Azmat Hussain's house.
[1135.79] Everyone must be burning with rage.
[1138.51] Mom, we have given them a huge shock.
[1142.46] What if something wrong happens?
[1145.14] What do you mean? What can go wrong?
[1147.63] I mean, uncle is a heart patient.
[1155.41] What if anything happens to
him because of tension?
[1159.97] Nothing is going to happen to him.
Azmat Hussain is one tough nut.
[1167.37] He may give a heart attack to
others but nothing will happen to him.
[1174.52] And don't you worry at all.
[1177.10] Because Zaid is going
to leave Aima for sure.
[1179.96] He has got no other option.
[1182.36] We should be the one getting worried,
because we have lied.
[1187.84] And besides, if Zaid gets
to know about the reality,
[1194.67] what do you think, Mama?
What is he going to do?
[1201.30] Will he ever going to look at me again?
[1203.92] Who is telling him? He will only
know what you are going to tell him.
[1210.00] And when are we going to tell
him about it, I have decided that.
[1217.13] Just make up your mind.
[1219.08] Either do as I say or else you
will have to live your life like this.
[1227.20] Mom, even if nobody tells
him, what if he finds out himself?
[1234.54] What if he takes me to the doctor?
[1240.40] Or if he asks for my reports?
[1242.90] Well, who knows you might
actually get pregnant by then.
[1250.87] Seriously, and this problem gets resolved.
[1258.96] Still, Mom, won't he
keep a count of months?
[1265.43] He is an educated, wise boy.
[1271.24] Oh, what have
I got myself into?
[1273.05] Please, Zoya, don't
think about so far ahead.
[1280.89] Just think about how to
move out from that house.
[1283.84] I know what you are planning.
[1287.61] You will tell me to tell Zaid
that I have had a miscarriage.
[1294.83] Besides, Mom, one has to tell
a hundred lies to cover a single lie.
[1300.44] Zoya, relax, you are overthinking.
[1305.00] -Tell me, did you think of that?
-Yeah.
[1309.15] We will have to do like that,
and there's nothing wrong with it.
[1311.71] And why are you feeling so guilty?
[1316.06] Actually Zaid has deceived you, and
your deception is nothing compared to his.
[1334.34] Tell me, did Zaid call you?
[1337.14] No, he must be angry with me on this.
[1340.82] He will call. He must be busy.
[1344.21] A child is such a thing that
most of the people get corrected.
[1365.44] And look at this rocking
chair. Isn't it nice?
[1370.00] After dad gets better,
then after a week we’ll...
[1375.02] Zoya!
[1377.51] I can't shift right now.
[1380.82] I'm not asking you to shift right
now, we'll shift when dad gets better.
[1386.16] You didn't get me.
[1388.37] What I am trying to say is
that for now I can not shift .
[1394.18] What do you mean for now?
[1397.80] Dad is not well at all and
I can't leave him like that.
[1415.39] Zaid, you aren't ready yet?
We had to go for a meeting.
[1419.90] Quickly, get ready, we're getting late.
[1423.16] If you don't mind, can you
attend the meeting in my place?
[1426.76] Okay, I'll go then.
[1429.30] Listen, don't go alone. Go
with the driver, the car is outside.
[1434.93] Is everything all right, Zaid?
[1438.82] Yes, actually there was another important
thing so I thought of doing that.
[1442.75] You can take car of the meeting.
[1445.27] All right.
[1450.48] Shall I get some tea made for you?
[1454.35] Sorry, did you ask me anything?
[1456.97] I was asking if you
wanted to have some tea.
[1461.81] No, it's okay. You can have some.
[1465.25] Okay, I'll get going then.
[1495.56] Faiq,
[1498.30] aren't you even a little happy
after knowing about my pregnancy?
[1504.02] How do you think such things, Nosheen?
[1508.86] Obviously, what else can I think?
[1512.92] Neither you have said anything,
in fact you went away.
[1521.30] Look, Nosheen, I want
things to get better between us.
[1528.64] We shall stay happy so that the
environment in the house improves.
[1531.69] But you don't let that happen.
[1536.35] You keep complaining all the time.
[1541.23] How am I feeling right now,
I can't tell you how happy I am.
[1545.38] Then express it. Until you
tell me how am I going to know?
[1550.40] You aren't saying anything.
[1552.66] Look, I don't like you
taunting me on everything.
[1557.88] If you want to know how I feel
you can ask them politely too.
[1563.79] There you go, your lecture has started.
[1567.50] I'm not lecturing you,
just telling you something very basic.
[1572.25] Every good wife shall have an idea
what her husband likes or dislikes.
[1576.14] This way the environment
of the house remains good.
[1579.81] Now tell me, do I had to get such a good
news this way? While fighting with you?
[1586.54] Tell me?
[1590.28] Anyway, what's done is done.
[1595.61] Nosheen, I want things
to get better between us.
[1600.80] We shouldn't be fighting
all the time be it any issue.
[1605.69] And you should work with me for it.
[1608.21] I should try only, you won't?
[1611.79] I will. Tell me, what do you want?
What can I do for you?
[1617.20] What do you think, I don't notice
that you ignore me or don't talk to me?
[1627.49] You think it's easy? It hurts me a lot.
[1631.35] But what difference does it make to you?
[1635.89] You know what I feel, Faiq?
That you are just fed up of me.
[1641.88] Okay, sorry, I apologize.
[1649.37] From now on I won't do
anything which may hurt you.
[1656.62] -But you should promise me too.
-Okay.
[1661.83] Nosheen, I want to clear one more thing.
[1665.38] Neither I love Sania,
nor I have an affair with her.
[1669.51] She is just my friend, that's it.
[1672.04] Are you telling the truth?
[1675.06] -I swear upon you.
-No, I don't believe on you swearing over me.
[1679.04] You don't even love me.
You are swearing falsely.
[1683.07] Swear upon you unborn
child that you don't love Sania.
[1688.46] Okay fine, if you may get
satisfied this way,
[1691.88] then I swear upon our unborn
child, I'm telling the truth.
[1716.49] Did you see what your son has done,
[1718.82] he didn't talk to me even
after such a good news.
[1722.09] And don't know where he has gone now.
[1724.05] That's why I left you both
alone and came to my room
[1727.90] that you both may cheer
up and end your dispute.
[1731.37] Nothing of this sort happened.
I went to my room
[1735.24]  and thought Faiq would come after
me talk to me and apologize.
[1739.51] But he didn't talk to me at all.
[1742.34] Congratulations to you too. May
God give good fate to our kids.
[1746.91] Please carry on, I'll be right back.
[1755.91] People have such dads who
forgive their children's mistakes.
[1760.12] And here my dad, he isn't even
happy for me on such a big news.
[1764.72] He will only be happy when I'll die.
[1767.06] Were you doing anything important?
[1771.69] No.
[1773.29] I hope I didn't disturb you.
[1776.47] Now what does that mean?
