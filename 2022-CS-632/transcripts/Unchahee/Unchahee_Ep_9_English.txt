From flowers and from buds I have learnt to bloom
and be fragrant When I saw you I learnt how to chirp from you It's the same guy who
messaged me the other day. He has been sending me messages since
last night, I have just had it with him. -Who is it?
-I don't know. So, what is he saying? Aima, from where did this guy
get such private picture of yours? I don't know. Zoya. I don't know. Zoya he is a picture
of me where I am sleeping. And I have know idea who took
this picture of me sleeping and when, and how he got it. Look, I think you should
take him more seriously, okay? And you shouldn't come to university alone
like this. You should come with Aid. We don't know who he is and what he wants? I'm really scared, Zoya. I am too scared. Just  don't worry,
nothing is going to happen. Sit down. Oh, just a second.
 Hello. Yes, Haris? I asked you something to do. What? The number isn't registered,
how is it possible? Fine. Okay, by. Thank you. Aima, this guy is  something. We can't even track his number. I think he is after me for a reason. Just ask him what he wants. Zoya... He wants that I should meet him alone. And if I don't do it,
he is going to get my pictures viral. He has been threatening me a lot.
I am really scared, Zoya. Let's do one thing then, let's involve
the police. I have my sources. Okay, let's find him first
and then hand it over to the police. No, no. We can't do that. If this thing reaches the house, it's going
to be a huge trouble for me then, Zoya. What if he becomes my enemy after that,
and puts someone else after me? What am I going to do, Zoya?
 I am really scared. It's not going to work this way,
and then you haven't told Zaid either. If we don't do something about
that guy he is going to get crazy and will do whatever he likes. -Do one thing. Go meet him.
-No. I a not going to meet him alone. No, idiot, not alone. I mean, we will go together and meet
him and find out what he wants. I think this matter can't be solved easily. We can just try to know what he wants. Zoya, I... I don't want to take any risks. Aima, it's better to face him instead
of getting tortured everyday. And he has got your pictures too,
so he can do anything. That's true. Look, if we see his face once
then we can find out his name too and at least we will have
something to blackmail him. Don't worry, I am with you,
no need to be scared. You are right. Do one thing.
Decide a place and time, okay? I will come with you, okay? Okay? -Mother, what are you doing?
-Oh, dear, I got tired while sitting idle,
so I thought of doing some dusting. Mother, why don't you listen to anyone.
The doctor has instructed you to take rest. Nothing is going to happen.
One should do such small chores. Nobody can convince you. Okay let me freshen up and get back. Wait. Did something happen? No, what's wrong? Brother came to me.
Said, "Come to me after Aima gets back." He has to talk about something important. What is it? What are you thinking? No, nothing. Okay then go, change and we will go to him. Why do I need to change?
Let's go to him directly. Yes, that's okay too. Has it ever happened that I have
made a decision in this house -with which you don't agree to?
-No, brother. Did I ever differentiate
between you both and others? That's never happened. 
But why are you asking, brother? Because, Shabana, I want that not two 
but a single family lives in this house, and every person in the
house has equal importance. By the grace of God, brother, you
have never discriminated anyone, and you have given 
equal importance to everyone. But I think... I think that I haven't. I have realized that Almas and Nosheen have adopted an unfair behavior 
with you two. Is that true? No, brother, it's nothing like that. I have got no complains
with sister and Nosheen. And Nosheen is my child, 
whatever she says I never mind it. You tell me , Aima. She is never going to tell me the truth 
and I want to know the truth. At times, auntie and sometimes Nosheen, make us realize that this isn't our house. No, brother, she doesn't know anything, 
she is just a child. And you know she is a bit sensitive,
so takes every little thing to her heart. Why didn't you bring
 it to my attention then? You call me father. If I am in your father's place, then one
doesn't hide anything from their father. Yes, father. I don't tell it to you 
to keep the peace at home. It's my job to worry 
about the peace at home. If you both will stay quiet at
what is happening with you  then we are actually going 
to lose the peace of our home. I am the eldest in this house. So being the head of the family
I am answerable to God. Brother, I don't want to burden you 
with such petty issues. Shabana, I wish there was just this burden
in my life that you are burdening me with. Aima, who told brother, all this? Did you tell Zaid about it? Oh, Aima! At times you act really stupidly. What benefit would it give, tell me? In fact it will increase brother's problems. Sit here. I have to talk to you. Everything all right?
 Did the boy's family respond? -No.
-Then? You tell me that have I ever deprived
you or your children of their right? What kind of a question is this? -It is a question and you have to answer it.
-No And has it ever happened that there is 
any need of yours that I haven't fulfilled? Is everything all right? Answer the question that
I am asking, quietly. -Yes.
-In fact, I don't even remember that I have overlooked any of your needs,
 that I didn't fulfill. -It is like that.
-Have I asked anything in return? I am frightened now, Azmat, just tell me,
why are you creating so much suspense? All I have asked is just one thing 
and that is consideration. So, have I ever been inconsiderate to you? I am not talking about me, 
but about my sister and her daughter. I don't have anyone else in this
world other than my sister. Neither she is left
with any one else than me. You must understand that Shabana
lives here because she needs to. And I am as responsible 
for her as I am for you. Tell me, Azmat, what complain
 does Shabana have with me? Just accept Shabana and Aima. 
They are a part of this house. Till when are you going to keep
 these useless thoughts in your mind? If you value them sincerely, 
then they will love you too. Azmat, just tell me
what did she complain about me? This means that you have 
done something complain able. First tell me what they have told you. You leave that, and concentrate 
on what I have said. And tell Nosheen also to think
 of Aima as her sister. I try my best, but I don't know what special treatment
do you want me to give to your sister. If your behaviour was okay with them, there
would have been no room for complains. I don't understand what Shabana wants. She has been living here peacefully
 since so many years. She eats and wears the best,
what else do they want? This, exactly this. 
The way you are rubbing it in. Have you ever rubbed it 
in Nosheen's or Zaid's face? God doesn't give that right to anyone, and even if He did you wouldn't
have been entitled to it. Azmat, we spend two days
together with peace and my heart tells me that someone
is going to poison you eventually. What nonsense are you talking?
 Are you aware of what you are saying? Try to give peace to others 
and God will fill your heart with peace. Forget it. I am never going 
to get peace in this house. You are not even aware of what peace is. I don't know what kind
 of a test it is for me. Me and Azmat don't stay happy 
for four days together  and you bring up a new issue 
so that we start fighting again. Mother, please. If God has taken away your husband, 
what is my fault in it? Why have I become unwanted No body knows that. Why have I become unwanted No body knows that. Where is that guy? He isn't here yet. Message him. Look, I have messaged him,
 he didn't see it. -Come, let's leave. 
-Where to? Sit, he must be here somewhere. What are you doing? I am just checking that he might be
one of them. You should check too. Zoya, if someone sees us here then it's going to be a huge
trouble for us, come let's go now. Nothing is going to happen. 
Just try one last time. You have his other numbers, right? -Yes.
-Then try on them. But they are blocked. Oh, God, my child, you are so dumb. Unblock him, so that we know 
that we tried to contact him. Can't get through. I swear if someone had
done this with me, I would have broken his jaw,
and given him to the police. -Let's go.
-You are such a coward. Too coward. Let's go. Auntie, where is Aima? She has gone somewhere with Zoya. Zoya? Why didn't she tell me, 
did she tell you? She didn't tell me where she is going 
but she said that, " I will be back in a while." What happened? 
Did you get in contact with them? I am getting in contact but they
don't want to stay in contact. -Meaning?
-They are disconnecting my calls. Don't get angry, 
they will be back in a while. I don't know why they don't
tell me anything these days. Look, son, somethings are
between girlfriends only, and they should remain between them. You get so angry, huh. Look what this is. Oh, thank you, just what I wanted. Yes, I know it very well since your
childhood, why you come to my room. To get a chocolate. And to tell you the truth, 
I buy and keep chocolate for you only. I love you, auntie. Shabana, tell me clearly what do you want? That me and Nosheen should
get out of our own home? -What are you saying, sister?
-Exactly what you have heard, that you can't see us happy. -Mama, what are you talking about?
-Just keep quiet , Zaid. This dear auntie of yours is
poisoning your dad's ears against me. No, I haven't talked to brother. If you hadn't said anything, 
Azmat wouldn't have scolded me so much. The world may feel pity
on your miserable face, but don't you dare try this
cunningness in front of me. Look, sister you must be mistaken. Mama, look if you have to talk 
then please sit down and talk calmly. Me and Azmat don't stay happy
 for a few days, and you raise a new issue 
so that we both start fighting. Mama, please. If God has taken away your husband
from you, what is my fault in it? Why are you jealous of me and my husband? Why do you cast an evil eye on him? Mother, you have no right
to misbehave with auntie. Please go from here. I thought just my husband is
in your control only. But you have also used my son against
me, like a pawn in the game of chess, see! Mama, listen please,
go from here right now. Just leave. I don't know what is wrong. I am really sorry, auntie.
Let me talk to dad. I'm really sorry, auntie, I... Faisal, your editing is outclass. 
Aima must be sleepless with anxiety. Yes she was showing too much attitude. Since I sent her the pictures, 
she has fallen into my feet You should give me the credit for that. It was so difficult for me to take her
pictures in her room when she was asleep. Don't let her be at ease even for a minute. Don't worry about that at all, 
your work is being done properly. Tell me, will she come to meet? She will not go, she is gone to meet. Anyways, I have sent Amir, 
let's see what does he report. Man, I'm really happy. It's going to be so
much fun when she gets humiliated by dad. By the way tell me one thing, you are getting all this by Amir, right? I hope you aren't talking to Aima yourself. No why would I talk to her? Because you get really excited when it
comes to girls, that's why I'm asking. Come, on, it's not like that. Don't you talk to any other girl, 
or else you know me well. -Oh, so now you are threatening me?
-No I'm just showing love. Anyways, when are we planning to meet?
It has been so many days now. Faisal, are you in your senses? I have
gotten my phone after so much trouble, that too mama's phone, 
and you are talking about meeting? What's with a phone, if you say 
I can send you a new one right now. Just send your proposal officially, 
when I tell you to. Okay, listen, what about the money?
When are you going to transfer that? Yeah, don't worry, I'll do it. Where were you guys? Couldn't find you both in the university, and you weren't taking my calls either,
 what's going on? Actually it was really crowded outside. Where? Where was it crowded? -Mall.
-Park. Think clearly, was it mall or park? First we went to the park and then... No, no, first we went to the mall and then we went to the park, and outside
the park there was an exhibition, so we thought of taking a look at it. Okay, fine, so what was in it 
to hide from me? Actually... there was a problem. There was a board outside the mall that it is not allowed to take
unnecessary stuff inside. -Wasn't it funny?
-No, you aren't funny at all. Seriously you just eat up our brains.
We can't take you along everywhere. I am not so keen either
to go with you guys everywhere. It's just that I was wondering why
you guys aren't attending my calls. Sorry, Daddy. Listen, Zaid, could you
drop me home please? Wow, you have to do all the things
in the world alone and now... now you are even going on dates alone. Where I went, it is called
a meeting not a date. Right? I am not like you
to go on dates secretly. And besides I went 
with my mom's permission. Zoya, don't touch me on the raw, please. Anyway, tell me, how was the boy? -Mind blowing.
-Oh, details? Drop me home, I'll give
you all the details. Hey, look at her, madam. Which new province is she planning to form? What? Were you guys talking about me? No, no we were just thinking
that because we were laughing, your imaginary pilaf might not get burnt. So, please carry on, I'll just go 
and provide her my driving services. -Shall we go, ma'am? 
-Yes, let's go driver, pick this bag please. and follow me, okay? Okay, bye, Aima. Driver! Bag. I wanted to meet you alone, and you
came with a whole procession there. Listen mister, that is not your problem. Yes, it is your problem,
 but things will be done my way. If you want hat you pictures reach
you safely, then come and get them. Why did I become unwanted No one knows that Why did I become unwanted No one knows that What happened? I have had this with this
mother and daughter. Come on, Mama, find some new people 
to fight with. I am fed up of looking at old fights. I have scolded Shabana
so much today, she will keep her mouth
shut for months now. What? They have become very clever
they have complained to your dad about us. -Us, means mine too?
-Yes,  They are becoming braver day by day. Mama, I think Aima has done it,
because auntie isn't that brave. -For now I took care of Shabana.
-You did good, but these people won't give up so easily. If they won't then they will keep
listening to my scolding like this. Mama, play the game in such a way
 that you win from both sides. What do you mean? Means, scold auntie too, and stay
naive in front of dad as well. -How?
-Mama, play a double game. Before she goes and
complain about you to dad, you just go to dad and pretend that you
have been wronged and start crying. I did the same the other day. I made Aima cry, and then in front of dad
I pretended that Aima hates me. Oh, Nosheen, you are something. I am something special, I swear. You have taken after Shabana for sure. I have already told you 
that I am your duplicate. No, niece and aunt belong 
to the same family. It can be, because I also know how 
to get things done by shedding false tears. -See?
-But auntie doesn't misbehave. And when it comes to misbehaving, 
I have taken after you completely. Shame less girl, you are calling
your mother ill mannered? -Your heaven is under my feet.
-That's what I am giving regard. By the way, what have you thought
about the proposals you are getting? We'll see when they come. Don't do anything stupid this time, okay? Winking, peeking, no need
for all that this time. Why, Mama? it's so much
fun scaring boys away. If your dad sees it, he is going 
to break your legs first and then mine. That would be great, this way at least
I will stop getting any proposals. You are a very cheap man. You wasted my time. Aren't you ashamed even a little bit?
You called me and didn't show up yourself? If you are so brave then you
should have come and talked to me. I wanted to meet you alone, 
and you came with a procession. Listen, mister, this isn't your problem. Yes it is your problem, 
but things will be done my way. If you want that your
pictures reach you safely then come and get
them, that too alone. And listen, come alone this time. And don't tell anyone at
home where you are going. I am not coming to meet
you now, understood? Fine, you will be responsible
of you infamy then. Your pictures instead of reaching you
will either go over the Internet, or they will reach any
family member of yours. I hope you won't do any mistake this time. I am going to text you
the time and location. Bye. What are you both up to? What's wrong, Zaid? You both are acting like
weird secret agents. You guys go out without
even telling anything. I don't get at all what you are saying. Who has gone out and where? -Aima is with you right now, isn't she?
-No, I'm at home. Are you joking? I really don't know where Aima is. Why don't you ask auntie Shabana, 
she might have told her before leaving. She just told auntie that
she is going with a friend. and she has no friend other than you. -I am really worried about her.
-Worried, what for? She has been acting so weirdly
since past few days, you know, she goes to the university by herself. Keeps
strolling at night on the roof top alone. And she went with you too the other
day, and she didn't even tell me. Something is going on between you
both that you are hiding from me. Just chill, no need to worry, she might
have gone somewhere but she'll be back. And you know she went so secretly
 that nobody knew about it. Zaid, she might have gone somewhere. I mean why do you start choking
when she goes somewhere? Because she never goes without telling me. Besides, I needed a suggestion
from her, regarding Kinza's gift. By the way, why are you giving
so many gifts to Kinza? Did she just got back after pilgrimage? She will go for pilgrimage with me only. Zaid, you have actually
gone blind in her love. Not blind, I have actually
started seeing the world now. Oh, come on, drama queen. -Anyway, listen, are you free right now?
-Yes, had to do a few things. Just put those thing on hold, I am
coming to pick you up, get ready. Where are we going? I have to get a gift for Kinza. Now that Aima isn't here, you can
come with me as her replacement. Replacement? I want to be 
the first priority of everyone, okay? You know, these tantrums of yours, they are
the real cause that you are still single. Okay, Miss first priority, get ready, 
I'm coming to pick you. Okay, bye. Faisal, you are a genius. 
You planned it out so well. Aima's pictures seem so suspicious. Whoever is going to see it, they will
get a clear picture of the whole story, that this girl has gone to meet a guy,
and she is very comfortable about it. Thank you so much, man. 
You have made me really happy. You ask me something and I
don't do it, is it possible? No need to be a hero now, it is you that has made my life hell. Neither we would have gone to that cursed
party, nor my dad would have caught me. What's done is done. Just do one thing now, 
arrange the money as soon as possible. Because the guy I have hired to
this work is very professional. So I can't any kind of risk. And what if Aima had brought your
brother along, then what? Yes, he has taken the risk, 
and has done a good job too. Don't worry about his payment, I am going
to transfer as much as he asks for. Wow, this means Azmat enterprises
is doing good business. Behave. Dad has done just one
good thing in his life. -What's that.
-His business. Listen, would your dad throw 
this poor girl out on this thing? Why? What do you care? Still, I mean we trapped her. What's your problem with it then? At least I should have an idea
what punishment she may get. No need to be on her side, there are
already too many people doing that. I am confined to this
home for so long, you have never worried
about me so much, Faisal. Look, listen to me, if you want to fight with
me then I am hanging up. Okay, you know what the
next step will be, right? Just make a final edit and do this
thing for me quickly, please. -Okay boss.
-It's going to be so much fun. Okay, listen, I think someone is
coming, so I gotta go now, bye. Say here whatever you want to say, 
I am not going to come inside. We can't talk here. Come inside. I have told you, talk here, 
I'm not going to go inside. People are going to listen here, I can't
talk here try to understand, please come in. Come. Come in, come.  Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that.  Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that. I love you, Aima. You cheap man, if you
contact me ever again, then I swear I am going 
to involve the police, understood? When I told you not to discuss it,
 why did you do it then? -Discuss what?
-The one with Auntie and Nosheen. What happened? Dad, are you okay? Dad? Aima, get some water. -I think, are you getting a heart attack?
-Dad?
