From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned to chirp from you Okay, hold on. Mom and me were waiting
for you over dinner. Okay, you guys start, I'll join you. Look, Zaid, it's very simple. Just tell me who do you want
in your life. Aima or me? And if you can't leave Aima
then you should divorce me. For God's sake, tell them to
have some mercy on my daughter. Yes, of course sister, now
that you have talked to me I will talk to sister
Nimra about it for sure. And if necessary I will talk to Faiq too. Nosheen, trust me dear. Don't you dare call me dear.
I am not dear to you. Will you just stop being sarcastic? Can't we sit and talk like normal people? Really? Is everything
normal like it used to be? It's only things like these
that you say which hurt me. Of course it's only
what I say that hurts you. That's why you go to Aima to vent out. It's nothing like that, Zoya. Having a good time? Don't you lie to me, Zaid. And I'm sorry I ruined
your moment with her. It seemed as if you are on a honeymoon
flight and I have come like bad weather. You think I was lying? When did I say that? Zoya if you have even a little doubt,
you may inquire at the airline office. Right, like this is the only thing
I have to do to keep inquiring. Relax. No need to get
tensed on such small things. And okay, I believe that
you are telling the truth. You have never lied, you are too truthful. What is this mark on your hand? Don't you know? -I don't know.
-It's a gift from you, Zaid. You are responsible
for my every agony, Zaid. This is a wound that is visible to you. There are many wounds
that aren't visible to you. Anyway, I asked you to take a decision. what have you decided? I have decided. I have decided that I can't leave Aima. Now think of it as my
compulsion or whatever. But that's the truth. This means that you
are going to divorce me? -No, Zoya, I can't even think about it.
-Then what do you want? I want to carry on with both the relationships. This is what you want, Zaid. Not me. Besides, I asked you to
choose among only two options. Not to bring in a third option. Try to understand,
Zoya, I can't do anything. Okay, I will let mom know then.
Till then let me pack my stuff. Move. Zoya, for God's sake. Instead of understanding my compulsion
you are threatening me on everything. I am not threatening you , Zaid. I
am just expressing my intentions. Zoya, please don't be so cruel with me. Of course, I am the one
who has done all the cruelty. You can live your life
happily when I leave. I don't want this at all,
Zoya, I swear I love you! Stop it, Zaid. And don't you say stupid
things like love and all to me. These techniques are obsolete now. Okay. I think you don't want to
understand my problem. Problem? What do you mean? Why are you pretending
to be so helpless? If you can get married when you were
forced to, why can;t you give divorce then? Besides, I am asking you to use your right. I am not asking you to murder her. Zoya, it is not necessary that
a person uses his every right. And have I ever deprived
you of any of your rights? Have I ever tried to
hurt you intentionally? Tell me. No, not at all. You have
given me all my rights. It's just that you have imposed
your second wife on me. That's not injustice, right? Zaid, just let me know one thing. Are you in love with Aima? She is just a compulsion for you, right? Hmm. What hmm? Answer me. Do you love Aima or me? What kind of a question is this, Zoya?
Of course I love you. Why don't you just leave her then? Zaid, it's really difficult for me.
I can't share you with anyone. Besides, seeing your husband with
someone else everyday isn't that easy. And I admit that you
both needed each other, and whenever you needed
something you asked Aima for it. I was never the one you needed. But now, I want that she doesn't
remain someone you need. She isn't the one I need, Zoya,
she is just my compulsion, I swear. I can't leave her. Please try to understand.
I live in dad's house. Only his rules are followed
here, I can't go against it. And Zoya, if I talk to her pleasantly
for a few minutes everyday, what difference would it make to you? You know, dad is noticing everything. He will just get a little satisfaction. Why are you smiling? Wow, even supreme court would
give in, in front of your excuses. These are not excuses, Zoya, I am telling you the truth. There are no two opinions about it. And it's true that you live in your
dad's house, you work for his business. And looks like you only
follow what he tells you to. And only he will tell you how many marriages
you are supposed to have, how to treat whom,
how to make her happy. You don't have any decisions of your own. Zoya, whatever I do, I do in dad's respect. And I would expect you also that
being my wife you respect him too. I do respect him, Zaid. But you know what the problem is? I am not dependent on him. That's why I won't give
the control of my life in his hands. And as far as you and
your problem is concerned, I have a solution for that. Leave Aima and your dad's house. Zaid, I will talk to mom, she will arrange
for your job and house, everything. Are you serious, Zoya? What
the hell are you talking about? I knew it that you won't
like this option either. You know why, Zaid? Because you are a weak person. You can't take your own decisions. And the decisions you are unable
to take you blame it on your dad. Actually, you know what?
You are happy here. I just have one regret, Zaid.
That I loved a person like you. You are a coward. You stay with them. I won't stay. -Greetings, Mom.
-Greetings. -My son is looking so nice, where are you headed?
-Thanks. I has to meet a friend, and as I was
home today so thought of meeting him. In fact that's the reason
why I took the day off. Very good, you know meeting
friends releases stress too. Yeah, that's true. Tell me one thing, I have been noticing for a few days
that you don't take Nosheen any where. What do you mean? Where? For shopping or for eating out. Mom, I had spoiled her in the beginning when
I used to take her out every now and then. Let her get back to her senses now. Very bad, Faiq. She is your wife. And it's your duty to make her happy. I know, but the truth is
that she doesn't deserve it. No matter how much I do,
it's never enough for her. To adjust just the girl
doesn't need to make efforts only. In fact the boy and his
family need to adjust too. If any one of them gets stubborn
then the relationship doesn't last. Mom, I try my best but she is
a quarrelsome and ill mannered girl. When you had made this
decision I had an idea even then that you are going to face
a lot of problems in future. Because this glitz and glam doesn't
keep one attracted for much longer. In the end the only girl who is
likeable is the one who has got skills. Mom, let bygones be bygones. I am saying all this to you because be this girl quarrelsome,
ill-mannered or unskilled, you will have to spend
your life with her now. I don't know how am I going to spend it. Wow, what a way to explain your son. I am really impressed. Everyone should have
a mother in law like you. You are fueling up your
son and then telling him that he will have to
spend his life with me? Oh, sorry, I think I disturbed you guys. Anyway, I'm going to mama's house. You aren't going anywhere. Stay home. Don't know what is it there
that you go there everyday. Faiq. -You may go.
-But I am telling her not to. No need to go anywhere. Mom,
is alone at home, stay with her. No need to worry about me. Let her go, Well, it's not like she is chatting
and enjoying with me all day. That she will get lonely at home. Look no need to talk back to me. It's because
of mom that you are getting permission. Faiq, you are leaving, so why don't
you drop her to her mother’s place. Sorry, mother, I have to
pick my friend on my way. You may rent a cab or ask
your mom to send the driver. Please don't worry about how I
am going to go. I can manage. And by the way where are
you going all dressed up? Are you going to get married again? Just stop this nonsense, understood? What's wrong? I was just kidding. Aren't we even allowed
to joke in this house? One can expect only
such cheap jokes from you. Enough both of you. And you can go wherever Are you serious, Zoya? What
the hell are you talking about? I knew it that you won't
like this option either. You know why, Zaid? Because you are a weak person. You can't take your own decisions. And the decisions you are unable
to take you blame it on your dad. Actually, you know what?
You are happy here.  First tell me where have you been? when we moved here from Norway,
you used to attend my calls. And then you got married and after that
you were just vanished. No contact. What can I say? My life has been
really difficult from past few years. Why what happened? Well, the experience of
getting married didn't go well. Oh, really? We had issues since the beginning. He used to stay idle at home all
day. We had quarrels on every thing. Then I came to know that he takes drugs. And then it got to the point
where he started hitting me. Well, how did your family
got you married to that guy? Didn't they do any investigation first? Everything seems really
nice from a distance, Faiq. He was well educated and quite rich too. You know what the parents of a girl want. You are right about that. But the good thing is that I am
not in that relationship anymore. Oh, that's great. I was under depression after that, but then
I left for Germany for further studies. I did my PhD and now
I am back to Pakistan. By the way, it's so strange, everyone wants to leave this place
and you left everything and got back here. Well I am at peace only here.
Everything seemed so fake abroad. So true. After all you also came leaving
everything behind in Norway. Yeah, I think we both
have similar motivation. Yeah, right. What else, how is life? Well, just like a married man's life is. -Really? And how is a married man's life?
-Boring. Oh come on, you men are such drama queens. Just a minute. Oh, it's my wife. So, pick it up. No it mustn't be anything
important, I know. -How can you be so sure?
-Because I get around 50 calls in a day. From which 25 are of my wife's and
25 are of my restaurant’s manager. By the way you know
who I met at my restaurant? -Who?
-Make a guess. Miss Farzana! Oh! Miss Farzana, whom you guys
used to call Farzana the medical store. Yeah, the same. Really? How is she doing?
She must be quite aged now. She is fine, and no she isn't
aged, in fact she got really fit. Anyway, it's really nice meeting
you after such a long time. Same here, and now please
stay in touch. No excuses like I'm too busy and
then you vanish again. Of course not, and you do the same, okay? -Come let's take a selfie till the food arrives.
-Yeah sure. Anyway, tell me what was the surprise
for which you came to my home? Wow, you remembered it so soon. Just tell me now. Looks like you have gotten
back to your senses now. Mama, will you tell me now or
just keep saying random things? -I came to give you both some money.
-Money? Well I'm not like Amber
who is aware of everything and made all the arrangements herself. That's why I brought some
money for your honey moon, so that you both can decide
what to do and where to go. Really? But Faiq didn't tell me that. Are you both still mad at each other? I don't know. I am not talking
to him properly these days. Nosheen, when will
you stop being childish? Anyway, come to the real topic. What happened then?
Didn't Faiq take money from you? Not at all. He just backed off and said me rudely
what do you think I don't have any money? What? He returned me the envelope
and started to confront me. I tried to tell him that it is a gift
and you should keep it as a gift But then he started misbehaving. All this is taught to him by that old lady. Excuse me, Nosheen, but he seems
much more clever than your mother in law. He doesn't listen to anyone. By the way, Nosheen where
did you get yourself into? He was about to destroy that Aima's fate. and you came in between, just for nothing. Mama, how would have I known
that he would turn out to be like this. But don't you worry. Let the time come, I will
give both of them tough time. I would say just stay away from them. Anyway, how much money did you bring? It was 5,00,000/- Do one thing, give that money to me. I am going to take him
for the honeymoon for sure. I will give it to you but
don't force him too much. Tell me, is you mother in
law back to her senses yet? Oh, no, Mama. Today she was saying
bad things about me right in front of me. Really? Strange. Anyway, do you know that your
sister in law came to my home? Yeah, I sent her to talk to them. I thought they are relatives, if she talks to her she would start
using her brain, and get a little better. Mama! I feel like mourning on your wisdom. Now what? Don't you understand
such a small thing that even the friend of
an enemy is an enemy. Don't know what she might
have said to my sister in law. Nosheen, whatever one
does for you isn't enough. Now handle these mother and son yourself. This guy never picks up my call. Nosheen, when did you get back? It's been an hour since I
got back. You weren't home. Yes, I went to check up on
a patient in the neighbors. Well, do you see your son now? What happened? Did anything
happen between you two again? Anything can only happen
when he gets back home. What? Isn't Faiq back yet? No. He doesn't even
bother to answer my call now. Why are you talking like this?
He is your husband. Wow, even when it's your son's
fault you are still blaming me? I am not blaming you, dear. I am just telling you like a mother. Really? What is it? Try to talk sweetly. And you will see that
the world is going to be yours. Just leave it. Nothing effects your son. You are right, if he had any
effect, he wouldn't have married you. You should not keep so
many differences in your heart. And don't forget that you
both had a love marriage. Not me but maybe
your son has forgotten it. Then remind him that. All those nice things that
you said to each other. And make new memories. What memories shall I make with him?
Don't you know what he has done to my mama? What? What has he done? Don't you know? Mama came the other
day to send me and Faiq on honeymoon. And Faiq misbehaved with him so
much. Don't you know about that? I just don't understand what is
the problem between you two. I don't know what is it
that you both fight over. Some of it is because
of the fire that you ignited. Please don't mind, auntie,
but it was your wish that Aima and Faiq get married, 
but he got married to me. That was my wish only. Besides what does
my wish has to do with your relationship? It has to do with our relationship. Faiq thinks that by marrying
me he has hurt his mom. And he is behaving this way because
he think he has done wrong to you. It's nothing like that, Nosheen. Okay then how is it, you tell me? I always tell him to stay happy
with you and keep you happy too. I have heard it from my own ears now. Weren't you telling Faiq that
I am ill mannered, an idler, and now you will have to
spend your life with Nosheen. What happened? Didn't you say that? Therefore don't pretend
to be nice in front of me. Believe me, I just wish
that my children stay happy. You both sort your differences
and spend life happily together. Okay, I believe you. Faiq answer my call. Madam has asked you to stay here,
she will come and talk to you herself. -You took a while to come.
-Auntie, I wanted to come. Why didn't you come then? Auntie, I know that you
guys a re angry with me. Please don't call me auntie. Not with your mouth at least. I'm, I'm sorry, auntie. Sorry? that's it? If I slit your throat and then
say sorry, would it be okay? Zaid you loved my
daughter so much, didn't you? You married her and took her from
here, with so much begging, pride and love. What have you done then? Why did you do this to my daughter? Auntie, I'm really sorry. That's not enough, Zaid. Auntie, please try to understand. 
I had to do this. Oh! I haven't seen such an obedient son ever. But you are a looser husband in my eyes. I did a huge mistake by
getting Zoya married to you. -Auntie please, I need to talk to Zoya.
-Out of question. You will answer me before Zoya. Look, please, call Zoya. No, Zaid, she won't talk to you. She is my wife, I have
full right to talk to her. Oh, so now you remember your rights? And duties? What about your duties? Go away from here. I think it would be better that
you let me meet with Zoya. No, Zaid, you have
already hurt her too much. I was thinking of going to lunch
tomorrow after our presentation. No, I won't be coming to office tomorrow. Aima, is everything all right? I tried to talk sweetly with
your son on your advice. Then? Then what? He thinks
of himself as something. He is so proud. -Rather do one thing. You want money?
-Yeah. Then go and jump off a roof. I promise I will pay for your shroud. 
You won't die like you don't have anyone. Just try and die once. Well, I am not going to die so easily. And if I die, I will cause 
many others to die with me. What do you mean? You are wise enough to
understand what I'm saying. You will get fever. Wear this. You are just... Oh, I'm so sorry guys. 
I didn't want to disturb you both. No, Zoya, it's nothing like
what you think, we were just... talking. It is like that, Zaid. Besides there
was such a nice romance going on and I spoiled it for no reason.
