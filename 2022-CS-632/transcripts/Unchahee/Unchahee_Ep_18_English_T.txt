[0.02] From flowers and from buds
[4.34] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.16] When I saw you
[13.89] I learned how to chirp from you
[20.11] This is such an old house.
[24.46] Doesn't seem like someone
has been living here.
[27.16] When one goes out for shopping,
it takes a while at times.
[32.36] What kind of shopping is this?
She has been gone before I woke up.
[37.77] She hasn't returned yet.
[39.59] You don't even know
when she gets out of the house.
[41.94] Is there a thing called shame in you?
[45.44] Who makes such a girl their honor
who has run off from her house.
[49.61] Is that how she thinks about me, Faisal?
You said your mother knew about us.
[57.84] Zaid, I'm not defending anyone here.
[61.54] I'm just saying
that it's not just Nosheen's fault.
[64.79] Right, right. So according to you
she should be given a medal on this, right?
[70.69] What is wrong with you?
[72.68] Zoya, why don't you understand that
me and dad look at the world differently.
[77.10] We just wanted to protect
a girl of our house.
[79.48] We know the difference between
a noble man and a scoundrel.
[83.27] Which you guys don't know.
[84.84] And hand Nosheen chosen a noble guy,
what issue would dad have with it?
[88.97] Just think about it.
[92.90] but the truth is that
this is Nosheen's character.
[98.57] And she is proven it too, now.
[106.19] I was thinking to look
for Faisal on social media.
[111.69] And what would this do?
[116.02] He might have uploaded some picture,
he might have checked in somewhere.
[119.07] We might get to know where he is.
[124.28] But how are we going to get his ID?
[128.57] I'll just stalk Nosheen's profile,
I might find something from there.
[136.99] All right, give it a try,
I'll try to find out myself too.
[174.02] Dad.
[176.61] Can I sit here with you?
[191.16] I completely understand your agony, Dad.
[197.39] I know you are in too much pain.
[201.54] First I created problems for you
and now Nosheen.
[205.74] Why are you apologetic
about that incident, Aima,
[208.84] which was not even your fault?
[210.91] I made a mistake after all, Dad.
[215.21] I know,
[217.76] you have never bothered me
intentionally, Aima.
[222.06] You have been very upset
in the past few days
[228.15] First because of me, then
mother's health, and now such a huge shock.
[234.60] Well difficulties are a part of life, dear.
[237.22] Yes, Dad, and their solutions too.
[242.62] Just don't worry.
God will make everything all right..
[247.85] And you'll see that Nosheen
will be back. She is our blood.
[253.50] I'm sure she won't repeat any mistake now.
[257.64] She will return to us eventually.
[260.12] I don't care about her anymore.
[264.15] No matter if she lives or dies,
her liveliness is useless for me.
[270.71] No matter how she lives,
[273.54] I am not bothered about it.
[277.44] I can understand your emotions, Dad.
[280.37] A father who works so hard to fulfill
even the smallest desires of his children,
[286.93] he can't give up this easily.
[291.70] He can't lose hope on them like this.
[294.68] Children are parents' hope.
[298.53] And they diminish that hope themselves.
[302.52] This sorrow is no less
than the sorrow of death.
[306.58] Where having a child is a blessing,
it's a test along with it too.
[314.56] You are right, Dad. God tests people by
giving some people and by not giving some.
[323.19] And at times, He gives someone
and then takes it back to test them.
[327.51] Yes.
[331.08] He is definitely testing me
and I have failed this test.
[335.59] Please, Dad, I know you very well.
You are not someone who fails.
[343.54] Please, please just don't lose courage.
[347.37] A lot of people have
many expectations from you.
[353.54] You're with me, aren't you?
[356.95] Then I can never give up.
[361.48] Would you do one thing then?
[365.30] -What is it?
-You haven't eaten anything since morning,
[368.20] -Please have something.
-Okay.
[371.98] Get the food ready, I'm coming.
[376.26] Okay.
[379.51] Listen.
[382.95] I love you, dear.
[385.24] -I love you too, Dad.
-Bless you.
[423.73] Faisal, where were you for so long?
[426.09] I've been waiting for you.
[429.35] You? Who are you
and what are you doing here?
[434.58] Don't be scared.
I live here, this is my house.
[438.53] Are you Faisal's friend?
[441.42] -Where is Faisal?
-I don't know.
[443.84] -Call him then.
-I don't have any credit in my phone.
[448.09] You are lying, right?
[450.32] I said call Faisal right now.
[453.62] Listen girl, he will come when he has to.
[457.70] I don't know, call Faisal right now
or let me talk to him over the phone.
[463.10] What did I say? Lower your tone.
Don't you get it?
[468.22] I won't, what are you going to do?
[470.72] To hell with you guys,
do you think I'm mad?
[473.43] Look, if you misbehave again,
you will have to face consequences.
[477.93] You should be thankful that even after
this behavior your dignity is still intact.
[482.94] Just let me talk to Faisal once.
[487.02] -No.
-Okay then tell me when Faisal will be back.
[492.92] I don't think he will return now.
[494.55] If he had to come he would have by now.
[496.70] It's better that you look
for a new place for yourself.
[500.31] Just listen to me, please.
[504.34] Don't bother me anymore.
[506.46] I'm not your servant
that I keep answering you.
[509.33] Go and sleep.
[523.81] Mom, what's will happen next?
[530.23] I don't understand myself.
[533.38] Sister has cried her eyes out there,
[538.09] and brother Azmat hasn't come once
to check up on her.
[544.41] Zaid was really disturbed too.
[548.29] Obviously, it's such a disturbing thing but
[552.73] everyone there is sitting
in their rooms by themselves.
[558.57] Problems aren't solved this way
[560.91] until you sit together
and discuss about it.
[565.64] You're right, Mom.
They are such a strange family.
[569.51] They just don't connect together.
[571.66] And then that madam, she did such a thing
that what was left is over now.
[578.60] -You're right.
-Just stay away from all this issue, okay?
[584.49] What do you mean?
[587.40] Means, don't try to advise too much.
[591.50] Our job is to console them only,
[593.81] the rest is their private matter.
[597.63] Mom, I keep my distance with them
[599.65] and what if they blame us
for something tomorrow.
[604.72] Besides, it's their personal matter.
[608.75] And because of uncle
I maintain my distance with them.
[615.41] That's a very good thing
that you keep your distance.
[619.13] Oh, I forgot in all this,
I wanted to tell you something.
[624.93] Mrs. Rashid has invited us friends
 tomorrow evening at her place.
[629.42] -Who?
-She is a lady who live nearby.
[633.74] Her house is in front of the park.
[635.65] I think you must have seen it. That house
is the most beautiful one in that area.
[641.95] Did you find about Faisal?
[645.12] -Yes, he has left for Dubai.
-Dubai?
[649.11] What's this nonsense? This can't be true.
[652.86] Look, one thing is clear
that he won't return now
[655.96] It's better that you pack
your bags and leave.
[658.85] Me? Where should I go?
[663.12] I don't know that.
[664.97] But it's not right for you to live with me.
[667.66] Why did I become unwanted
[672.27] Nobody knows that
[676.93] Why did I become unwanted
[681.44] Nobody knows that
[686.63] She has invited all of us club members.
[689.79] And you must have found
some guy there, huh?
[694.01] Come on, Zoya, you are saying in a way
as if I am looking for a guy for myself.
[698.67] By the way, not a bad idea.
[702.04] Mom, I'm going to get
married eventually,
[705.08] so why don't you find
someone for yourself too.
[707.61] Not at all.
[709.24] When I didn't remarry after your dad
passed away, why would I do it now.
[713.94] Mom, that's all right, but
[717.80] You will be alone when I will get married.
[720.31] So you should get married after me too.
[723.53] Okay. for now you tell me,
when are you getting married?
[730.46] In about 4-5 years.
[733.42] Four to five years? Really?
[736.07] Mom, I'm kidding.
[738.65] I'll get married, just wanted
to see how you'd react.
[746.88] By the way, on a serious note,
[749.51] if I leave tomorrow,
then you will be alone here.
[755.27] What are you going to do then?
[757.20] The same. I'll take care of my house
and my business, what else.
[761.49] But still, I won't be with you.
[764.94] You must feel so lonely.
[768.20] I am lonely right now too.
[770.25] Come on, Mom, you are saying
as if I don't spend time with you at all.
[775.05] Oh, I'm not complaining.
[777.55] I know you've got your studies,
friends' get togethers, parties.
[784.11] When you get time after all this
then we get a chance to talk.
[787.75] But still, Mom, at least I'm near you.
even if we don't talk that much.
[793.76] Yeah, that's true.
[797.64] But you changed the direction
of the conversation.
[800.31] I was telling you that Mrs. Rashid's son
is really handsome.
[803.88] Mom, please don't say anything.
Every guy is just perfect for you.
[809.62] No, this one is actually one in a million.
[813.23] Every other guy is
one in a million for you.
[817.32] Will you let me finish first, please?
Just, listen, Zoya.
[822.29] -Mom, Iâ€™m listening carry on.
-No, first put your phone away.
[826.20] Keep talking, I'm listening.
[834.63] Faisal, what trouble have you put me into.
[838.15] You couldn't stand her for
a little while,
[840.28] imagine how have I been dealing
with her for the past two years.
[843.05] Well, you have minted money from her too.
[845.32] Now tell me how shall I get rid of her?
[847.67] Do one think, just scare her off.
[849.94] She isn't leaving, she is such a pain.
[853.09] She is after me that,
"Please let me talk to my Faisal."
[856.09] No way, that girl is just too clingy.
[859.02] She has been sucking my blood
like a lice don't know since when.
[861.41] Then tell me what should I tell her then?
[864.76] Tell her anything.
Tell her that I have left for Dubai.
[868.79] Wow, you have found
such an international excuse.
[872.42] Yes, she will be buy it
if we tell her about Dubai.
[875.98] Or else if she finds
out that I'm here,
[877.62] then she'll find me
and won't give up until I marry her.
[879.89] Well, why don't you marry her then?
We'll get to eat some biryani too.
[883.81] That's all what you can think of.
[886.13] Didn't I give you a 100,000/- rupees? And
another 25,000/- rupees for Aima's task.
[890.84] No have as much biryani
with it as you like.
[893.13] Well, haven't you embezzled 5 million
from her in just one stroke?
[898.62] I have taken such a big risk as well,
I deserve this much at least.
[902.65] And on thing is very clear,
[905.59] girls who can't be loyal to their parents
 how can be loyal to anyone else.
[908.95] You are right here.
[911.05] The girl has just
shattered her father's honor
[913.57] to spend her life with someone else.
[916.39] Now listen, start some proper business
with this money.
[920.16] Getting money from girls
like this is very risky.
[923.41] Well, this is a business too.
[925.67] Until there are such girls available who
are ready to sacrifice their parents' honor
[930.14] our business will keep running.
[931.70] That's true as well.
[933.20] Well, then send her away
as soon as possible.
[934.86] Where should I send her?
[936.84] She has nowhere to go now.
[939.82] She can go anywhere,
that's not our problem.
[942.58] And she ran off herself, we
didn't kidnap her. I have evidence.
[947.32] And get rid of her as
soon as possible
[949.47] or else she is going to
create trouble for you.
[952.61] Okay, fine. Let me tell her the news
about Dubai then.
[956.68] Okay, okay then, bye.
[969.07] Yes, Mr. Ishtiaque, I'm sorry.
[972.51] I really fell bad saying that to you,
but please,
[977.93] don't come tomorrow for the wedding.
[981.16] Not postponed, canceled.
[986.15] I regret to tell you that we have
to call off this wedding.
[989.10] No, no, we have no doubts
or complains from you.
[996.06] Just think of it as
this marriage wasn't meant to happen.
[1005.40] Your concern
is absolutely valid, Mr. Ishtiaque.
[1009.33] But please understand
that whatever is happening
[1011.38] is in the best interest of you and me.
[1016.55] The reason isn't worth
mentioning, but still
[1020.19] I'm telling you so that
you don't stay in doubt.
[1023.74] Actually, my daughter
is interested in someone else
[1028.29] and I wasn't aware of this fact.
[1030.99] Now, it would be wrong to get your son
married to her in such a situation.
[1038.91] I just request you that
[1042.59] to please keep my daughters secret,
I'll be obliged.
[1050.03] thank you, thanks a lot.
[1052.95] God bless your son.
[1084.76] Did you find about Faisal?
[1088.12] -Yes, he has left for Dubai.
-Dubai?
[1092.03] What nonsense? This can't be true.
[1095.86] Look, one thing is clear
that he won't return.
[1098.92] It's better that you pack your
bags and leave from here as well.
[1101.79] Me? Where should I go?
[1106.07] I don't know that.
[1107.86] But it's not right for your to stay here.
[1111.48] -What do you mean?
-You know very well what I mean.
[1115.50] Don't test my patience.
Pack your bags and leave.
[1120.88] Where shall I go, where shall I stay?
[1124.04] Go back to your home. Say sorry
to you father and stay at your house.
[1128.28] No, dad won't forgive me.
[1132.39] You should have thought about that earlier
[1134.90] when you risked your father's honor for
a stranger and ran off from your home.
[1139.43] I had no idea that Fai...
that scoundrel would do this to me.
[1144.65] Oh, God, what am I going to do,
where am I going to go?
[1148.55] With whatever you have done,
I see just one place suitable for you
[1152.62] -and that is a shelter home.
-A shelter home?
[1156.33] Yes, pack your bags and leave.
[1160.81] At least let me stay here tonight.
[1163.85] I'll leave in the morning.
[1168.92] Fine, pack your stuff.
[1172.16] When I get back in the morning
you should be gone by then.
[1175.41] I don't want to see here.
[1204.55] I have reached to the conclusion
[1205.88] that I am going to limit my
principles to myself only.
[1209.11] Kid these days want to do
everything with their own will.
[1213.64] They want to make their life
decisions with full authority as well.
[1219.25] This is how it is.
[1230.60] Tell me when are you
sending your family?
[1234.23] -Where?
-To my house with the proposal, you idiot.
[1237.64] Yes I'm going to send them soon, very soon.
[1241.64] In how many days? Tell me exact days.
[1245.39] When I have told you once
that I'll send them, then I will.
[1248.67] Don't persist on everything.
[1252.34] Why are you getting angry, Faisal?
[1386.39] You have returned my daughter to me.
[1390.01] Is Zaid bringing her home?
[1392.82] No need to celebrate.
She is not coming to this house.
[1396.86] What do you mean she is not coming here?
Azmat, it's her home.
[1400.56] No, no. This was her home.
[1403.51] But all doors are closed for her now.
[1405.96] Why did I become unwanted
[1410.40] Nobody knows that
[1415.26] Why did I become unwanted
[1419.86] Nobody knows that
[1435.88] Dad, try to understand. If I shouldn't
bring her home, where should I take her?
[1442.16] Dad, I have got no choice, try to understand.
[1446.23] Dad... Dad!
[1450.25] What happened, brother?
[1453.33] What do you think? 
What would have happened?
[1455.53] He refused, didn't he? I knew it.
[1459.42] It's not like you've won a battle
that they shall welcome you at home.
[1481.12] What happened? Why aren't
you saying anything? What is it?
[1486.88] Was it Zaid's call?
[1491.04] Did he find anything about Nosheen?
[1495.25] Congratulations, he has found your daughter .
[1499.13] Than, God. You have me my child back.
[1504.58] Zaid is bringing him home, right?
[1507.36] No need to celebrate. 
She is not coming back to this home.
[1511.49] What do you mean she isn't
coming home, it's her house, Azmat.
[1515.14] No, No, this was her house.
[1518.04] But all doors all closed for her now.
[1520.73] If you don't care about her, 
at least care about me.
[1526.18] How am I going to live without her, Azmat?
[1529.42] Please, whatever you do just
don't throw her out of the house.
[1534.78] I can't live without her, Azmat.
[1537.07] If you can't live then you can go 
with her too, nobody is going to stop you.
[1541.11] What are you saying, Azmat?
[1543.24] I promise you,
[1546.40] she won't do such a thing again.
[1548.94] You and your promises.
[1551.16] If you were trust worthy, we
wouldn't have to face such a situation.
[1557.36] But why am I telling you this?
It would make no difference to you.
[1562.40] Azmat, what pleasure
do you get by hurting me?
[1565.82] By distancing my children from me.
[1568.05] Whatever is happening to you
guys is because of your own deeds.
[1572.89] I have told once that she won't
come back to this house, and I mean it.
[1592.78] Brother, tell me where
are you going to take me?
[1595.63] Shut up and get in the car.
[1617.81] Please come in. I just
came back a while ago.
[1624.34] Please, sit down.
[1626.92] She seemed really tired 
so I sent her to get some sleep.
[1630.93] I guess she is asleep.
[1633.98] She was crying a lot.
[1635.65] Oh, God, I wish nothing bad 
has happened to her.
[1639.79] She has been away for so many days.
[1642.02] Sister, just think positive.
[1645.06] Nosheen isn't that silly that she...
[1647.65] Amber, I got no clue
what am I going to do with this girl.
[1652.57] Sister, you should be thankful 
that at least we have found her.
[1657.75] But what is going to happen next?
[1659.93] Her father isn't ready to take her back,
till when is she going to stay here, Amber?
[1664.40] The wound is fresh right now. 
It will heal with time.
[1669.19] Brother Azmat is going 
to let him back too, you'll see.
[1672.61] His wounds never heal.
[1675.05] Did the wound given 
by Hammad heal till date?
[1677.04] Or you can say that people 
around him don't let it heal.
[1683.02] I am really worried about it, Amber.
[1686.71] Don't worry, everything
is going to be fine.
[1688.93] I wish that happens.
[1690.61] Amber, I can't thank you enough.
[1694.61] Thank you so much.
[1697.01] -Oh, come on.
-No, really,
[1699.62] In such situations people 
don't support you usually.
[1702.46] You have obliged me by keeping her.
[1708.98] What are you talking about. No matter
how she is, after all she is my niece.
[1715.02] If she hadn't come to me 
where would have she gone?
[1719.09] Besides, she can live here
as long as she wants.
[1722.82] I will take care of her, don't worry.
[1725.10] Amber, you have rendered 
my full right of being my sister.
[1728.66] You'll see. Everything
is going to be fine.
[1731.25] Brother Azmat is going
to call her back home too.
[1733.57] God willing.
[1735.13] Just don't worry. In fact you
can stay here as well, if you like.
[1739.33] You will be at ease.
[1740.46] Azmat is going to mind that. He doesn't
even know that Nosheen is with you.
[1744.77] And you know about Azmat's temper.
[1747.72] Okay, whatever suits you.
[1750.44] But occasionally keep asking
brother Azmat to forgive Nosheen, okay?
[1757.41] She is his child after all.
He can't forget about Nosheen.
[1762.67] Every thing is going to be fine. 
Don't worry.
[1781.63] Thank God,
[1784.84] Nosheen is back home safe and sound.
[1789.70] God has saved her from any kind of mishap.
[1795.65] That is enough for me.
[1798.48] I don't care about anything else.
[1804.00] Did you talk to auntie?
[1810.70] -Why?
-I didn't feel like it.
[1814.02] She kept calling me but I didn't pick up.
[1818.34] Zaid why are you doing so? 
Auntie needs you.
[1822.73] She was calling you 
because she was worried.
[1826.43] I don't think so. Mama 
and Nosheen don't need anyone.
[1831.66] They have followed their will always.
[1833.99] I can understand about Nosheen,
but why are you mad at auntie?
[1838.13] Nobody takes such a huge step 
without anyone's support.
[1843.63] And mama has always supported Nosheen.
[1850.53] She never tried to discipline her,
neither she let anyone else do it.
[1854.23] And she kept doing 
one bad thing after another.
[1857.13] She was so proud on her daughter.
[1860.03] And today, her own daughter deceived
her and she couldn't do anything about it.
[1866.63] Look, whatever had to happen 
did happen. That's was the past.
[1871.31] We have to rectify our present.
[1873.60] No , Aima, if someone's past is tainted
then his future doesn't let go of it.
[1881.01] And looking at our past, 
I don't think anything would change.
[1886.15] Zaid please don't think so negatively.
[1889.03] Everything is going 
to be fine with God's will.
[1893.72] At times I think how selfish one gets,
[1897.58] that he is unable to think
properly due to his selfishness.
[1903.43] He doesn't even know what effect his wrong
decisions will have on people close to him.
[1911.03] That's because a human is bound to err.
[1915.91] No, Aima, there is a thin line 
between error and crime.
[1921.73] And the difference is 
that after one commits a mistake
[1925.10] he has a chance to return home.
[1930.03] What can I say?
[1932.32] I still think that God 
has been really kind to us
[1937.29] that she is back home safe and sound.
[1944.67] Tell me, how did you find her?
[1948.37] I thought a lot about where Faisal 
could have taken her.
[1953.69] And finally I thought of a place.
[1956.01] -Which one?
-The same place where he called you.
[1963.08] And that place isn't even his, 
it's his friends.
[1968.13] The guy Nosheen was going
to marry is such a scoundrel.
[1972.02] Zaid, didn't Faisal stop you
from taking Nosheen away?
[1978.85] And didn't Nosheen insist 
that she doesn't want to come?
[1984.10] No. In fact when I reached there Nosheen
was already about to leave from there.
[1990.10] And by seeing me, she hugged me
as if she is really happy to see me.
[1996.88] What happened then? Where did that guy go?
[2002.05] And why was Nosheen leaving from there?
[2005.58] I don't know.
[2010.71] If Nosheen got happy after seeing you
[2014.71] it means that that guy has defrauded her.
[2025.65] Why did I become unwanted
[2030.37] Nobody knows that
[2035.06] Why did I become unwanted
[2039.59] Nobody knows that
[2044.41] I need to go somewhere for
some work, so I'll need your car.
[2047.81] Can you please ask the driver?
[2051.44] This isn't possible 
because I'm going with the driver.
[2054.88] And mama is going to work in her car.
[2057.40] Will you talk to Azmat?
[2060.17] About what?
[2061.78] That he takes Nosheen back in.
[2064.64] He never refuses what you and Aima say.
[2069.12] Nosheen.
[2083.25] That girl has cheated us again, Amber.
