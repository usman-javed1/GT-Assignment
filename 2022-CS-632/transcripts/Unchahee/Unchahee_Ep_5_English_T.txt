[0.64] From flowers and from buds
[4.76] I have learnt to bloom and be fragrant
[9.08] When I saw you
[14.61] I learnt how to chirp from you
[18.80]  Brother, what if
 Aima has committed suicide?
[23.65] Just shut up, Nosheen. Can't you
say something nice for once.
[27.81] Just don't worry, sister.
 I'll go and ask her.
[31.81] Why would I worry?
[33.95] And if she does something silly,
then I'm telling you
[37.21] we shouldn't be blamed.
[42.79] -How is your friend doing?
-She is fine.
[48.40] If she she fine
what was all the drama about?
[52.64] What do you mean drama?
She actually passed out, Mom.
[59.56] You don't know how cunning such girls are.
[63.09] Mom, you stay here but you have the news
about everyone and that too false news.
[68.42] Okay so you are calling your aunt
a liar because of that girl?
[73.25] You know well that it's nothing like that,
aunt just exaggerates.
[77.65] Okay, fine. You get too
possessive about that girl.
[81.55] Mom, she has got a name, Aima.
[86.71] And I just have to best friends.
[89.06] Who should I get possessive
about if not them?
[93.69] Okay! No need to get so serious.
[99.55] You know, whenever you say something
bad about Aima, I feel bad.
[106.03] But you always talk about her like that.
[111.53] Mom, just don't do it.
[115.30] -Talk about something else.
-Okay, fine.
[119.06] Tell me, is there something going on
 between Aima and Zaid?
[123.97] -What do you mean? What's going on?
-I mean an affair?
[128.28] They are really good friends, Mom.
[130.71] Like me and Zaid.
What are you talking about.
[136.46] Oh come on, they wouldn't tell you.
[141.39] -They must be hiding it from you.
-Why would they hide  from me, Mom?
[145.63] I know each and everything about
them, and they know all my secrets.
[151.20] You know what, Mom? You
just pose that you are progressive,
[155.12] but like others
you are conservative too.
[159.02] Okay, fine, it just came
to my mind so I asked you.
[163.15] Mom, please don't talk too much with aunt.
[165.68] And if you want to talk to her
then please don't discuss Aima.
[172.13] Okay, let's talk about something else.
[175.29] You have got some proposals.
[177.94] -Not now, Mom.
-Huh? Hey...
[182.32] Zoya! I don't know why this girl
minds so much if I say something.
[215.23] What's wrong, Nosheen? Why are you
sitting like this? Everything all right?
[221.47]  I can sit the way I want.
[223.95] It's my house and my room. Why do you care?
[228.22] You got angry for no reason.
[230.56] We haven't talked for so many days,
so I thought of checking up on you.
[236.82] You are saying as if
 we used to talk everyday.
[242.01] Look, Nosheen, we are cousins.
[244.60] We live in the same house.
Why can't we be good friends then?
[249.41] Why? Do you want something from me?
[252.55] Not at all, why would I
 want anything from you.
[255.90] And you know it well that if I need
anything I ask it from mother or dad.
[263.23] Then why have you come here
 to become friends?
[266.99] Why? Can't we be friends?
[271.10] Aima, just stop bugging me, go from
here there is already an issue.
[276.25] What is it? Tell me.
[279.25] Since when have you become
so interested in my life?
[283.77] Look...
[287.09] Look, may be I can be
of any help to you, huh?
[292.58] You want to help me? Okay then, listen.
[296.12] The college is taking everyone to the
farm house, but I didn't get permission.
[302.37] So tell me, can you help me? Will you?
[305.32] Duh, going to help me.
[307.03] Look if you didn't get permission, then
there must be something good in it for you.
[312.76] Whatever our parents think for us...
[314.82] Madam, just don't give me a lecture, go
away, I don't want to be friends with you.
[320.00] Why not?
[321.26] Because you are really boring
and not my type either.
[326.73] What do you mean? I didn't get you.
[329.15] You attend every night party with brother
Zaid yourself, and then you preach me.
[334.80] -Nosheen, I...
-Aima, Ger lost.
[340.52] Just go.
[359.76] Did you ask the doctor what
was the reason she fainted?
[363.57] Sister, she didn't have her meals that day.
[367.32] That's why she fainted.
[370.18] Are you sure this was the only reason?
[374.10] Yes, what else could it be.
[376.94] I mean it can be that she
took some pills or anything.
[384.29] -Pills? What sort of pills?
-Oh come on.
[388.46] Don't people take sleeping
pills to commit suicide?
[395.53] God forbid, sister.
[398.40] Why would my Aima do that?
[401.80] One should asses the problem
 from every angle.
[406.74] And as far as why she did it,
[407.90] then you aren't a kid either.
You know well
[410.00]  to what extent people go
in the matter of love.
[418.51] Sister...
[422.40] Fear God.
[427.53] Aima discusses everything with me.
[431.98] Why would she do it?
[434.89] Look, you have a mother's point of you,
that's why you are getting angry at me.
[441.64] These are very bad times,
specially for girls.
[445.47] They are killing themselves,
running away from their homes,
[447.72] and God knows what not are they
doing without telling their parents.
[452.30] I keep listening to stories like these.
[453.86] If that's the case then it's my advice that
you should get her married right away.
[457.75] Thank you for your advice, sister.
[462.28] But it's nothing like that.
[465.34] Okay, I'll leave then.
[468.09] You may feel bad about what I just said, 
but I just said it for your betterment. Okay?
[473.76] Keep an eye on Aima.
[508.50] So, all good now?
[510.30] -Hmm? Yes.
-Thank God, you are okay with me now.
[515.13] Or else at one point 
I thought you will never talk to me.
[518.51] Me too.
[520.05] Aima, promise me you are never going
to be angry like this with me.
[523.54] First promise me that you
are never going to hurt me.
[526.97] Here I promise with my heart.
[531.65] I got really shocked, 
the way you behaved with me.
[539.89] I felt that you consider me as worthless.
[543.99] I know, I'm... I'm really sorry.
[548.59] I always thought that the way you
consider all my things as yours
[553.49] I had a right on everything of yours.
[556.27] Aima, not had, you have the right.
And you are always going to have it.
[563.61] Okay then, fine, I also promise that
I am never going to get angry with you.
[570.81] I'm such an idiot.
[572.69] I got flared up on such a petty issue, 
don't know what was I thinking.
[577.57] Well thank God that Mr. Zaid
 has an idea about it.
[586.43] Okay, now forget about this incident.
[590.31] Why should I forget it, I have come to tell
you who I was chatting with the other day.
[596.00] -With whom?
-The girl from section C, Kinza.
[603.94] Kinza Khan? She talked to you?
[607.45] Well, you can say 
we both have become quite close.
[614.19] Really? Close?
[617.49] How can I be more specific than this?
[621.45] Are... are you flirting with her?
[625.09] Oh, no, much more than flirt,
[627.23] our eyes and hearts have met.
[631.55] I have started an affair with her.
[637.59] Did you get it, miss Tube light?
[641.50] What? Aren't you shocked?
[646.16] -Zoya must have told you already, she...
-Huh? No...
[654.11] She hasn't told me anything.
[655.67] But there is a problem.
[660.37] -Aren't you going to ask me the reason?
-Yeah, what happened?
[665.98] Kinza is angry with me, because of you.
[670.62] Because of me?
[672.87] Well you were angry, so
while trying to appease you
[675.93]  I wasn't able to reply to her messages
or attend her calls.
[679.36] She got angry for no reason.
[681.91] But now, you are going to help me.
[683.94] -And I need your help in appeasing her.
-I...
[688.75] How can I help you?
[690.65] You are going to tell me what should 
I gift her, so that she gets happy with me.
[694.49] Because I really trust your choice.
[697.62] Zaid...
[701.98] are you serious about her?
[705.89] Very much. I think I am in love with her.
[714.33] Zaid and Kinza's pair, excellent.
 It's going to be fun.
[723.69] And you aren't that dumb,
[726.29] that you are going to tell anyone 
and mess with me.
[729.83] I am going to go in a while. Be ready.
[732.21] Why did I become unwanted
[736.73] {\an8}Nobody knows that
[741.44] Why did I become unwanted
[745.72] {\an8}Nobody knows that
[751.67] Even if I had said anything
else than farm house,
[754.07] dad wouldn't have allowed
me to stay over night.
[760.18] Cancel tonight's party.
We'll go on a dinner date someday.
[767.12] I know, Faisal, 
but please try to understand.
[771.03] I can't get out of the house.
[774.72] I know...
[777.50] I'd tell you if there is just one issue.
[780.53] There are so many issues.
[784.34] It's not about the keys.
[786.77] How am I going to get back?
[790.54] Faisal... Faisal, just listen to me.
[805.83] What's up Nosheen, everything okay?
[809.10] I'm sorry, I was a bit mad that day 
that's why I said all that to you.
[814.36] It's okay, doesn't matter.
[816.81] -So, do you want to be friends with me?
-Yes.
[823.57] But friendship is a very
sensitive relationship.
[829.47] -One has to trust the other.
-Yes that's really important.
[834.69] And if a friend asks for a favor, 
one has to give it as well.
[840.63] -Yes.
-So, we are have become friends now?
[846.41] -May be.
-Then prove your friendship and give me a favor.
[852.22] -What sort of favor?
-I am going to leave for the farm house in  while.
[857.96] -Are you mad?
-Shh.
[862.35] You won't have to do much.
[864.82] Just open the grill for me
 when I leave and get back.
[868.29] And I'll be back by 4:00 am.
[870.79] Nosheen, you have gone mad.
 I am not going to do anything like that.
[875.60] Look, you won't have any problem.
[880.29] Dad's sleeping, mom would be 
over the phone, and Zaid in his room.
[887.08] I  have locked the door of my room.
[890.05] So that everyone thinks that I'm inside.
What do you think of my plan?
[894.56] Nosheen, I am not doing it at all.
[898.53] You don't have the option to say no to me.
[910.88] And you aren't that silly that you
tell anyone about it and mess with me.
[916.99] I am leaving in a while. Be ready.
[921.61] Nosheen, listen to me.
[928.44] This girl has gone mad.
[949.02] This girl is going 
to get doomed herself and me as well.
[952.42] It's so late.
[956.24] Oh, God, what test have you put me through.
[960.25] I was just trying to do what dad asked.
[965.22] Aima, you are still up, everything okay?
[969.38] Yes, actually I couldn't sleep,
 so I thought I should walk a bit.
[973.48] If you were getting bored you should have
messaged me, I was getting bored too.
[977.55] You are still up?
[979.61] Oh, yes, those in love
aren't able to sleep.
[986.77] By the way, what are you so sad about?
[990.93] -What do you mean?
-Just look at your face.
[994.12] It's 2:30 at night 
and your face still shows 12:00.
[996.96] -I mean, is everything okay?
-Yeah, I just... couldn't sleep.
[1001.62] You... just stop bothering me,
 I am going to sleep now.
[1004.53] Okay listen, why don't we order pizza
 in midnight deal? Let's have it together.
[1009.70] Zaid, I have a headache, 
I'm going to sleep.
[1012.69] Okay, listen...
[1015.06] You know that if you have any sort of
problem, you can always share with me.
[1020.45] Yeah, I have got no problem. I am going.
[1026.15] Okay, good night.
[1030.34] Kinza... what the hell.
[1035.06] Call me.
[1039.66] -Okay, I'll go now.
-Just stay for a little while.
[1042.76] Faisal don't be insane.
[1044.30] Dad get's up for midnight prayers at times.
Just go from here now.
[1049.02] Just stay for a little longer.
[1074.35] Oh God, please save me. 
Don't know what's going to happen.
[1083.84] -You are up so early today, Nosheen?
-Yes I got up early.
[1090.45] Where is dad?
[1091.69] I have come to ask you that.
[1093.76] Don't know where he has gone this early in
the morning. He has never done that before.
[1097.37] -So haven't you met him since morning?
-No.
[1104.54] When did you get up? Did you see him go?
[1110.55] I am worried, where has he gone this
early without even having breakfast.
[1115.24] Why don't you cal him?
[1117.17] I did call, but he disconnected. 
What if there is a mishap at the factory.
[1126.17] You seem scared, you...
[1130.25] have you done anything stupid again?
[1135.28] I am asking you.
[1141.22] What have you done now?
[1144.54] First promise me, mother
that you are not going to scold me.
[1148.64] Tell me right away, or else I have
other ways to make you spill it out.
[1157.14] Nosheen!
[1160.29] I am asking you something.
[1166.37] Actually, mother...
[1169.77] -I went to the party last night, and... 
-And?
[1177.67] And dad saw me when I was getting back.
[1202.44] Mother...
[1205.65] How are you feeling now?
[1207.80] Thank God, I'm much better.
[1211.02] I really got worried last night, you know.
[1215.45] You are getting worried for no reason.
[1219.31] And you woke up brother 
for no reason either.
[1222.62] You know, how worried
he gets because of me.
[1228.87] It wasn't a small thing, mother.
[1233.44] Your BP got really high.
[1236.35] -Tell me, if anything happened to you then?
-Nothing is going to happen to me.
[1253.21] Mother...
[1256.90] What are you thinking?
[1259.93] Nothing.
[1269.91] I'm thinking that brother
 shouldn't have taken me to the hospital.
[1277.54] And hadn't seen Nosheen like that.
[1281.20] Mother, why are you feeling guilty?
[1283.94] It's Nosheen's fault. 
She shouldn't have done this.
[1290.66] You are right, she has crossed all limits.
[1294.03] Getting back with a guy alone 
at that hour of night.
[1298.73] Her attire.
[1304.24] Brother couldn't even look me in the eye.
[1308.50] Thank God that the guy left,
[1312.90] had he stayed, don't know 
what brother would have done to him.
[1320.61] Mother, did dad say anything to Nosheen?
[1325.67] What could he say? He just went quite.
[1330.15] He went in his room and locked himself up.
[1334.82] Nosheen entered the house later.
[1339.87] It's such a painful thing for a father.
[1345.96] I think I shouldn't do breakfast 
with brother today.
[1350.26] But mother he has been gone since morning.
[1352.52] After humiliating me in front 
of my father you ask what's wrong?
[1357.53] Look,whatever has happened 
with you I am sorry about it.
[1361.81] Why did I become unwanted
[1365.80] {\an8}Nobody knows that
[1371.03] Why did I become unwanted
[1375.73] {\an8}Nobody knows that
[1381.46] What?
[1385.56] Where has he gone this early?
[1387.74] I don't know, 
maybe he has told aunt about it.
[1396.54] May God have mercy.
[1399.79] Don't know what my brother
 must be going through right now.
[1402.93] Mother, what is dad going 
to do with Nosheen?
[1408.45] I have no idea.
[1412.81] But whatever he is going to do,
 he will do it for Nosheen's betterment.
[1422.90] May God guide Nosheen to the right path.
[1429.20] If someone else does 
such a thing, one can ignore it.
[1436.13] But Nosheen is my niece.
[1442.28] My own blood.
[1444.35] Now don't take so much stress, mother,
or else your BP is going to shoot again.
[1449.05] Come on, lie down and rest for a while.
 I'll go and get you some juice.
[1454.56] You just get worried for no reason.
[1477.08] Durrani, can't see anybody at home
where is everyone gone?
[1479.91] Sir has gone out, 
the rest of them are home.
[1483.86] -All right.
-Okay.
[1494.98] Did you have your breakfast?
[1498.66] No not yet.
[1503.18] Everyone is at home and still no one
was at the dining table for breakfast.
[1508.20] May be they don't feel like it right now.
[1511.66] -As you don't feel like having it.
-I'm going to have it in a while.
[1517.75] -Has something happened?
-No, what happened?
[1525.67] It's for the first time that everyone is
home and no one came for breakfast...
[1533.52] Are... are you hiding something from me?
[1537.09] No Zaid, why would 
I hide anything from you?
[1539.81] I know you since childhood, 
I can read your face.
[1542.74] And you are going to hide it from me?
[1545.24] Zaid, what is your problem.
[1547.21] That's the problem, that you aren't
telling me what the problem is.
[1551.15] -Yes, there is a problem.
-What?
[1556.81] I can' tell you right now,
 just go to the university.
[1559.42] What do you mean I should go, 
aren't you coming?
[1561.59] No, mother is not feeling well today
 so I am going to stay with her.
[1566.72] Is she really sick? If you say I can stay
home too because dad isn't home either.
[1570.88] No, she is fine, I'll take care of her.
[1572.90] Just go to university,
you are getting late.
[1575.87] -Okay, fine, but call me if you need me.
-Yeah, okay.
[1592.96] He disconnected again.
[1597.88] This silence is indicating
 that a storm is on it's way.
[1600.68] Nosheen, I don't know what curse
are we going to face this time.
[1606.52] Oh...
[1609.07] Neither you had done all this,
 nor we had to face this issue.
[1613.92] Mother, I said, I'm sorry.
[1618.64] And how would I have known that dad would
take aunt to the hospital yesterday night,
[1623.83] and he will get back at the time
 I was supposed to get back.
[1626.82] It's just my bad luck.
[1628.62] A person decides for his
luck himself, Nosheen,
[1630.97]  what were you
thinking when you left?
[1634.77] You went so blind after him
[1636.74] that you didn't realize how you
are going to get back home?
[1640.14] Who is going to open the door for you?
[1642.27] You should have told me, 
you should have called me after you left.
[1645.71] I am not that silly, Mother.
[1649.83] I had given Aima the task 
of opening the door for me.
[1653.69] Oh, God, what should I do
with you, you crazy girl!
[1659.07] You dug your own grave.
[1661.84] Why, Mother? She came
 to me yesterday to become friends.
[1665.92] So I thought of taking advantage.
[1670.56] I feel like slapping you hard 
for what you have done.
[1673.40] Why don't you just hit me then, you
have been scolding me for so long.
[1677.45] What should I do then? 
Praise you on what you did?
[1680.24] What did I do?
[1681.59] You can't differentiate
between you foe and friend, Nosheen.
[1685.52] You have made your enemy a witness.
[1690.64] You know, they both 
can never do good to us.
[1695.22] -Mother, I just thought that...
-Just shut up!
[1698.74] Now I understand what the matter is.
[1702.14] As soon as you left, Aima told her mother.
[1704.92] And she pretended to be
sick and found an excuse
[1706.94] so that Azmat can catch
you red handed, Nosheen.
[1709.90] Now I get it, Mother.
[1712.87] What is the use of getting it now, Nosheen?
[1716.13] They both have gotten you black listed
in front of your dad for all your life.
[1726.47] I won't spare this Aima.
[1740.92] You never miss any? Not even Asim's? Nice.
[1745.27] Let me know next time,
I'll arrange for passes. Done.
[1750.76] -Did you enjoy? Was it crowded?
-Yes.
[1752.93] -Had more fun on Fawad's concert.
-Oh, wait a second.
[1756.11] -Zoya, hi.
-Hi.
[1760.83] I'm getting very bored today 
because Aima hasn't come.
[1764.45] Yeah right, Aima hasn't come
 so you are getting bored?
[1766.97] Means, I've got no value?
[1769.52] It is what it is.
[1774.25] Okay, forget Aima, listen to me. 
There's a good news.
[1778.74] What?
[1780.38] -Kinza agreed.
-What?
[1784.36] -What for?
-She was angry with me.
[1787.47] I had to do a lot of effort,
 then she agreed.
[1790.66] Oh, wow, every other girl 
is getting angry with you these days.
[1795.18] I'm serious, Zoya.
[1798.19] -Zaid.
-Hmm?
[1799.83] Are you actually serious with that girl?
[1802.35] Yeah, why do you think
 that I can't fall in love with anyone?
[1805.22] I mean I can love too,
 and I am in love with Kinza.
[1810.64] Oh come on! Lover... I am in love.
[1813.26] She has started coming in my dreams too.
[1816.05] Zaid, you hardly know her since a few days
and you have fallen in love with her? Wow!
[1821.16] It doesn't matter if love is of eight days
or eight months, it's state doesn't changes.
[1829.04] Come on.
[1833.28] -Should I tell you something.
-Hmm?
[1836.36] That girl Kinza, I don't
like her, neither does Aima.
[1840.90] Which ever girl I like, you don't like her.
[1844.93] -You know what this means?
-What?
[1847.14] That you love me.
[1849.60] -I love you?
-You love me.
[1851.75] Got you, got you!
 This is the truth, you should agree.
[1856.27] Have you ever seen your
face in the mirror?
[1858.18] It's so nice, what's with the face?
 I mean it's fine.
[1865.55] -Isn't it?
-No.
[1869.59] Okay, tell me one thing.
[1872.89] If tomorrow, your girl, Kinza,
[1876.72] if she has an issue with our friendship of
us three, what are you going to do then?
[1881.67] If she has an issue with our
friendship, then I'm going to leave.
[1886.07] So, aren't you going to make her
understand, and just leave her?
[1890.19] No not her, I'm going to leave you two.
[1895.31] Such a cheap guy you are, very cheap. 
Come on go away.
[1899.40] Okay listen, let's go have some coffee.
[1902.94] -Hey...
-I don't want to... Zaid...
[1928.17] -Aren't you ashamed a bit?
-What's wrong, Nosheen?
[1931.80] After humiliating me in front of my
dad, you are asking what happened?
[1936.69] Look, whatever has happened with you,
 I am sorry about that.
[1943.32] But believe me, I have
nothing to do with it.
[1947.98] Really? Insolence despite your wrongdoing?
[1954.72] -What is my fault in it, Nosheen.
-Yeah right, I'm the one at fault here.
[1959.44] that I trusted a wolf in
sheep's clothing like you.
[1963.33] Look, I have been calling you all night
 but I couldn't get through.
[1968.16] Don't lie to me.
[1970.14] I must agree, you have made 
such a great plan to trap me.
[1975.43] What plan are you talking about, Nosheen?
[1977.82] I have been up all night, 
waiting for you, and you are...
[1982.88] Just stop this nonsense. I know very well
what you did while staying up all night.
[1991.59] I have heard there was a drama
created of getting sick to trap me?
[1997.51] What are you talking about? You know
about mother's condition very well.
[2001.61] I am telling the truth.
[2003.93] If she is so sick, 
why hasn't anything happened to her yet?
[2009.39] Mind you language, she is my mother.
[2012.24] Really? The thief scolds the police?
[2017.41] I am well aware of the plan you and
your mother had made to get me caught.
[2024.13] Look, you are misunderstanding me.
[2026.80] And secondly, my mother is your aunt.
You have got a blood relation with her.
[2033.15] To hell with such blood 
and such a relation.
[2041.71] Why did I become unwanted
[2046.29] {\an8}Nobody knows that
[2051.11] Why did I become unwanted
[2055.24] {\an8}Nobody knows that
[2060.68] Marrying someone with my own will is my
right and it's your responsibility...
[2066.43] I just stopped myself before hitting you
today, don't you dare say that again.
[2071.97] Or else I won't stop then, understand?
[2074.55] Have you ever asked Nosheen, where she
goes, when she goes and why she goes?
[2081.51] Zaid you were going to the university then,
[2084.02] I didn't want to spoil
your mood at that time.
[2088.13] I wouldn't have gotten mad
with anger after knowing it,
[2090.56] but at least I should know
what is going on in the house.
[2093.21] You know, Dad's anger is
valid if that's the case.
