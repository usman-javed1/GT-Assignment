From flowers and from buds I have learnt to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you I just don't understand
what Zaid saw in Kinza. Was she the only one to fall
 in love with? I detest her. Don't know what she saw in her. Zoya, I can't say
anything about this. You are allowing the proposals
coming through dad too and you have asked auntie
for my proposals as well. Boys can do whatever they want, and girls
should stay confined in the house? Don't you start this
useless argument with me. No, not so easily, brother.
Tell me, why are men so dual-faced? By the way, this teddy bear of yours
must belong to a really good family, that she is calling you at this
hour of this night. Just get lost, go, get out of my room. Hi, Kinza, how are you doing? No, it's nothing.
So what were we talking about? Yeah, right, tomorrow's plan. Good morning. Till when are
you not going to talk to me? Who is that? -Hello.
-Thank you for calling me. May I know who you are, and
why are you bothering me? That would be really nice if
we get to know each other. And I really don't intend to bother you. Excuse me? Where did you
get my number from? Getting a number is not a difficult job. If you really devoted
then it's easier to achieve your destiny. You seem like a really cheap person. I am not a bad guy, Aima.
I just want to be friends with you. Look, I don't want to
be friends with anyone. And please, stop bothering me. Or else
I am going to treat you really bad. Don't hang up, please.
Just listen to me first. I would like to meet you once, just once. Look mister, neither do I want to meet
you, nor I want to be friends with you. -So just stop teasing me.
-Aima, listen to me... I am going to block him right away. It's too late. -Greetings, aunt.
-Greetings, dear. -Bless you.
-I have brought your medicines. Bless you, son. Is everything all right? I thought
you went to university with Aima. No I had to take an off today, actually some guy's family
is coming to meet Nosheen. -Didn't you know about it?
-Know, I didn't. Brother must have forgotten to tell me. May she have a great life ahead. I told Aima that I will
drop her to the university. And she left without waking me up. I wonder, she never does like that. Exactly, that's what I was thinking. I don't know, she has been really weird
 since past few days. She says things that
don't make sense, and if I ask what it is wrong
she starts crying. It's just that,
she is a really sensitive girl. Her heart melts easily. I just wish that she doesn't
have to face any more problems, and if there is any problem,
then may God give that to me. What are you talking about, aunt?
Why would anyone hurt you or Aima? I don't have the answer to this "Why?". But... I don't know what pleasure
people get by hurting others. Don't worry, me and dad are there for you. And if God wills, we will never
let any problem near you. Bless you my son. That's what I expect from you. May God give you lots
and lots of happiness. -Amen.
-Amen. Okay, now you take rest,
I'm just going to go. All right, son. Look at him, I am finally
going to meet him. Meet who? -The date that mom has arranged.
-Oh, good luck. Oh, God! This is the same guy who
messaged me the other day. He has been messaging me since last night,
 I have just had it. -Who is it?
-I don't know who it is. What's he saying? He is saying that, " Meet me,
talk to me over the phone." "I like you" and what not. So, just block him. I have blocked him many times.
He calls again and says, "Do you think I have just one number?" Give me his number. Tell me. He must be some roadside.... -Take it easy, nothing is going to happen.
-Zoya, I am really worried. -Did you tell Zaid?
-No, why would I tell Zaid? He gets very emotional, and I don't want
to get him involved in this matter. Look, if he is from the university,
I will deal with him, okay? You just don't worry,
everything is going to be fine. His father was really sorry
 that he couldn't make it. But he had to attend an urgent meeting. No, there is nothing to be sorry about it. They sent you both, that is enough. And this shows
 that he is a man of principles. When are you getting done with your MBA? Uncle, it's expected
to end by the end of this year. Good, very good. Very nice, bless you, my child. -Please have something.
-Yes, sure. May God preserve you from evil eye. Thank you, thank you. Come, dear, have a seat. -Is she your only daughter?
-Yes, she is our only daughter. She has got brothers though. I mean she has got an elder brother. This means you have got just one son? Yes, a happy family with two kids only. Do you want more sugar, son? It's okay, it's okay. -So, Mr. Faizan. One spoon or two?
-Yes, that's enough. -One?
-Yes. Okay, so where do you see
yourself in five years? Actually I, I am planning to do some
IT courses along with dad's business. So that I can run my software house. My education... I have done my masters... -Why are you laughing?
-I'm... I'm so sorry. I was just playing a prank with you. It seems like you have come
to give a job interview. It's fine, it's nothing like that. In fact there is nothing wrong if you
ask me any question, that's your right. Why are you being so formal? How should I address you then? Well you can be a bit frank with me. -I mean, not too frank, right?
-Excuse me? -You can be informal with me.
-Okay, fine. Okay do one thing, why don't you
 hit once more? Where? Your dad is a bit relaxed after seeing you
cooperate with this proposal and all. Spend a little quality time with him, just talk to him showing love and... Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that Okay, tell me something about your past. What do... What do you want to know about my past? I mean about my school or college and all? No, idiot... I mean did you have
any girl friend in the past? -No I have never had a girl friend.
-Why? Didn't you like anyone? No, I like one. I liked a girl in
class eight. No one else than that. I'm talking about recent times. Haven't you had any girlfriend recently? I didn't have anyone. Yes there was a girl. She tried to approach me
 but I didn't give her any response. -Why?Don't you like girls?
-No, I mean... What? I mean, do you like guys? Don't tell me that you swing the other way. No, no, it's not like that.
I do like girls. And I really like your sense of humor. I like you too, all of you. Thanks, by the way
what did you like about me? You are very interesting,
and I enjoyed your company. Thank you, I really like you a lot. And you are a natural, very natural.
You are very simple, no pretense. -I think we are going to get along well.
-You mean, made for each other? I do. Please have something. -By the way, the tea is really good.
-I haven't made it. You haven't? Well whoever has made it,
made it really well. Oh, sorry, please take a plate. No need of that. Nosheen, oh, my God.
Weren't you ashamed at all? -How were you ogling at that guy?
-I was ogling the way one is suppose to ogle. I wasn't aware of the level
of your mischievousness. Oh, come on. I had to do something.
What if they said they like me? Dad is ready as it is, so I
thought I must do something. Nosheen, no one can compete
your cunningness,  and you are getting even more
mischievous staying at home. Mother, I'm sure you must be
a firecracker like me in your youth. Nosheen, how are you talking to me?
I'm your mother! Well, I'm right. Daughters
take after their mothers. Stop it, Nosheen. Okay do one thing, why don't you
hit another shot? Where? Your dad is a bit relaxed after seeing you
cooperate with this proposal and all.  Spend a little quality time with him, just talk to him showing love,
and talk about some sensible things. Come on, Mother, I can't act. I am telling you this for your own benefit, may be this way your restrictions
are reduced as well. Okay, I'll think about it. Anything else? Okay, and do one thing after that,
apologize to your aunt as well. Apologize her for what?
I am not a walking apology letter. Excuse me , Nosheen. The scene that you
created the other day, apologize for that. Didn't you see what your sister does? She keeps recommending
proposals all the time. She has got proposals for the whole
world, but what about her own daughter? A walking matrimonial website. Nosheen, I can't win an argument
with you, okay? What kind of words are you
using for your aunt, Nosheen? Is that how you talk to elders? Oh, really? When I talk like that with my
paternal aunt then you have no issues. And you have told me yourself
to talk to you paternal aunt like this. Isn't she an elder too? Nosheen, nobody can stop you talking. Listen to me, Mother. From now on I am not only going to
reply rudely to my paternal aunt, but to everyone who messes with me. What the hell did you do today? -What's your problem, Zaid?
-I don't know, you tell me. Zaid I really don't have
much time right now. I have to prepare for my presentation,
so please go away from here. -It's a ten-marks presentation. Just chill.
-Ten marks matter to me a lot too. All right, just tell me when I told you that I am going to drop you to the
university, why didn't you wake me up? I called you a dozen times, but
you were sleeping like a log. Firstly, I don't sleep like a log. And secondly you know that
I don't attend calls. I tried to come to your room and wake you
up, but there was a password on your door. -Password?
-It was locked. Oh, sh**. So, sorry. Nosheen came last night,
so because of that... Okay now go from here,
I have to prepare for my presentation. Do it in front of me. I'll be the audience. Zaid, you know that I prepare
my presentation in front of the mirror. So, please go from here. Come on, do it. Besides
I am getting bored. Zaid, have you seen you eyes?
Oh, my God! You have got dark circles. Come on, go now and sleep on time. Well, this is how lovers are identified. What's wrong? Who was calling? Actually, the group with which I am working
on my presentation, they were calling. My teacher is so weird,
what group has he made. We three were such a nice group, perfect. Zaid, are you leaving or not? Okay, do your assignment. I'm leaving. Yes, Mr. Khalid, It's okay if you couldn't make it, you
sent you wife and son, that was fine. We will keep meeting in future. It's all right. Okay, I'll talk to you
later then, thank you, thank you. Yes? Everything all right? -Dad, actually...
-What? Dad, I have come to apologize to you. -Apologize?
-And to spend some time with you. Dad, I have started looking
at things from your point of view. Well, I am really happy to see that you are talking so sensibly. Today, in front of the family
that came, I am assured -that whatever you do is for my betterment.
-I am happy to know that. -But, Dad, I have a complain too.
-What complain? You don't believe me or mother, but I want to tell you
something about Aima. About Aima? What is it?
What do you want to tell? Dad, since I have been staying at home, Aima's behaviour has been
really rude with me. -Has Aima misbehaved with you?
-Yes, Dad. I was feeling really weak since yesterday. There was a glass of juice in the kitchen.
I drank it so that I don't faint. -So?
-Aima started shouting at me. She told me that I should make it myself. Dad, I told her that we stay in the
same house, we can share things. So, do you know what she replied? She said we live in the same house,
but we aren't the same family. Until I speak to Aima about it,
I can't say anything. Yes, Dad, I can understand. Dad, Aima is so shrewd that she always
pretend to be naive in front of you. Actually, Dad, I want to talk
 to you about something else too. Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that What should I do? Should I call Zoya? No, this is your issue, Aima,
and you are going to handle it yourself. You won't give up, will you? What do you think of yourself? Who are you? Who the hell are you
that I would get angry with you. Bloody low life, loser. Zoya. Yes, Mom? -You didn't tell me how your meeting went.
-It went well. -So, how is the guy?
-He is nice too. That's really great that you liked the guy. Shall I invite his family then? Wait a second.
When did I said that I like the guy. You just told me that you like the guy. Yes, that's true, the guy is nice. Then the next step is that
the elders sit together, and discuss the future plans. Mom, I said the guy is good.
I didn't say that he is good for me. -What's the difference between these two?
-There is a lot of difference, Mom. I mean he is a very naive, simple kind,
you know pampered kind of a guy? But he is not my type. Well, isn't that a good thing?
 He will be under your control. Mom, please don't say such typical things, and what do you mean he
will stay under control? I am going to get married,
not buy a puppet. Oh, Zoya you have a weird logic. Mom, Zoya likes good guys, who have got
a spark in them, who have a personality. Well then you should say
 that you like scumbags. When did I say that? A guy has a certain personality, he is
presentable. He has a sense of humor. A guy who has all these qualities
 would be one in a million. Well, I am going to find him then, Mom. Why are you in a hurry? -Again this stubborn attitude.
-What do you mean? Well, this. After so much schooling
 you liked a guy, and now you are rejecting him as well. The same issue again,
thats why am I in a hurry. Mom, I have told you not to worry,
and I am serious about getting married. Zoya, think about it
one more time, my child. One doesn't find such a proposal easily. Mom, please, I understand that you want
me to get married as soon as possible, but that doesn't mean you are going
to get me married with anybody. Look, I would like to
explore my options first, and I am going to reach
a conclusion eventually. Well this means that you are
going to meet 30, 40 guys and then select someone to get married. Not a bad idea, Mommy. The more the options,
the better the decision. My university is going
to be over in a few months. So, I was thinking of doing
some courses on finance.  You know, I think they might help. Yes, that might be good. I am trying to join your office as soon
as possible. If it's okay with you. Why would I have an issue with it,
this is something to be happy about. Besides, I want myself
that you join the office. It's getting difficult for me to handle
all that work, I get tired. I am happy that you have gotten
serious about your life. Thank you, Dad. Dad, I... I want to talk to you
about something else too. Tell me, what is it? Don't you think that we are being
a little hasty in getting Nosheen married. Not at all. I think she should complete
her bachelors, at least. I mean, Dad, these aren't ancient times.
Getting education is very important. Just imagine if God forbid
there is any crisis tomorrow, then how is she going to survive
without education, without any skills. And when she isn't educated herself,
how is she going to raise her children? You think that I am the one who has
stopped Nosheen to get education? I am not a conservative man. I believe that girls have as much right
of getting an education, as guys do. I even want that Aima joins me
at office after completing her university. That would be really great, Dad. And as far as Nosheen is concerned, she has
stopped herself from getting educated. She is not interested in getting
into a university or in her studies. What if tomorrow she does something
which is impossible to rectify? That is why, according to me
 getting her married is the best decision. But still I am going to consider
your opinion, rethink about it. Actually I want to talk
to you about one more thing. Since a few days, mama's attitude
with aunt and Aima is really bad, and Aima is really
disturbed because of that. Really? Aima didn't tell me about it. When does she tell
anything to anyone, Dad. It was me who insisted so
much that she had to tell me. Moreover, following mother,
Nosheen has also adopted an inappropriate attitude with her. I have an idea about that, but still, I'll
look into it, how to handle this issue. But, Dad, please don't let mother
know that we had talked about it, or aunt or Aima have complained about it. Don't worry, I know what I have to do. You're getting late from the university,
look at the time. Yes, Dad. I'll leave now,
see you, if God wills. -Good bye.
-Good bye. -Greetings, aunt.
-Greetings, sit down, dear. -How are you doing?
-I am good, how are you feeling? I am much better by the grace of God. I had a few complains from you. You know well that I don't
hold anything to myself. -Is everything all right, dear?
-Aunt, You must know, a family came to meet me. Yes, Zaid told me. And still you didn't come to meet them? They must be thinking
that dad doesn't treat you well, that's why he hasn't
called you to meet them. Dear... I didn't come because I thought
you or sister would mind it. Well, it doesn't matter whether
 me and mother mind something or not. I think dad would have really felt bad
that you didn't care about his honor. It just didn't feel right to me,
going and sitting there. Okay, auntie, if you don't mind
 may I ask you something? -Sure, why not?
-Aima has reached the age of marriage as well. But she isn't getting any proposals. It's nothing like that, dear. Aima's paternal aunt 
has given her son's proposal for Aima. Why don't you take it seriously then? Nosheen, I didn't understand
 what you are trying to say. Auntie, I want to say that,
is Aima having an affair? No, it's nothing like that. The way you both are carefree 
about it, it seems that's true. that there is an affair going on. Look, Aima doesn't hide anything from me. Auntie, all mothers think that their daughters are like 
an open book in front of them. That's why all mothers keep praising
how pious their daughters are. But you can't even imagine
 what they do behind their mothers' back. Nosheen, please think before you talk. Besides, those are different kind of girls. Oh, auntie, you don't know. Girls get out of their homes, 
wearing scarves and stoles, and when they reach their
college or university, there is no sign of a scarf and stole. The one who doesn't get caught
 is the pious one. I am not accusing anyone, 
I was just saying like that. And by looking at Aima's silence
and carefree attitude, it just crossed my mind, 
so I thought I should ask you. All right, please rest now. I have got so much work to do, I'll leave. Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that Why did I become unwanted I have an idea that Almas and Nosheen
have adopted an unfair behaviour with you. Is that true? Your dear aunt, poisons
your dad against me. No, no, I haven't talked 
to brother about it at all. If you hadn't said anything, Azmat wouldn't have rebuked me
so much without any reason. The world might feel pity 
on your miserable face. But don't you dare show your
cunningness in front of me.
