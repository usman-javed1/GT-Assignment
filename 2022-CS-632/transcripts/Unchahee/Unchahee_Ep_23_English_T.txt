[0.00] From flowers and from buds
[4.57] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.16] When I saw you
[14.11] I learned how to chirp from you
[19.77] Don't worry, whatever happens
will happen for good.
[24.23] Okay, let's assume that I
tell you that I love you and
[30.23] want to marry you.
[35.35] I fear that
[37.73] sister is not going to accept Aima
as the daughter in law of this family.
[40.96] Don't worry. Almas has to accept
Aima as the daughter in law of this family.
[56.35] Zoya!
[59.01] I love you, Zoya. Will you marry me?
[73.88] Amber, since you have told me this news
[76.67] my heart is blooming with happiness.
[80.68] I so much wanted
that Zaid and Zoya get together.
[84.94] And God listened to me.
[88.65] And by liking Zoya, Zaid has
proven that he is truly my son.
[93.91] Amber why delay such a noble task.
[97.34] What do you mean?
[100.67] I mean that we are not going to
keep a very long engagement period.
[106.70] Both the kids have completed their studies.
[109.76] And Zaid is going to join office
with Azmat. So why delay it?
[116.10] Sister, Zoya is going to decide that.
[119.12] She is going to tell what she intends.
[121.54] Oh, Amber, I am sure Zoya
wants the same from inside.
[130.48] Besides, she is not going
to any stranger's house.
[133.32] She is going to go to her
aunt's house, so don't worry,
[137.27] I am going to take care of her
even more than you, Amber.
[141.70] Yes, aunty, I'm sure.
[144.66] If I could, I would take
away Zoya right now.
[150.26] But everything seems good
when it's done at it's time.
[153.35] I am at peace now, Amber.
[155.96] Earlier I always used to worry that my
Zaid might get inclined somewhere else.
[162.40] But now something else is revealed.
[165.74] Why, auntie?
[169.14] Did Zaid like someone else?
[172.78] No he didn't, but others tried their best.
[182.40] And I was also scared that he
might get trapped by that witch.
[190.24] Who exactly are we talking about?
[192.44] That Aima. She has
embezzled so many of our rights
[195.06] that I was afraid she might
take away my Zaid from me.
[198.93] Auntie, please think
about what you are saying.
[201.61] What are you saying?
[203.41] You are a kid. You are
not aware of these tricks.
[210.22] Sister, she doesn't know anything.
[217.60] You are right, Amber. She is too naive.
[220.51] Both the mother and daughter
have turned Zaid so much against me
[225.47] that he has shared this
thing with his dad, not me.
[229.23] With uncle?
[231.16] Yes, what was his reaction?
[234.75] He was even happier than me.
I was shocked, he was so happy.
[241.34] Anyways, if Zaid had told me his choice
[244.31] then I would have come properly.
Not just with sweet but other things too.
[249.23] But for now, I have brought sweet only.
[251.90] There is no need for that, in fact
there was no need of this even.
[255.59] All of this happens when
a proposal is given formally.
[258.62] It was needed. It's such a happy occasion.
[262.27] Amber, we are not just
going to be sisters.
[264.82] We are going to become each
other's children's mother in laws.
[268.08] Zoya, here have some sweet.
[270.22] And I am going to eat it with your hands.
[274.70] Here you go.
[285.51] -Have some.
-No, I'm on diet.
[321.46] Okay, let's assume that I
tell you that I love you and
[327.51] want to marry you.
[358.44] Mother is still thinking that Zaid and I...
[368.12] What should I do, oh, God!
[372.10] If I tell her she will be heart broken.
[377.62] She was so happy for me.
[382.12] I can't tell her that.
[386.58] I can't break her heart.
[398.94] I don't understand how
much long will Zoya take to decide?
[403.44] Don't know what she is going to say,
how would the family react to this news?
[410.05] Your choice and happiness
is the most important thing.
[415.19] You should not worry
about what others think.
[424.01] I was thinking that when
I'm going to propose her
[426.02] her reaction is going to be like yours.
[431.40] Which reaction?
[433.16] When we were practicing, at
least you took my proposal seriously.
[437.33] She started laughing, I mean seriously?
[442.34] It's not necessary that the way I
feel about you other's will do too.
[453.75] I mean to say that
[456.97] everybody has a different way of thinking.
[462.68] So, you don't worry,
she is going to say yes.
[468.44] But when?
[471.28] I think I am going to
be restless tonight as well.
[476.99] Zaid, stop torturing yourself.
[481.19] Have a little patience.
[482.82] I'm not torturing myself Zoya is doing it.
[498.30] Is it Zoya?
[501.30] Check it, pick it up, hurry up.
[511.03] -Hello Zoya, how are you?
-Speaker, speaker.
[518.92] Where are you right now?
[521.42] I... I'm in my room.
[524.76] Okay, tell me one thing,
Zaid isn't with you, is he?
[529.91] No, he must be in his room. Why what is it?
[534.58] No, I mean he isn't
anywhere near you, is he?
[538.98] -No, no.
-Oh, thank God.
[541.93] Listen, only you can solve my problem.
I'm badly stuck.
[548.92] Zoya, why are you getting worried?
You're so lucky.
[553.42] See, two boys at the same
time are willing to marry you .
[558.01] This isn't luck but confusion.
[560.68] And only you can save me from
this problem. You'll have to guide me.
[565.46] Aima, I don't even buy a
shirt without your opinion,
[568.62] and this is such
a huge decision of my life.
[571.69] Okay, relax, relax.
[575.57] Tell me what is your confusion?
[579.09] Actually... no, no, I can't tell
you this over the telephone.
[583.79] Just come to my place, okay.
And tell me what should I do?
[588.56] Okay, what I'll do is,
I'll come to your place tomorrow.
[592.33] Okay, please come. And listen,
don't tell Zaid about it, okay?
[599.50] All right, okay.
[601.75] Thank you, and see you tomorrow. Okay, bye.
[617.54] Aima, please convince her some how
to marry me. I'll do whatever you want.
[630.09] Zaid I don't want anything.
[634.89] If Zoya follows my advice,
she is going to say yes to you.
[647.61] Zoya!
[656.50] Dad, everything all right?
You called us at this hour?
[660.38] No nothing is all right.
[662.69] The things that are going on in this
house, how can everything be all right?
[667.35] -Why, Dad? What happened?
-You guys are going to tell me that.
[672.59] Tell me one thing, Zaid. Why did
you keep such a big thing from me?
[677.30] What are you talking about, Dad?
[680.66] You like a girl, and you have
hidden it from your elders.
[685.97] Why are you looking at her? Talk to me.
[689.87] Actually, Dad, what happened was...
[693.79] You don't need to worry.
[696.50] In fact you should be happy.
[700.63] I have no objection on
your choice. I'm really happy.
[705.39] Dad, seriously?
[707.54] What's wrong with that?
The girl is well known to us.
[712.22] Come, come. I was pulling your son's leg.
[717.56] You ought to do that in such matters.
[722.25] We thought of him as a kid, but he
has proven to be a hidden warrior.
[727.07] Before I started looking for girls for him,
he has made things easy for us himself.
[732.57] Yes, you should be happy.
He has solved your problem.
[738.34] Yes, I'm really happy. After all he
has chosen the girl of my choice.
[745.54] What can be better than this?
[747.33] If you are okay with this relationship,
then all the problems are solved.
[752.58] Of course why won't I be okay
with it, after all it's my son's choice.
[756.87] Well then let the celebrations begin
in this house as soon as possible.
[759.49] It's been so long that such a
happy occasion has arrived here.
[761.54] You just leave it to me.
[763.43] Where is Shabana, we should
share the good news with her too.
[766.28] I have called her, she
must be here any moment.
[770.46] Listen, can't you keep
anything to yourself?
[773.46] I haven't told anyone anything.
[776.21] I'm really happy that you have no
objection on Zaid and Zoya's marriage.
[780.20] Whose marriage?
[781.47] Zaid and Zoya's marriage.
[800.20] Brother, I don't understand, 
whatever sister said...
[807.40] Shabana don't you worry, please.
[809.76] Whatever has happened just
now was a misunderstanding.
[813.75] So trust me. I know that Zaid likes
Aima not Zoya, and Aima likes Zaid too.
[821.66] Did Zaid tell you himself?
[824.00] I have see Zaid
confessing his love to Aima.
[827.00] That's why I'm confident.
[830.41] Whatever I've said, I have
said it after because I know.
[833.87] At first, I just expressed what I wanted.
[837.26] And asked time for Zaid's consent.
[841.57] Zaid has made his choice. I'm satisfied.
[844.49] And I'm saying yes to you from my side.
[848.69] Aima is a very nice daughter.
[850.73] I'm sure she will prove herself to be
the best wife and daughter in law too.
[855.29] She has all the qualities
which complete a woman.
[859.51] She knows how to
make a home better.
[861.64] She has the sense of
taking care of her relations.
[864.40] If she becomes the
daughter in law of this house,
[865.90]  I'm going to be really proud of that.
[868.91] Yes, brother, I know it very
well how much you love Aima.
[875.76] -But...
-Don't start again.
[877.95] Let go of all your fears
and doubts, Shabana.
[880.03] When I'm telling you that Zaid and
Aima like each other, they love each other
[885.49] then end of discussion.
[889.20] I haven't misunderstood anything.
[891.69] Perhaps Almas is misunderstood something.
[895.81] That is why she took Zoya's name with Zaid.
[898.61] Maybe this is Amber's or her wish.
[902.71] But the reality can't be hidden
because of that because he likes Aima.
[907.89] Yes, brother, I wish that happened.
[912.35] Shabana, don't worry, have some patience
[916.38] Trust me.
[918.82] I am going to fulfill 
what I am promising this time.
[923.41] With God's will.
[939.16] -Zaid, you proved to be a hidden warrior.
-What do you mean, Mama?
[944.38] You have worked so secretly that you
didn't even let anybody know about it.
[951.03] One keeps what's in his heart to himself.
[955.34] To tell you the truth, I've always
been confused about your choice.
[961.01] I was confused myself, Mama.
[962.88] -What?
-Nothing, you tell me, what were you saying?
[966.39] At times I felt like you
were after Aima,
[969.16] and at times I felt like you were
bringing someone new to home.
[972.21] It's not like that, I'm not after anybody.
[974.30] But I don't know, with Zoya it
just felt right so I proposed her.
[979.26] That's the best thing you've done. There
is no better option than Zoya for you.
[985.04] Why? Because she is your niece?
[987.20] Obviously, but also because
she is someone's only daughter.
[993.21] No hassle with brothers and sisters in
law, and no new dramas every other day.
[1003.40] Look, when Zoya will come to
our place, we will be her only family.
[1009.56] And all her focus is going to be on us.
[1014.06] If that's the criteria then
Aima is the best in this regard
[1017.59] because even her home is this as well.
[1020.24] Stop talking about useless things.
[1022.46] I'm just replying to what you just said.
[1024.06] It's very beneficial if someone is an
only child, Zaid. Don't you know that?
[1027.65] -Really? How?
-Like the matters of inheritance.
[1032.90] Son, I'm really happy that you are
getting a daughter in law of my choice
[1036.95] and I'm happy about the fact that you have
taken a well thought decision about it.
[1043.47] I didn't think about it so much, Mama. 
It just occurred to me and I did it.
[1048.21] And honestly, I'm confused
myself if I should have done it or not.
[1052.08] Okay, now stop this nonsense.
[1057.23] We're happy and you
should be happy too, all right?
[1059.93] Yes, I'm happy.
[1061.01] In fact, mostly because of dad.
Because I wanted that dad gets happy.
[1066.00] All I wanted was that whatever decision I
take, dad should have no objection over it.
[1069.55] Okay, now just decide the dates for
wedding, because I can't wait anymore.
[1073.12] Mama, tell me one thing. You are
celebrating and distributing sweets,
[1077.25] has auntie told you that Zoya has agreed?
[1079.40] Oh, who would say no to my son?
[1083.66] Because her consent is
very important as well, Mama.
[1085.81] She asked me for some time to
let me know about her decision.
[1089.08] She needed some time to think,
and she hasn't answered me yet.
[1092.84] Oh come on. Taking time to
think all of it are dramas that girl do.
[1098.55] If she wanted to say no
she would have said it earlier.
[1101.59] Just think positive and
stop worrying, all right?
[1105.79] Well if you think that's how it is
then I should stay positive as well.
[1111.60] Exactly.
[1144.68] Zoya!
[1147.22] Zoya you can open your eyes now.
[1162.31] I love you, Zoya. Will you marry me?
[1173.60] Aima, what are you doing here all alone?
[1180.04] I came for a walk 
so just stopped for a while.
[1184.32] I like to look at the stars 
under the open sky.
[1189.42] Why don't you stay
here for a while with me?
[1197.01] What happened, mother?
[1201.75] Why are you worried?
[1203.89] What are you hiding from me?
[1206.07] No, I'm not worried.
[1209.53] And why would I hide anything from you?
[1215.73] I am observing you since many days.
[1225.27] I want to understand and ask from you
[1228.73] that what is it that is bothering you?
[1234.53] But whenever I tried to ask you avoided it.
[1239.10] What ever is going on in the house,
[1243.98] I can't understand what the truth is.
[1249.07] Don't worry, 
whatever is happening is right.
[1257.71] You're right. But, Aima...
[1266.21] tell me the truth.
[1269.46] Does Zaid like you?
[1273.98] Who told you that?
[1276.99] Zaid and me are good friends.
[1279.43] And Zaid likes Zoya.
[1285.84] And who do you like?
[1287.54] Mother, what's wrong with you? 
What are you talking about?
[1291.11] I have asked a question. Answer me.
[1294.51] Mother, I like Zaid just like a friend.
[1300.08] All right.
[1303.30] If that's the case
[1307.86] then why do you have tears in your
eyes when there marriage is fixed?
[1314.27] I don't know, I get emotional
on small things these days.
[1321.51] But if I'm crying it doesn't mean
at all that I am in love with Zaid.
[1329.14] -Shall I say one thing?
-Yes?
[1333.52] Dear,
[1337.21] I have been through
this age that you are in.
[1341.02] I am well aware of
the condition you are in.
[1344.92] Look, dear,
[1347.55] it isn't wrong to love someone.
[1350.66] It is human nature to love someone.
[1357.15] But dear, it is better that you
handover your choice to God.
[1366.84] Just accept his decisions.
[1370.77] Dear,
[1372.89] I always pray to God
[1377.33] that may God does what is better for you.
[1383.90] Even if you want it or not,
[1388.12] if it is in form of Zaid or someone else.
[1391.58] You are getting worried for no reason.
[1394.05] And I have no complains with God.
[1397.54] He must have written
something better for me.
[1402.37] My dear,
[1405.38] do you know,
[1408.52] you are my courage.
[1411.55] I get the courage to fight with
the situations when I look at you.
[1417.84] You are my strength.
[1421.98] You're my brave girl.
[1428.38] Because I have taken after you.
[1440.12] I had never thought that such 
a happy occasion will come so suddenly.
[1447.21] But along with that there
comes a responsibility as well.
[1450.09] We will have a daughter in law in our
house. A new family is going to be built.
[1455.24] Oh, I just... So much is going
on in my head, I just don't know...
[1460.03] And I don't understand if we
should directly get them engaged
[1465.05] or shall we decide 
a date and get them married.
[1468.52] And I am going to get 
the upper portion renovated.
[1472.48] What do you say?
[1474.55] We'll see.
[1476.22] What happened? 
What do you mean by we'll see?
[1480.84] We will have to decide now so that
we get the renovation started upstairs.
[1489.65] What's wrong with you? You were in
such a good mood and now you are not.
[1495.38] I have to talk to you 
about something very important.
[1497.47] Before you say something to me, 
I want to say something to you.
[1501.48] By being a part of Zaid
and Zoya's happiness
[1505.63] you have proven that
you have actually changed.
[1509.33] That is where peace is. Our happiness
lies with our children's happiness.
[1514.12] How have you decided it
yourself that Zaid likes Zoya.
[1518.27] what do you mean?
Aren't you happy about it?
[1521.94] You didn't answer me.
[1525.04] I don't understand what has
happened to you suddenly?
[1528.04]  You've just changed. What happened?
[1530.32] Forget about me, tell me who
told you that Zaid likes Zoya.
[1535.55] Who started all this?
[1537.63] To me it seems like a wish which
either Amber has expressed or you have.
[1543.49] Neither is it my wish nor Amber's. 
It's your son's wish.
[1549.76] You must have misunderstood
something for sure.
[1552.70] What do you mean, which misunderstanding?
[1554.49] Amber had called me to tell that Zaid has
proposed Zoya and he wants to marry her.
[1560.33] How can this be? It's just impossible.
[1563.68] What is impossible in that?
[1565.68] Both are cousins. They were friends
before and started liking each other.
[1569.51]  And now they want to marry each other.
[1571.38] What's there to be surprised about?
[1573.37] No, no, no.
[1575.42] I don't think that Zaid likes Zoya.
[1579.09] What difference does it make what you
think, the truth is in front of everyone.
[1584.23] Look, I'm telling you once again,
you must have some misunderstanding.
[1587.87] There has been no misunderstanding.
[1590.04] Have you talked to Zaid about it?
[1591.91] I am just coming from Zaid's room. Azmat,
he has told me exactly what Amber told me.
[1597.67] that he has proposed Zoya
for marriage.
[1601.07] So has he agreed that he likes Zoya?
[1604.11] Zaid has told me what Amber told me
[1607.22] that he has proposed Zoya
he wants to marry her.
[1612.61] And Zaid has proposed her
because he wants to marry her.
[1617.80] Why would you propose
someone if you don't like someone?
[1623.52] I don't understand why don't
you believe on what I'm saying.
[1629.32] -What is the problem?
-Problem...
[1636.51] There isn't any problem.
[1640.44] The problem is that
[1643.53] I'm sleepy.
[1684.31] What a joke. Both the homes have started
celebrations and madam is still not sure.
[1693.04] I know it, Zoya. I know
you're just messing with me.
[1697.40] You're playing with me.
[1734.27] Is the marriage fixed?
[1736.30] Consider it almost fixed.
[1738.81] Few things need to be
finalized and then a function.
[1742.27] And we are going to have a grand function.
[1746.52] I have told you such an exciting
news, Nosheen and you're not happy?
[1751.06] So what do you want? Shall I dance over it?
[1754.71] Nosheen, why do talk so
sarcastically and bitterly?
[1758.63] Sorry to say but I don't see any wisdom
behind this useless decision of yours.
[1765.31] And you're some genius
who knows what lies in future?
[1771.94] Look, Nosheen, if you
can't do anything else
[1774.35] then just shut up and just be
happy in your brother's happiness.
[1778.65] If he doesn't even consider me as his
sister, why should I celebrate his wedding?
[1783.52] Nosheen don't be
negative about everything.
[1787.18] You are bringing your niece in
this house and happy about it.
[1791.32] Yeah, why shouldn't I?
My sister's daughter
[1793.36] is becoming the daughter
in law of this family.
[1795.30] Mama, you are having false hopes.
[1799.86] Your sister's daughter is
going to create trouble for you.
[1802.95] You are going to face tough times.
[1804.78] I'm telling you, 
your daughter's sister is very cunning.
[1809.55] Don't get her married
to Zaid, I'm telling you.
[1812.61] It would be better that you
get him married to Aima.
[1815.26] At least she is going to be harmless.
[1817.91] And your sister has got such sharp nails
[1821.65] that she is going to
scratch the whole house.
[1823.96] Just stop this nonsense. You keep
uttering nonsense with your cursed tongue.
[1828.42] Say something nice for once, Nosheen.
[1831.32] A bitter truth is better
than a sweet lie, Mama.
[1834.81] And you know it, I don't lie.
[1838.50] Don't you know how that girl is? 
I have stayed with her.
[1841.74] She wasn't polite even at her home.
You should forget about it here then.
[1845.50] And I'm telling you, if she doesn't
make you cry in the first few days,
[1849.83]  you can change my name.
[1851.52] Don't come to me crying then.
[1856.97] Listen, you don't need to worry much.
[1859.98] I know it very well why
you are saying all this.
[1862.75] Oh, really? So you think I'm jealous of her
because she is getting married before I am?
[1869.51] What else.
[1870.90] Okay, fine, do as you like. 
I was talking about your benefit.
[1875.63] I don't need your help. I can
take care of my house, okay?
[1880.63] You weren't able to take
care of your house till date.
[1883.21] And what do I care?
I was just wandering you.
[1885.15] It's between you and your son now.
[1887.34] What do I have to do with
it. If not today then tomorrow
[1889.56] I am going to marry and
go away from this house.
[1892.18] Just pray that you get a proposal.
Because what you have done,
[1896.15] nobody makes such a girl
the honor of their home.
[1900.29] Wow, Mama, means you
have said it in hidden words
[1902.75] that you don't have any
hope of me getting married?
[1929.31] By the way, there are so many people
in the house who can poison his ears.
[1933.65] You do get what I'm saying, don't you?
[1937.18] What can I answer you about this?
[1940.93] Okay, just keep you stance on this matter.
[1944.43] Because if I get to know that
you are the one misleading him,
[1950.13] you're going to see then
what I am going to do, got it?
[1954.34] Where there is happiness coming to
this house, there is a little sadness too.
[1959.38] There is confusion and worries.
[1961.77] Regarding what, Dad?
[1963.66] Let me tell you. I want that
you both clear it yourselves
[1967.15] that you love each other
and want to marry each other.
