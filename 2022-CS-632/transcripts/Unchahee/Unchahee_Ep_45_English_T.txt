[0.00] From flowers and from buds
[4.54] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.13] When I saw you
[14.07] I learned how to chirp from you
[19.49] Who is calling you this late?
[22.56] Faiq, it's mama.
[27.38] Is this the time to call?
[29.73] Faiq, she is my mama. She worries
about me that's why she is calling.
[36.24] Nosheen I know what you are going through.
[40.24] Really? You must be really happy then.
[44.20] Why do you always think
that I'm your enemy?
[48.40] Because I know very well
whatever you are doing with me.
[51.75] I am not stupid.
[53.47] We have the contract ready with us. We'll
just have to print your name on it. What else.
[64.78] Sure just get the contract, I will sign it.
[81.62] You didn't let me down, son.
[85.16] And this means a lot to me.
[87.38] I'm talking about Aima.
[89.95] I can tell by looking 
at the joy on her face
[92.37] that you listened to
me and treated her well.
[130.12] Oh, wow, that's an achievement.
[132.34] So, when are you throwing a party?
[136.83] Come on, Sania, since when
have you been so formal?
[143.28] Of course, tell me when would you
want to meet. I can come even now.
[148.49] What difference does it make?
[149.98] And it's not like one doesn't have
any desires after getting married.
[151.90] Besides, I really like
flirting with pretty girls.
[157.91] All right then, we're
meeting at lunch tomorrow.
[160.58] Okay, hold on.
[164.86] Mom and me were waiting 
for you over dinner.
[170.58] Okay, you guys start, I'll join you.
[175.81] Ya, hello? No, nothing I just don't feel
like eating right now. I'll go in a while.
[180.66] Tell me what were we talking about?
[184.49] Yeah, so it's done. I'll be there.
[187.41] Done for sure, tomorrow afternoon.
[190.73] Okay.
[194.70] I told you.
[216.02] Sure, don't worry, I'll manage.
[220.64] Just tell me the date and time. 
I'll be there.
[224.15] No, I won't be late. I'll reach on time.
[228.34] Yeah, okay. Perfect.
[232.84] Okay, bye.
[241.16] Oh,
[244.31] I, I'm good, how about you?
[247.87] I'm perfectly fine.
[252.20] I landed yesterday evening, 
my flight was yesterday.
[255.34] Okay, you came yesterday?
[260.65] Yeah.
[263.56] Actually, I was too tired 
so I couldn't come yesterday.
[267.95] No, it's okay. Good that you took rest.
[271.30] What else? How was 
the weather there, how was your trip?
[275.00] Well, the weather was good,
[277.80] it's just that it started raining 
on the last day so our flight was canceled.
[281.33] So... otherwise you know I...
[287.62] -You're busy.
-No, I was just texting something important,
[291.83] just give me a minute.
[296.34] Zoya, by the way, did you see this?
[301.21] What's in there?
[302.64] There is a shawl and a
perfume which I liked a lot.
[305.21] I really liked the fragrance so I
thought why not take it for Zoya.
[307.94] I'm sorry it's not a big brand, 
but I hope you like it.
[311.94] Thank you, just keep it here somewhere.
[314.52] You know I don't use cheap perfumes.
[317.85] Give it to Aima, she uses them.
[328.28] Zoya,
[330.80] let's go home.
[333.73] -Right now?
-Of course, I have come to pick you up.
[338.12] Sorry, but I can't come with you right now.
[341.21] What do you mean?
[343.33] I have a meeting today.
[345.83] I'll come tomorrow, Zaid.
[348.38] May I know what meeting is it?
[352.49] Oh, yeah, I forgot to tell you.
[356.23] I have signed a contract with an agency.
[362.85] What kind of a contract?
[365.70] A modeling contract.
[367.40] I'll have to work for them for two years.
[370.28] It was a good deal so I
couldn't say no to them.
[374.35] But the contract is really good.
[381.13] What's wrong? Aren't you happy?
[385.83] No, good for you, congratulations.
[388.57] Thanks.
[391.91] I'll come tomorrow, Zain.
[396.33] Okay, then I'll leave.
[399.06] Have a cup of coffee, now that you're here.
[402.47] No, thank you, I don't feel like it.
[404.47] Listen, I forgot to discuss 
the main thing with you.
[409.68] I think you must have decided by
now who do you want to live  with.
[415.76] What do you mean?
[418.10] Look, Zaid, it's very simple.
[420.54] Just tell me who do you want
in your life. Aima or me?
[425.33] And if you can't leave Aima 
then you should divorce me.
[429.75] Because I can't handle
this tug of war anymore.
[449.20] Really? Oh, my God. Stop it Faiq,
I am having a laughing fit here.
[455.33] You look nice when you smile.
[457.07] Okay, now that's a compliment.
[461.56] I have heard that girls like compliments.
[464.57] Yeah, right actually.
[466.67] But I am not such a girl who gets
happy by listening to a compliment.
[469.89] Yes, but who doesn't like to be praised?
[472.46] That's also correct.
[474.19] I know, I'm always right.
[476.23] Oh, please, well it's not like that.
[479.37] It is like that, Sania.
[480.67] Well one must ask this question to
your wife. She must know the right answer.
[486.29] I fell that every husband 
has two personalities.
[489.83] Really? How come?
[491.96] One which is his actual one, and the other
that he pretends to be in front of his wife.
[497.38] OMG, that's so mean!
[500.21] -That's a fact.
-I just don't get one thing.
[503.84] What's that?
[504.89] Why can't you guys stay like
how you are in front of your wives?
[508.27] To tell you the truth,
you are quite comic yourself.
[511.13] -Shut up, Faiq.
-No, I'm serious.
[514.11] If you will say this in front of
any guy he is going to laugh.
[517.16] You guys are so culprit.
[519.02] Come on, we men are the most
innocent creatures of this world.
[523.64] Yeah, sure, do we have any
other option than believing on it?
[528.25] We didn't even order anything
because of your chattering.
[531.99] We'll grab something on our way back.
[533.74] So now you will blame 
even that on us girls?
[537.41] By the way, shall
I say something?
[539.48] Sure go ahead, say it if
there is anything else left to say.
[543.23] -No, seriously.
-Okay, go ahead.
[546.51] Sania, with you time passes so quickly.
[552.11] -And you know what the beauty is?
-What?
[555.35] -The time passes really well too.
-God, you have become so flirtatious.
[560.09] Excuse me, what do you mean I have become?
I was always like that.
[563.55] Yes, I am aware of that. But don't
forget that now you are a married man.
[567.88] Well, this is an
unforgettable incident, Sania.
[571.21] Come on, let's walk.
[593.18] What can I tell you, Shabana, my innocent
daughter is facing so much cruelty there.
[598.99] I just can't believe that Faiq
and sister Nimra can do all this.
[604.35] Do you think I'm lying then?
[606.98] No, if you are saying it 
then it must be true.
[614.06] Just have courage, don't cry.
[618.76] How can I not cry, Shabana?
[621.15] We have been so unfortunate.
[625.41] I am dying to see my children happy.
[630.79] I don't know whose evil eyes 
have caught my children
[635.09] that they never have any happiness and
if they do they aren't beneficial for them.
[641.27] May God make it better for them.
[643.69] He will create ease.
[646.28] That's true. But I thought
you could help me.
[652.33] After all she is your
sister in law, Shabana.
[657.59] For God's sake, tell them to
have some mercy on my daughter.
[663.04] Yes, of course sister, now
that you have talked to me
[666.85] I will talk to sister
Nimra about it for sure.
[669.09] And if necessary I will talk to Faiq too.
[672.29] Yes, please talk to them and tel them.
[677.21] Otherwise I could have
set them straight myself,
[680.16] but we just suffer because
we are noble people.
[686.97] People try to control
their son in laws first,
[689.73] so that they can get the whole
family dance to their tune.
[693.16] But we don't know how to be so shrewd.
[698.08] My elder son isn't with me
anymore, and Zaid isn't happy either.
[702.49] And now Nosheen isn't able 
to sustain her household either.
[705.60] Tell me honestly, Shabana, you must
be laughing on my misfortune in your mind
[712.24] and you must be
celebrating my helplessness.
[716.98] Because one doesn't get
as sad on one's own misery
[720.56] than one gets happy on others' pain.
[725.85] It isn't like that at all.
[727.96] Neither have I ever considered you as my
enemy, nor I ever celebrate anybody's pain.
[733.98] No, I didn't mean it like that. 
You took it wrong, Shabana.
[739.15] Obviously, you said something like that.
[741.80] Shabana, I am a human too. It
just slips out of my mouth at times.
[748.71] Now look, you have such ease in your life.
[752.21] You are leading a life with so much luxury.
[756.86] And apparently I have got
everything but  even then
[762.02] I really don't know what you
[766.39] think of as ease and luxury.
[772.98] But I am just happy.
[778.83] and content too on
whatever God has given me.
[782.75] That's nice, but may I say something?
[786.05] Your Aima's family is so weird.
[791.83] May be she could have coped with Faiq.
[796.98] That's the reality. Because
my Nosheen isn't that sharp.
[803.15] Don't know how she got in between
Faiq and Aima, my poor Nosheen.
[809.02] Well, she took this decision herself.
[811.72] And she shouldn't regret it now.
[813.93] Of course, now you are
going to hit me with taunts,
[817.42] because I have asked you something to do.
[822.80] Anyway, will you talk to them about
Nosheen and tell them not to do it?
[828.62] Sure, as soon as I get a
chance I will go to their place.
[834.49] Just don't worry, 
God will make things better.
[853.55] I think you must have decided by
now who do you want to live  with.
[863.03] What do you mean?
[865.35] Look, Zaid, it's very simple.
[867.78] Just tell me who do you want
in your life. Aima or me?
[872.59] And if you can't leave Aima 
then you should divorce me.
[877.03] Because I can't handle
this tug of war anymore.
[901.38] -Dad.
-Oh, thank you.
[904.12] Were you busy?
[906.40] No, I'm not busy at all, what is it?
[910.29] Good.
[912.25] We are extending our business,
[915.12] and I am happy about the fact that
you and Zaid are supporting me in it.
[919.40] -I am proud on you both.
-Thank you, Dad.
[922.93] I want you both to get regular now.
[925.33] Not just one or two projects but deal
with overall business matters now.
[932.02] What do you say?
[933.81] Dad, it's a huge responsibility.
[936.58] But still if you think that we are able
to do it then I have no issues with it.
[945.67] But still we will need your guidance.
[949.05] -I am always there to guide you both.
-That's true.
[954.19] If you ask me, I am completely
satisfied from your side.
[959.81] But with Zaid, I think he will take
a little time in completing things.
[966.38] In taking over complete responsibility.
[972.30] Zaid is still not able to
adjust his matters properly.
[978.03] -What do you think?
-About what, Dad?
[981.39] That he is still not happy.
[987.30] He stays a little disturbed.
[990.62] What can I say? Maybe you're right.
[994.19] I know it's easier said than
done in such a situation. But still...
[1002.12] I know one thing,
[1004.27] you are his good friend 
and now his wife too.
[1008.94] Remember, if he finds peace with you
[1011.77] he will be able to solve all his
problems and get out of them.
[1018.08] He will get rid of his tensions because
you are a wise and a loving wife.
[1023.90] You are no less than a blessing for a man.
[1028.38] I think you get what I mean.
[1032.62] Yes, Dad, I will try my best.
[1036.40] I am sure that you will prove
to be the best wife for Zaid.
[1039.59] And with time Zaid will
realise this fact too. You'll see.
[1046.37] Actually, these are official matters.
[1050.52] I wanted to get it done
in front of you both but
[1054.26] you both didn't come for lunch. 
I thought you both might have some plans.
[1059.65] No, Dad, we had no plans.
[1062.60] Really? I thought you
both must be together.
[1066.65] He has gone to get Zoya.
[1069.48] But he is back home. 
It's been long since he returned.
[1073.82] -Don't you know?
-No.
[1076.47] Zoya didn't return with him. 
Didn't he tell you anything?
[1080.97] No, I haven't talked to Zaid yet.
[1088.09] I have a feeling that he 
is worried because of Zoya.
[1093.77] Anyway, go ask him if
he even had lunch or not.
[1098.59] And please, if you think it's
appropriate ask him about Zoya too.
[1105.64] What are you thinking, Aima?
[1108.56] Nothing.
[1110.09] Dear, if he is worried about something
[1112.25] then it's your duty to help
him out of that problem.
[1115.24] Do I have to tell you both again and again
[1117.24] that you both have rights
and duties on each other.
[1120.89] You will have to understand that.
[1125.38] Yes, Dad.
[1127.52] -Where is your tea?
-I don't want to drink. You drink yours.
[1133.30] Okay.
[1148.65] Have you lost your mind?
[1150.68] Why do you keep calling and messaging me?
[1153.52] I am at my in laws, 
and I am a married woman.
[1157.09] And listen to me carefully, I don't
have any sympathy for you now.
[1162.92] And as much as you have suffered, 
I wish you would suffer even more than that.
[1169.29] Nosheen, just believe me, dear.
[1171.81] Don't you dare call me dear. 
I am not dear to you anymore.
[1176.67] And listen, I am not going
to get trapped by you now.
[1181.01] My life is ruined because of you.
[1184.57] I want to make everything right, 
just believe me.
[1188.80] Oh, come on. As if you can make them right.
[1191.42] And listen to me carefully,
[1193.46] now only call me when you have
to return my money, understood?
[1199.81] I will return it all. I promise you I am
going to return each and every penny.
[1203.67] That's a promise. Just believe me once.
[1213.04] Hello, Nosheen.
[1222.77] Did you come to say something
or are you spying on me?
[1226.58] I just came to tell that Shabana is coming.
[1229.98] -Auntie?
-Yes.
[1233.78] And I am going to the market
to get some stuff with the driver.
[1238.47] Just go to the kitchen. I have put the rice
to steam, turn off the stove in 7 minutes.
[1243.16] And the milk is on the stove too
for boiling. Just keep an eye on it.
[1246.32] -Okay, fine.
-I'll be back in a while.
[1250.40] Okay.
[1339.94] What happened, you...
[1342.54] Your hand was hanging down 
so I was putting it up.
[1349.05] You didn't even take off 
your shoes and slept.
[1353.17] It's 5:30 already. Been so much
time and I didn't even know it.
[1357.08] Dad was telling me that you didn't
eat anything, did you have lunch there?
[1362.12] -No.
-Why not? Why didn't you have lunch at home?
[1367.19] Just like that, I didn't feel like it.
[1369.67] Is there any problem?
[1374.02] But didn't you go to get Zoya?
[1379.63] Didn't she come with you?
[1383.82] No.
[1386.58] Did you both had a fight again?
[1388.57] Aima please, can we
talk about something else?
[1391.00] Sure, but first eat something. 
It's too late.
[1395.77] -I don't want to eat right now.
-But why?
[1399.78] Please, I'm not hungry.
[1403.12] How can it be? You just had a
couple of slices of bread since morning.
[1407.84] Aima, please, don't bother me.
[1413.45] Okay then I won't eat either.
[1417.84] What do you mean? Why didn't you eat?
[1420.29] I didn't feel like it, 
but now I feel hungry.
[1425.02] Then eat it now.
[1431.13] Okay, listen,
[1433.45] I'll just freshen up,
then we will eat together.
[1437.74] All right.
[1480.05] Your phone has been ringing for so long.
[1482.41] Why don't you keep it with you?
[1484.41] You should have left it there. 
When did I ask you to get it?
[1488.11] It was ringing continuously
near me that's why I got it.
[1490.29] By the way, who is this lady?
[1493.89] -Excuse me?
-Why? I'm just asking who is she?
[1499.12] Why are you asking?
[1501.62] And what would you do by knowing it?
[1504.37] What do you mean why am I asking?
I am your wife.
[1507.31] Well then stay like a wife.
[1510.89] No need to guard me, understood.
[1517.00] I get several calls in a day, I can't
submit the call record of every call I get.
[1523.09] The one you feel guilty about, usually
you aren't able to tell about them only.
[1528.02] Well you may think like that. Now please,
go from here and let me stay in peace.
[1574.40] Zoya, if you were coming
you should have told me,
[1577.56]  I would have come
to pick you up myself.
[1583.04] Actually I had no plans, but I got in
the mood early morning so I came.
[1587.74] Besides the driver dropped me.
And I haven't got my stuff either.
[1592.85] I thought you must be waiting for me.
[1596.54] But I think I was mistaken.
[1602.44] By looking at you it seems as if
you were waiting for me to leave
[1605.61] that when I am going to leave
and when you can live without fear...
[1608.13] Why are you doing this, Zoya?
[1614.10] You are assuming everything yourself.
[1617.26] Like what?
[1618.33] Like, why do you think 
that I didn't miss you?
[1620.93] I missed you God dammit. That's why
I came to pick you as soon as I landed.
[1627.30] Not as soon as you landed,
you came to pick me the next day.
[1632.67] Anyway, I believe what you
are saying like I always do.
[1639.54] It doesn't seem like you
missed me by looking at you.
[1642.67] Why are you being so bitter?
[1644.73] Oh, am I hurting you Zaid?
[1650.60] I'm so sorry. I didn't meant to.
[1653.81] I'm already too stressed, Zoya.
[1658.81] Will you just stop being sarcastic?
[1663.98] Can't we sit and talk like normal people?
[1666.88] Really? Is everything
normal like it used to be?
[1672.26] It's only things like these
that you say which hurt me.
[1674.61] Of course it's only
what I say that hurts you.
[1679.48] That's why you go to Aima to vent out.
[1683.14] It's nothing like that, Zoya.
[1688.27] Having a good time?
[1691.06] Don't you lie to me, Zaid.
[1695.42] And I'm sorry I ruined
your moment with her.
[1702.36] It seemed as if you are on a honeymoon
flight and I have come like bad weather.
[1708.62] You think I was lying?
[1711.37] When did I say that?
[1712.79] Zoya if you have even a little doubt,
you may inquire at the airline office.
[1717.62] Right, like this is the only thing
I have to do to keep inquiring.
[1730.89] Leave Aima and your dad's house.
[1735.58] Zaid, I will talk to mom, she will arrange
for your job and house, everything.
[1746.52] Are you serious, Zoya? What
the hell are you talking about?
[1749.86] I am saying all this to you
[1752.44] because be this girl quarrelsome,
ill-mannered or unskilled,
[1758.36] you will have to spend
your life with her now.
[1761.74] I don't know how am I going to spend it.
[1765.88] Wow, what a way to explain your son.
[1769.16] I am really impressed.
[1770.73] Everyone should have
a mother in law like you.
[1773.04] You are fueling up your
son and then telling him
[1775.06] that he will have to
spend his life with me?
[1777.58] If I slit your throat and then
say sorry, would it be okay?
[1784.78] Zaid you loved my
daughter so much, didn't you?
[1788.39] You married her and took her from
