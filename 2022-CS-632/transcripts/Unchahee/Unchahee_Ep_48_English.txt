From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned to chirp from you I was thinking of going to lunch
tomorrow after our presentation. No, I won't be coming to office tomorrow. Aima, is everything all right? I tried to talk sweetly with
your son on your advice. Then? Then what? He thinks
of himself as something. He is so proud. -Rather do one thing. You want money?
-Yeah. Then go and jump off a roof. I promise I will pay for your shroud.
You won't die like you don't have anyone. Just try and die once. Well, I am not going to die so easily. And if I die, I will cause
many others to die with me. What do you mean? You are wise enough to
understand what I'm saying. You will get fever. Wear this. You are just... Oh, I'm so sorry guys.
I didn't want to disturb you both. No, Zoya, it's nothing like
what you think, we were just... talking. It is like that, Zaid. Besides there
was such a nice romance going on and I spoiled it for no reason. Nosheen, one day you are going to
make us stop breathing. Tell me what it is? -Mama, I need some money.
-How much money? Around a 100,000 rupees. A hundred thousand? talk slowly someone might listen. Why do you want so much money, Nosheen? I can't tell you that. Oh, God. Are you involved
in something again? Please don't do any stupidity this time. Tell me are you involved in something? -Mama, what are you talking about?
-First tell me what is it or else I won't give any money. I have to give the money to Faisal. Oh my God, this girl 
will disgrace me again. Mama, get hold of yourself, 
what are you doing? Nosheen, are you having an
affair with him even after marriage? Aren't you satisfied yet even
after bearing so much loss? Mama, just listen, it's nothing like that. I don't believe anything that you say now. -I swear upon you, Mama.
-Don't you swear upon me falsely. Mama, please trust me. I can
swear upon anybody. I swear upon God. Tell me why do you have to pay him? Mama, he is blackmailing me. But don't worry, I know how to handle him. Just give me the money
so that I can give it to him. And give it to me before Faiq
arrives, so please give it to me quickly. Otherwise if Faiq arrives, 
it's going to be a problem. -Dad, you called me?
-Hey, you have come to office? With whom? I hailed a cab. A cab? Why? Didn't Zaid drop you? You could have taken the other car. It's okay, dad. I can come by myself. 
The office isn't that far. Whatever it is, I don't
like you coming in a cab. What is it? You seem dull today. 
Anything wrong? No, Dad, I'm all right. No, you don't seem fine. I have got a little fever since yesterday. You should have taken off then, 
why did you come? No, it was just a mild fever, 
but I had taken the medicine. But still, I'll ask Zaid to
take you to the doctor. No, please don't ask him
anything to do, I am okay. Aima, is Zaid behaving nicely with you? Yes, everything is fine. Don't you worry, I will talk to him. No, Dad, just leave it. Stop it. Till when are you going to
keep asking him to do things? I don't want the forced love 
and forced respect. All of it seems fake. -But I was just...
-I know, Dad, that you love me a lot. That's why you keep
reminding him of my rights. But I want to request something to you, please don't force him to do things. He is a human, after all 
he has a right to live his own life. He is divided in two halves. Because of you forcing him, he is
compelled to behave nicely with me. I don't have any complains from him. But I don't want fake love from him either. Please, never ever force him for it again. Take this and leave me alone now. How can I leave you like that? -What do you mean?
-No, I didn't mean that. If you think that I got scared
of you then it isn't like that at all. You know very well that
Nosheen isn't scared of anyone. I am just helping you out. I know. I have hurt you a lot. But I promise I will never do that again. Stop pretending and let me go. Listen, Nosheen, I really miss you. Faisal, have you gone mad? 
Someone might see us. I am really sorry. I have hurt you a lot, but
honestly I want to marry you. I want to have a home with you. There is no use of all this now. Just
keep this money and leave me alone. You'll see, now that you
have given me this money, I will pay off all your
debt in just a few days. -By the way, is this the full amount?
-I had 50,000/- only. I don't have any more. Besides,
I am not responsible for you. Nosheen, how am I going to
arrange the rest of the money? It's not my problem. Go work
somewhere or beg on the streets. I don't care. Okay, half the money is fine. My dear, you are too stupid. 
But very useful. Not just a hundred thousand, I will mint
hundreds of thousands of rupees from you. Oh God, oh my Lord, 
save my daughter from this problem. What sins have we committed,
oh Lord. Please forgive us. Save my daughter's marriage, my Lord. Oh, Nosheen please pick up. Pick up, my child. Don't know why she isn't picking up. Oh, Nosheen please pick up. Where are you, my child? Oh, Lord. Where are you, Nosheen. 
Pick you mother's call. So, tell me, how is work? Honestly very busy. I have come
here by skipping a meeting. What is it? Oh, I'm so sorry to disturb you. No, it's okay. The schedules will carry on.
You said it's something important so I though I should come and ask. Actually, I am thinking
of starting a new venture. And it's my own investment. And the issue is that I don't
have any supporting hand. How can I manage all this alone, you know. Zoya is least interested in my business. But I have you. Like my own son. And your business
management skill is very good too. So I was expecting
you to take interest in it. Sure that's really great, why not? As I said I have a really
hectic schedule right now but don't worry I am
definitely going to help you. I am not asking for your help, dear. I am talking about 50% partnership
in my business. Actually, auntie, you know it
how much dad relies on me. I have a key post in the office too. I don't think it can be possible. But Aima is there to handle his business. You are right but still... Just think it over it thoroughly. You are doing a job I your dad's business. And I am offering you a 50% partnership. And I wanted to ask
something else too from you. Yes, sure. Son, you took Zoya from
me with so much love. And you know very well that
Zoya's happiness matters a lot to me. I waited really long after
you both got married, but things are not moving 
in the right direction. Auntie, I can understand your concern but I
think Zoya needs to learn a few things too. I mean, we are in a committed relationship in which at times a
person agrees to something and sometimes expects
the other to agree to them. But this habit of hers to
be stubborn over everything or make everything
an issue about her ego, she has to quit that. I think that Zoya has a lot of
complaints from you too, but I am talking about
the solution to this problem. You love Zoya a lot too, I know that. Whatever happened in the
past few days after your marriage I don't want to discuss it here. But because of all that Zoya is
disturbed mentally and emotionally. What I am going to ask you now is
just to bring peace in lives of you both. Hello, Nosheen. Yes, Mama, why are you
calling me again and again? I am so worried because of you. Oh, telling you something
make things more difficult. At least tell me, was there any
problem when you went to meet him? There wasn't any problem at that
time, but it can be a problem now. -What do you mean?
-I mean my dear, Mama, where am I right now? At my in laws. And the amount of details
your are expecting from me, if I start telling you then
everyone would know about it. Okay, Nosheen, I'm hanging up,
just tell me was there any problem? No, I didn't have any problem. And don't you worry, I know very
well how to deal with guys like Faisal. I am going to call the police
and he will straighten up. No, Nosheen, for God's sake
don't do anything of this sort. Okay, don't worry, 
I won't do anything like that. You solve the
problem of your home. What should I handle?
I just don't understand. Okay now just hang up
or they might doubt you. -Bye.
-Bye, and listen, Nosheen, Yes, what is it? You are not going to keep any
contact with this guy, okay? No contact. Yes, don't you worry, bye. Oh God take my daughter
out from this issue. If you have a solution
please do let me know. What is it that I should
do so that she gets happy. But please, auntie, please don't demand
anything from me that I am unable to do. Like what? Like, like me leaving Aima. Because it's not possible. Fine, then there is
just one solution to it. -You and Zoya should move to my house.
-Excuse me? What are you talking about, auntie? You want me to leave my home and stay
at your place like a live in son in law? Please, Zaid, it's a positive solution. Don't think of it with 
a typical, middle class mentality. Leaving your home wouldn't mean at all that you are going to cut
your ties off with you family. It's just for change. 
And I think you need it too. That's not possible, 
I can't leave my parents. They are not alone, Zaid. There is sister, Shabana, his family,
Aima. There is everyone with him. To tell you the truth 
I am the one who is alone. I need you both, Zaid. And when a girl can leave her
home and live at the guy's house, why can't a guy leave his home for her? I can understand your concern, auntie but I'm sorry, anyone
who does that is considered really bad in the society that we live in. He has to listen to
other people's taunts too. So, if it's only about
living in the girl's house, then I can get you both a separate home. You guys can shift there. Auntie, it's not about affordability.
Even I can get a separate house for Zoya. -But...
-Zaid, this suggestion doesn't
have any ulterior motive, nor it is to cut you
off with your family. I just want to see you both happy. And for that you have
to get out of that house. Only then you guys can relax. And this step is going to bring 
a lot of change in your life. Trust me. -But , auntie , I think...
-Dear, think over it thoroughly
and then give a response. I know that this is not going to
be easy for you, it's a huge step. Don't worry I am going to talk to him. No, Dad, just leave it. Stop it. Till when are you going to
keep asking him to do things? I don't want this forced love 
and forced respect. Then there is just one solution to it. -You and Zoya should move to my house.
-Excuse me? What are you talking about, auntie? You want me to leave my home and stay
at your place like a live in son in law? Please, Zaid, it's a positive solution. Don't think of it with 
a typical, middle class mentality. Why are you crying, I took
the glass out. Does it still hurt? -No.
-Then why are you crying? Zaid, can I ask something from you? Sure, go ahead. Your indifference hurts me a lot. Zoya, for God's sake. Instead of understanding my problem
you are threatening me on everything. I'm not threatening you, Zaid,
I'm just expressing my intention. My life has become so pathetic. I didn't even imagine that Faiq
is going to treat me this way. And this Faisal is hanging
like a sword over my head. Now he has started blackmailing. What are you doing? I should be the one asking that. 
What are you doing? What's wrong? Give me my phone. Would you like to explain? You
said you are going to meet your friend. Well she is my friend. Stop lying, Faiq. What's there to lie? 
She is my school friend. She might have been your friend in school, but now you are openly
having an affair with her. What are you saying?
Are you in your senses? Don't try to act too innocent. 
I know everything. The way you are busy on chat and
call, ignoring me, I understand everything. What? Tell me, who is this girl because
of whom you are ignoring me? What are you doing, Nosheen, leave me. I'm going to tell your mother. I'll
tell everyone that you are a fraud. Look, Nosheen, Sania
is just my friend, that's it. Do you think I'm a fool? I know very well that you
are having an affair with him. Friends do not meet in private like that,
they don't take such slefies together. You know what, Nosheen? 
You're a sick person. Get yourself treated. Sister, how are you doing? Wow, great. Eventually this day came too. When Liaqat told me that you are
here then I asked him again to confirm. Why? Can't I come here? The doors of this house will
always be open for you and Zoya. But if you both don't like
it here, what can I do then. No, it's nothing like that. The situations get so that... What else? What brought you here? I was waiting that my sister is going to call me
and check up if  I am dong all right. But neither you called
nor you came to visit. Everything is right in front of you. I have visited your place
so many times to reconcile. But then I lost hope and stopped trying. You and Zoya are continuously
holding me responsible. I'm a human too, how much can I tolerate? You know very well that I
never wanted this to happen. I can understand, sister. That's why I am here to
make up for my mistake. I've realized what you have said. What did I say? You said that blood relations
should never cut off from each other. You are absolutely right. Blood relation can never be cut off. It's good that you guys got it. Otherwise I was just fed up visiting
your house and trying to appease you. You are right, sister. I misbehaved
with you so much for no reason. Anyway, I feel good that you came. I have realized that staying
together is better for both of us. Until we are one, nobody
can dare to move us. You have got it, I have got it
but Zoya still doesn't understand. What do you mean? Tell your daughter to
stay in good terms with me. She talks back at me, I'm not just her auntie now, I'm her mother
in law. She should at least regard that. What can I say about kids these days. Now look at Nosheen, 
after all I have forgiven her, didn’t I? You should ignore such
little things by Zoya too. And I'm sure. She will get better with
time too. Everything is going to be fine. And I have decide. No matter what the situation is
but we have to support each other. Anyway, aren't you going
to offer me any tea today? Why not, in fact I'll
ask them to serve lunch. Here, Faiq, have some water. Salman, I can't stay
with this girl anymore. -I really want to quit.
-Will you tell me what happened? Same old quarreling. Same old problems. I can't tolerate this girl anymore, 
I have had it now. You don't take such decisions
of leaving home so emotionally. What do you think? I am saying all
this just because I am emotional now? Yeah. For God's sake man, this
hasn't happened the first time, it's not the first incident. I have told all this to you already. I don't have this much temperament. Faiq, men have temperament. That's why they have been
made the decision makers. And you shouldn't take
this decision emotionally. Really? She may keep
doubting me, taunting me, keep fighting with me, and you
say that I am not facing much? I didn't say that at all. But the things you tell me
those are really common for girls. Getting jealous, taunting, all
these factors are very normal. I don't think there's
anything strange about it. Salman, whatever you say but I
am not interested in this girl anymore. -Should I say something?
-What? I have a feeling that
you regret marrying her. As soon as you got married to
her, you have lost interest in her. May be. Please don't mind, Faiq, but as much it was her fault,
you are equally responsible for it. Whether you agree
or not, that is the truth. Yes, probably you are right. Finding happiness by hurting
others may never find peace. I think you shall distance
yourself from Sania. Not just your wife, 
no girl would like that. But Salman, I am not
having any affair with Sania. I am sure that's how it is, but still. She doesn't have issue with Sania
only. She has a problem with everyone. She is an immature girl, very careless. That's why I am unable to like her. Tell me, does auntie know what
is going on between your two? Mom knows everything,
she lives under the same roof. She has an idea about
everything, and still she lectures me. That's a good thing. It is good but I can't say much in
front of her, because this was my wish. Anyway, go home and sort it out now. No, I'm not going home. 
I have to go for some work. Are you going to Sania's place? But you always stay so
chilled out, what's wrong today? Did your wife throw you out of the house? -You guessed it right.
-Oh, no problem. If she threw you out then go back to her. Dad, I wanted to talk
to you about something. Sure, go ahead. I have to talk to you too. But you go first. I was just thinking Dad that for everyone's benefit, I take
Zoya and move out from here. Auntie, tell you son to stop. -Is everything all right? What happened?
-Your son is fooling around with girls. How can you say that? Whatever I'm saying is the truth. He keeps talking to girls all day long,
meet them privately and what not. Nosheen, how can you talk
like that about your husband? I'm not just accusing him. I
have proof of all his cheap deeds.
