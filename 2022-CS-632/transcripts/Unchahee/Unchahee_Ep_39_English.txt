From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you I swear, never again. I will never take any
decision that hurts you. Nor will I let anybody
make such a decision. It's a promise and I won't let it break. He got very upset when Zoya left. He was like that for everyone. Now that she is back,
he will accept you too. Not only as a friend,
but as a wife as well. You should have been to
your in laws on your way back then. - Why?
- Because your wife has gone there. Do you actually want that
we become sisters again? - Yeah, Amber, of course.
- It's possible on one condition only that you remove Aima from Zoya's way. Where did my journey had to stop Where did life take a turn Forget him Just remember what you have got Hi, how are you? -Where were you?
-I went to my mom's where else? -So, you didn't bother to even tell me?
-I did call you, Faiq. You didn't call me at all, Nosheen. Oh, yes, I called
but it didn't get through. Well, one can send a message too.
There are many other ways to contact. What's wrong, Faiq? Look, Nosheen, from now on, you
won't go anywhere without asking me. You will go only if you have my
or mom's permission otherwise not. I went to my Mama's,
not to meet any boyfriend. -What nonsense, Nosheen?
-What's so wrong in that? Don't you even know how to talk to someone? You are married now.
You should respect this relationship. And look, don't go like this again. It isn't
considered nice in our family to go out like this. I told your mother that I'm going. You just informed her,
you didn't take permission from her. Well, do I need to get her signatures on
a permission letter even to visit my mom's place? Yes, exactly, that's how it's going to be. If you are not allowed then
you won't go anywhere, that's it. By the way, what was the
emergency that you had to go there? Actually, Zoya is back,
so I went to meet her. What do you have to do with her? Didn't you say it yourself that it doesn't make
any difference to you with someone else's life. It's something concerning my house. Look, Nosheen, this is your house now so it's better that you take interest
in issues concerning this house. What's wrong, Faiq,
why are you getting so furious? I asked you something and
you didn't even pay any heed to it. One question after another,
am I in a court room? What did I tell you? That you should
help mom, do chores in the kitchen,  have you been in there yet? I went there, Faiq, but your mother got
angry and asked me to get out from there. You're lying. You are
falsely accusing my mom. Faiq, why are you talking to me like that.
Nobody has ever talked to me like that. For sure your mother has poisoned you
against me in my absence, she is too cunning. Shut up, Nosheen, stop this nonsense. Look, I can't here a single word
against my mother. And the most important
person in my life is my mother. If you want me to stay happy
then you'll have to keep her happy. This way neither my tone
will change nor my mood. Is he out of his mind?
What does he think of himself? I will have to set him straight. How dare he get angry at me. How did your dinner go last night? It was okay, in fact it was nice. When are you joining office then? I think you should join soon. I'm going to join as soon as
the situation gets better here at home. -Aima is joining office from tomorrow.
-Okay. If she is starting work, this means
that everything is normal at home. I think you too shouldn't
delay joining the office. Okay, I'll just have to take care of
a couple of things and then I'll join. I'd like you to come to office
with Aima like you guys used to. Dad, I was thinking what if
Zoya joins office with me too. You know how official matters are,
you have to look after a lot of things. It's better that Zoya
spends some time at home. As soon as there is a place
according to her qualification in office I'll let her join. Okay, Dad, I'll go now. Zaid, sit, I have to talk to you
about something important. Sit down. If you have anything to talk about
other than Aima, then please... What do you mean by that? Zaid I have been noticing that you are
ignoring everything related to that girl. I have told you this
a lot of times before too. But I don't see that you are
giving importance to what I say. Zaid, if you have taken the responsibility
then you will have to fulfill it as well. It's important, you will be
answerable for that as a husband. God may let go of his rights but he will not forgive if one
doesn't give people their due rights. Aima is your wife give her, her due rights. You have to give her her rights
either you want to or not. If Aima stays quiet that doesn't mean that you treat her as you like and nobody
is going to question you about it too. I can't see injustice being
done to anyone in my house. Half of my life is spend
advising my wife and daughter to be fair to my sister and niece. And I don't want that rest of my
life is spent in lecturing you about it. And I hope we don't have
to talk about this topic again. Zaid, you here, at this hour? What is it? Everything all right? Have I done anything wrong? Sit down. Look, Aima, We are bound in this relationship
due to a compulsion. Maybe it was in our fate. But whatever has
happened wasn't good. To both of us. And ironically everyone has got expectations from me. Now you tell me how can
I keep everyone happy? Zaid, you don't need
to keep anyone happy. Just keep Zoya happy. I wanted that too. But it isn't possible in this situation. Why isn't it possible, Zaid? This is dad's house and
we go by his principles here. Nobody can go against him. Anyway, I have come here to
tell you that I'm not angry with you. I just got so worried in this situation
that I was running away from reality. Maybe that's why
I misbehaved with you too. Aima, I never meant to hurt you I, in fact I am surprised at
myself why I treated you like that? I... please forgive me. That's not needed, I can understand
what position you are in right now. But the truth is that
you are my wife and... I'm your husband. And there are some duties and
right attached to this relationship but I'm afraid I won't be able
to fulfill them for now. But trust me, Aima, I will
try my best to keep you happy. I don't want anything from you, Zaid. I am not expecting
anything from you either. But... -I have got a request.
-Sure, go ahead. Don't distance yourself from me. I am going to stay like your friend
as we were before. I will never ask anything from you. But please, don't divorce me. I know what you are going through. But believe me, my child, it was necessary
for me to take that decision that time. This is what was required. Aima... -Aima, everyone is blaming me.
-I haven't committed any sin either, Dad. But I am being judged too. If you get angry with me too,
where am I going to go? It's you only who understands me. Who can share my sorrows. Aima dear, please don't be angry with me. I'm not angry with you. -But...
-Don't be sad, my child. I took this decision for my
sister's life and your happiness. My happiness? What happiness, Dad? Do you think I can ever
be happy in my life again? Why are you getting so depressed, Aima? Time is the greatest healer. Give
this relationship a little time at least. I'm sure the situation isn't
going to remain the same always. Things will get better
with the passage of time. Whatever happened, neither I
am responsible for it nor my sister. Is there any shame in you or not? What are you saying, Amber? Why? What do you want now? Should I still respect
this shameless person? Hey you, behave yourself! You are standing in my house
and talking to me in this tone. Don't you know what I can do to you? Try to threaten someone else. Neither am I going to
get scared of your threats, nor am I going to care
about any relationship now. Fine, do whatever you can! You'll see now what
I am going to do with you. I am going to take such a revenge of all the
injustice that have been done to my daughter that you are going to
remember it all your life. Yeah, Zoya, tell me how are you doing? -Mom, I'm fine, absolutely fine.
-Great. You know we went out for dinner last night. The same place where he had proposed me. So, did she go along with you two? No, Mom, what did she had to do there. Well, I can't say anything
about the rules in your house. No, Mom, just don't worry. It was my condition for
returning in Zaid's life that Aima's presence
wouldn't matter to him. And Aima has understood very clearly. It's just uncle who creates
hurdles in everything. But, Zoya, listen to me carefully. Look, you don't have any
written agreement with Aima. And you shouldn't forget that she
has got all the support in that house. In fact even Zaid listens to her a lot too. So, you know it your father in law has got a crooked mind, and if she has his support
Aima won't take long to change. Yes, Mom, you're right. That's why, as soon as you can
get rid of this girl, get her divorced. Mom, it can't be done so soon.
I'll need a little time. Make life hell for Zaid
until he leaves her. Mom, I'm waiting for the
right time and right moment. Okay, listen, I am
sending tickets for you both. -Tickets?
-Yeah, tickets, for you honeymoon. Really, Mom? I'm so excited. My child, you guys have been through
such a big phase in the past few days. It's time to relax. Thank you, Mom. You're the best mom ever. Anyway, tell me where are the tickets for? That's a surprise.
You can see when you get them. Really, Mom? I'm so excited. Just stay happy. -Bye.
-Okay, my love, good bye. Hello, Zoya, Yeah, he is sleeping here. All right, I'll wake him up. Zaid. Zaid. Zaid. Zoya has been calling you for so long. I didn't know now I slept here. -When did she call?
-She called a while ago. She has been calling you for long. If you were up you should
have woken me up too. I thought I shouldn't
disturb you while sleeping. And by the way, I'm hoping that you
won't tell dad anything. Yeah okay, whatever you want
is going to happen. Thank you. Zoya, tell me why are you angry?
I told you before I went there. Just listen to me, what's wrong? When did you tell me that
you'll be back? 5:00 am. -Yeah I did but...
-But what, Zaid? I went to sleep, I'm sorry. -It's not a big issue.
-Not a big issue? Zaid, if you consider yourself in my place, you would know how it
feels to wait for someone. Look, Zoya, I'm sorry but
I didn't break any promise. Besides, I would need to go there
after every few days, you know it well. So what are you expecting from me? Just that we don't fight over
this topic over and over again. I'm not fighting with you, Zaid. Yeah I know, but still your mood is off. I don't even want that. I just want
you to accept this relationship happily. Yeah, I know, and gradually you are going
to make me agree to everything you want. And one day you are going to say that uncle
wants to see mine and Aima's children. Please, Zoya, you'll have to trust me. The promise I had made
to you, I have kept it. And I can't do it without your support. You have no idea
that I wasn't able to sleep all night. -Why?
-What do you mean, why? My husband was with
someone else all night and I... Relax, Zoya, I love you.
You're my whole world. Do you love me that much? Do you doubt me? Try me if you want. Let the time come. What the hell, man. It's a mess here. Who is going to clean all
this mess, where is the duster? Who will clean all this mess? If the old woman sees her
kitchen in this condition then... It's nice, I will be saved
from coming in here. -Hello, Mama.
-Hello, Nosheen. -Mama, I'm in a very bad shape right now.
-What happened? Has anyone said something to you? Tell me. Faiq's mom was telling
me that Faiq likes semolina sweet, chick pea curry
and flour flat-bread a lot. My God, why are you crying
on that, can't you make it? That's what I'm doing. -Then why are you crying?
-I don't know how to make this stupid food. What's to worry about it? Just
go in the internet and search for it. It would have been great if the way you are
advising me, it could be made as easily too. All brides use the internet and
cook, I don't know what's your issue. Please come here and cook
for me, I am not able to do all this. Nosheen you are absolutely lack any skill. Don't give me suggestions but
a solution that what I should do. The kitchen is a mess right now
and if that old woman sees then... Nosheen, talk slowly,
someone might hear you. It's good that she hears, at least
she won't let me in her kitchen then. If she hears this, then not only in her kitchen, 
she won't even let you in her house. Honestly, Mama, I am in
bad state in just a few days. That mother and son
have so many issues that they don't even
want to hire a servant. Okay, now enough of this drama. You were dying to marry him, no bear it. Look, Nosheen, you will have to get settled
there, you don't have any other option. Did you just call to taunt me? Mother's cook food and
send to their daughters' house so that they are respected in
their in laws, and here you are... Listen to me, why don't you ask your mother
in law. She will tell you how to make it. I don't know what you want, Nosheen. Didn't you have any
lamer suggestion to give? Even you are scolding me.
Forget it, I will find a solution myself. Every one scolds me all the
time. I don't want to talk to you, bye. Oh, God, Nosheen! What
have you done to my kitchen? Oh wow, these are tickets to Europe, wow! Yeah, they both were so
stressed in the past few days I thought they will get
fresh if they go out for a trip. But, Amber, aren't two days very
less to get prepared for traveling? What preparations? They just have to get
ready a bag each and go sit in the plane. I have made arrangements of all
the reservations and pick and drop. That's an amazing surprise. My daughter deserves it too. May God save our children from evil eyes. Tell me, do you want to have
tea or should I get lunch served? I'll have tea. -Greetings, Mom.
-Greetings. How are you doing and how was your day. Don't ask please. I don't get it, what's wrong? I have spent all day in
cleaning my messed up kitchen. But who messed up the kitchen? Why don't you ask this to your wife? -Did Nosheen go to the kitchen today?
-She has got zero skills. She much more inefficient than I imagined. -Mom, what is so wrong that she did?
-What can I say? I wish I had taken a picture 
of the kitchen then you would have had an idea then 
what she did with it. She has got no idea. She knows
nothing, no sense to work at all. Even a small kid won't do
what she did to the kitchen. It took me a whole day to clean it. But why did you clean it yourself? Who should have I asked then? I mean you should have asked Nosheen,
she should have cleaned it herself. Just forget it, Faiq, she doesn't need to. To tell you the truth, she wouldn't
have been able to clean it either. Tell her, she shouldn't even cross 
from in front of my kitchen. But, Mom, if she won't go to the
kitchen how is she going to learn? No, she doesn't need to. I can cook and feed
you both until I'm alive. Mom, if he won't go, how will she
learn to cook? How is she going to learn? I don't know. I just don't understand, why don't mothers teach their daughters how
to do things before they get them married? Do you remember how much her
mother was praising the taste in her hands? -I'm telling you, they both were lying.
-Okay, Mom, relax. Just forget whatever happened
and please give her a chance. Faiq, if she is so interested she should
go and learn it at her mother's house. I am not running an academy here. You are blindfolded my your mother's love. And you are unable to see anything. But it's okay. What ever I do for you both,
I can never be good enough. Listen, where is Zaid? Is he happy? Of course, Mom, why wouldn't he be happy? Okay, now be careful,
someone might create a drama. You have been so strangely since I have
returned home. Are you in your senses? What do you care? 
All you care about is your mother. Mind your language, got it? This is how I talk. Then do one thing, 
get up from here and get lost. As if you are so well-mannered. 
Have you ever noticed your tone? My tone gets bad when
your attitude gets bad.
