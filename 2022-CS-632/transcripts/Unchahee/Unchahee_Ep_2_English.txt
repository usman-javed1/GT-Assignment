I am not aware of this. [Sangeet] I do n't know what is going on in brother's mind. But Amma Faiq is not older than me. There is not that much difference. Son, there must be a difference of about seven years. And you know that there was a difference between me and your father too. Amma Jaan, in those days, such marriages were acceptable. Nowadays, there should not be so much difference. Son, no matter what the time, the difference does not matter. [Sangeet] Marriage is successful with patience and understanding. If pride and stubbornness come in between, then the relationship is left behind. [Sangeet] Amma, mother, I want to ask you something. Amma, what are you saying? You don't need permission to ask me anything. [Sangeet] Hey son, do you like anyone? [Sangeet] What kind of a question is this? Amma, look son, nowadays girls often make an ideal in their heart and also like a boy like that. So I thought of asking you. There is no such thing. But, if it is so, then son, remember that loving someone is a habit, but if you don't get that person, then your love will end.  Never be stubborn but why ammi because son we get only what is destined for us [sangeet] it means that there is someone no no ammi there is no such thing I was just thinking about what you said [sangeet] Baba it is very interesting for you may you live long thank you very much thank you tea looks very good from your face itself where else would you have been you do n't even have time to sit with baba it is possible that I don't have time for you then I felt it was wrong maybe no no you can never make a mistake it is possible that I have been negligent how dare I ever argue on any matter or question you whatever you say is the last thing for me then why what how nothing remains stay safe live long may Allah give you a long life amen well I had told your mother to let you study now marriage will happen you don't have any objection you are upset with my words whatever you have thought for me you must have thought for the best stay happy son stay alive you always respect me my baba if I am happy then I am happy may Allah always keep you safe on my head you also did not live after drinking tea  Have you had your breakfast before me, how was it? Very good, very good Zoya, check it. I remember I got a message from the girl to whom I had given my number yesterday. You should be happy with this friend, will you stop being jealous? Excuse me, it doesn't matter to me whether you talk to one girl or all the girls in the university. I don't care, right friend, stay a little away from me or if you are burning too much, I am feeling hot. Please, ok, Ima, you should listen to his nonsense a little. Yes, what nonsense, he who keeps himself happy by doing it with girls. Actually, both of you don't value me. The day you will realize my value, you will regret a lot. Mark my words, you will regret a lot. ok, ok, you have some misunderstanding. What ever, by the way, lost and sad, where were you, what were you doing, thank God, the firing of you both is over, I was taking the class and where were you both missing? I got late but he was engrossed in thoughts of that girl. No, no, I actually knew, I was confident that Ayawa would take the class, so I said, what is the need for us to take him, he is in the class and  Sir I am asking about both of you so what did you say what did I say I made an excuse for both of you useless people can you [Music] Believe me friend if you are a friend then just like this yes yes of course come this was the last time yes yes done done okay done okay okay okay okay come let's go to eat something she is always hungry she gets up I will make a meal and Zoya see this happens friend brother today you are going to office late no it was just that night I slept a little late that's why I am fine are you well are you not well no I am not well this just happens with time now where has Almas gone out okay okay okay [Music] what happened are you worried no brother I am not worried then what are you thinking Almas has said something tell me no no Bhabhi did not say anything to me look Shabana you cannot be worried without a reason I know very well brother you are getting worried for no reason I was thinking that Aima is a fatherless daughter and it is not possible that wherever she goes a good proposal comes from there what have you said  A fatherless daughter, I am not her father. She is dearer to me than my life. I love her as much as I love Nosheen. No brother, there is no such thing. But the reality is that I feel that if a good proposal is available for Ama, we should definitely look for it. Look, I know that because of me, you have lost faith in me. Bhaijaan, you should not think like this. You may not even say it. I know that I talked about Amaad and Yama's marriage. Now how would I know that Ama will cheat me and leave in the middle. No brother, I am saying this because yesterday Amber came and said that there is a good proposal. The boy is very good and has his own business. And then he will not even take dowry. Now how did this matter of dowry come in between. Everything that I have to buy for Nosheen, I will buy the same for Ama as well. Now, as far as the matter of the proposal is concerned, I do not want to say anything at this time. But I am her mother. Whatever you decide for her, it is better. Brother, do not take my words wrong. I do not have any such thing in my mind.  You have every right. Whatever decision you take for Aima, you will do it for the best. I will not talk to you about this anymore. So that's it. Then just believe that whatever I think for Nosheen, the same will be for Aima too. I am completely sure that you don't know what happened. I do n't want this. [Music] Sir, try to understand. It is very difficult for me to go out of the house these days. Dad comes early. It is impossible to go out of the office at night. My exams are also over. There is no excuse. Well, don't get angry. I will think of something. In fact, I will do one thing. Tomorrow I will come to meet you on the pretext of shopping. But only for a little while. And during the day, okay, now you put the phone down. If someone comes, it will become a problem. You don't know my father. Okay, now put it down. Fun, bye. [Music] [Music] How is this possible? How is it possible that a girl was chatting with boys in front of you and so much was happening under your nose? You didn't even know. You have some misunderstanding. You have misunderstood that you talked about a child.  It is not a good upbringing that this life should not be spent like this I have already thrown my son out of the house due to misunderstandings now stop taunting him on every small thing don't change the topic now answer what I am asking did you know that she talks to boys no you don't know how you would know that the one who talks behind other's children she is getting up to cannot look after her own daughter how would you know what do you want to say I want to say that the relation you are looking for for others for Ama along with Shabana find one for your Nausheen Nausheen is of studying age when she will be of marriageable age I will see she is studying which one she is studying she is of studying age but she is not studying once I get to know who that boy is then I will make it up in such a way that all her misunderstandings will be cleared without you investigating why are you getting so angry should I explain to her this time look at Nausheen no matter how many times I have given warning now time has passed she has crossed all limits now  Explain, take her mobile phone, make her sit at home, she will not go to college, what are you saying, I did not say anything that you cannot understand, such a big decision, her studies will be stopped midway, if studies have been stopped then go to hell, I told her that from today onwards she will not go to college, take her telephone back from her, find a good match for her and send her to her home, her studies will be stopped midway, I got it disconnected, I don't know what is left now, no phone, no college, what happened to dad, I do n't know, I have gone mad, you are in this father-daughter affair, uncle, why didn't you tell him anything, don't keep any expectations from me, I am tired of hiding your deeds from your father, neither does he get any sense nor does it reach your ears, what is the problem in talking to boys, all my college friends do this, your dad does not understand, there is no objection to the friendship between Aima and Zaid, don't argue with them, do n't object to their friendship, uff what nonsense brother, whatever it is, it is from your dad's side and in this house, the final decision is his, till when dad  We will live in the black and white era I don't know Nasheen uncle please explain to dad that he has asked for your phone and why the phone I am telling you uncle I will not give my phone Nausheen what do you want your dad should kill me why would I want this uncle please explain to him he is not ready to listen to me right now he has said that neither you will go to college nor you will use the phone and also that he will find a match for you and get you married soon he did not say that dig a pit and bury me in it fun uncle please save me by doing anything don't take my phone you are still worried about your phone not about missing your calls his is also worried but my personal things are in the phone right then he will talk to you himself ok brother wait I am giving you the phone please be patient for two minutes I am checking password is applied everywhere let's find out if any other issue has cropped up [Music] Ammi Jaan don't you think that Baba Jaan has taken a very strict decision in this way poor Nausheen's studies will be affected a lot [Music] Amma, why are you not saying anything? What should I say? The son and his father think for him, whatever they think will be good. You are right, but the poor girl's mistake was not so big that she should be forced to leave her studies. Look son, I don't want to talk about their matter. I just pray to Allah that whatever happens should be for the betterment of that girl and in her favor. [Music] Amma, does Baba have any objection to her friendship with boys? I mean, can't boys and girls be friends? Now look, Zaid and Zoya are also very good friends. No son, there is nothing wrong in this. Friendship is a good thing. But today 's children take wrong advantage of this and do something that is strictly prohibited in our religion. And if they don't do this, then son, there is nothing wrong in it. But our religion, our Mushaara, does not give a woman a free hand. A woman should stay within her limits. And anyway, son, everything looks good only within limits. So, it means that all restrictions are for girls. No, no, not like that.  It's not the point, boys should also stay within their limits, rather I say that there should be legitimate restrictions on boys as well, but this never happens, Amma, yes, you have said the right thing, but son, the girls in our house are very delicate, son, remember that girls should take every step with care because many people have an evil eye on them, yes, and if the girl does not take a single wrong step, her parents would lower their eyes out of shame, Amma, but Baba could have explained to Noshin with love also, yes, but at many places, parents have to be strict as well, that is what is for the betterment of the children, well, leave these things, Aima, Aima, come with me, where are you, Walekum Assalam, son, we both are going, we will be back, get up, Aima, yes, I will quickly, Aima, son [Sangeet] Wait, Aima, I can go to the mall, but why, what work do I have to get done, son, don't insist, please let me go, it's been a whole week since we three sat together, okay son, she will go again some day, you can't say anything, not from Po, Zaid, today  Let it be, Amma has some work with me [Praise] [Praise] [Music] Where are Nausheen and Zaid missing, why didn't they come to the dining table? Nausheen is in your room, did you not inform her that the food is served, I was not hungry, you should have told her that I need everyone's presence, I had told her but she didn't listen to me, go and tell her, if she thinks that I will return her phone and change my decision, then this is her misunderstanding and where did Zaid sahab go, he did n't inform me, you should keep an eye on me, you are a mother, Baba, that Zaid, your children are not milk-drinking babies who can't be left alone even for a moment, children of any age have to be kept under observation, what do you want to prove to the parents, if I am an irresponsible mother, then you should have gotten married again, why did you live, can you talk politely, can you not, answer whatever is said to you, is this a home or a court, keep standing in the dock all the time, keep answering, brother, brother, Zaid has gone towards Zoya, yes, then you couldn't have told me earlier  I kept sitting quietly with a dumpling in my mouth I should have told you earlier Bhabhi I was not getting a chance to talk between you two do n't be so innocent you knew this is what would happen some people will disrespect me in front of you no Bhabhi why would I want this if I answer why here you will get angry talk politely Almas you knew this is what would happen you will disrespect me and some people's hearts will get peace Bhabhi you don't sit and get angry and go oh let it be I understand everything first you made me fight you are showing sympathy yes Bhabhi Bhabhi let it be Shabana it is not possible to treat some people my mind has gone crazy [Sangeet] why did this happen I am not able to do this no I will not sit I wanted your phone Fun Fun it was somewhere so now you don't know where your phone is kept your brother had promised to get him and Aama married [Sangeet] yes Bhabhi I did and then when I didn't marry her you must have cried and whined a lot do n't live Naush this house belongs to your dad and in the jungle  One cannot take the lion by staying there, how many times does it take to sideline the brown lion
