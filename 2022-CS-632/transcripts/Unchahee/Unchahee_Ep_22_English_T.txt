[0.20] From flowers and from buds
[4.57] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.16] When I saw you
[14.11] I learned how to chirp from you
[18.94] There has been lot of change in Zaid
in past few months.
[24.40] There is one more child of yours
in this house other than Zaid.
[29.71] If you have taken her back in
then why don't you forgive her as well?
[35.03] Why do you keep mentioning her?
[37.34] Isn't it enough
that I have allowed her back home?
[39.91] Actually, your dad has
chosen a boy for you.
[47.76] Really?
[49.53] Yes, I don't know his name
[53.28] but my heart tells me
that he has chosen Zaid for you.
[68.80] Look, you can understand
my concern regarding Nosheen.
[72.80] Yes, sister, what is it? Tell me.
[76.49] And since Azmat has denied to take her to
his office, I am even more concerned, Amber.
[82.02] Yes, I got to know about it
and felt really bad about it.
[85.82] Because brother Azmat should care
about her after all she is his daughter.
[90.47] Had he cared for her, our house
wouldn't have been like hell, Amber.
[95.02] -Amber, I have to say something to you.
-Yes please?
[99.43] You have indebted me so
much in the past few days.
[103.20] Sister, what are you talking about?
[105.38] I haven't done any favors to you.
[107.47] Whenever you are in
a problem you can share it with me.
[111.02] Yes I know, that's why
there is another request.
[114.62] Oh come on, please
say what you want to say.
[118.27] You run your office quite well, you have
a good business and you are well settled.
[122.38] So, I was saying that
[124.16] why don't you hire Nosheen?
[126.85] Nosheen? Sister,
[133.71]  actually...
[135.37] What is it? Any problem, Amber?
[138.57] Yes, I wanted to say that she hasn't
even completed her education yet.
[144.26] And neither did you make her
take some course or diploma.
[147.69] Or else I would have definitely hired her.
[149.79] Amber, it's going to take too much time.
[153.32] There is no such course these days
which is less than a year's duration.
[159.51] Can't you just take her
to office with you, Amber?
[163.49] She is going to get trained
herself. And then later on
[165.80] I will ask Azmat and
get her placed in his office.
[170.67] No, I'm sorry, this isn't possible at all.
[174.75] Actually, we have to train our new staff.
[178.99] And then, I have faced so much
loss in my business last year
[183.43] that instead of hiring
employs we are firing them.
[186.60] Amber, I am not asking you
to hire her and pay her a salary.
[190.97] I just want that you keep her with you
[192.98] so that later on I have a reason
to get her placed in Azmat's office.
[197.72] Sister, I would have definitely kept her
with me, but you know how busy I am.
[202.97] Sometimes I am at office, sometimes
at the factory or to some meeting.
[207.28] For some work at office...
[209.05] Then just keep her in the office,
give her any petty task.
[213.11] Sister, this isn't possible at all.
[216.54] Besides, there is
all male staff in my office.
[220.61] I have even kept Zoya
away from my office,
[222.78] because this work can't be done
by girls, they can't survive there.
[226.80] -All right.
-Ask her to take some nice course.
[231.70] There is so much scope these days.
[233.79] When girls pass out with
a certificate people hire them instantly.
[238.02] Okay, let me know if you
can arrange something else.
[241.40] -All right?
-Yeah, sure. I'll try. Good bye.
[250.97] Nosheen.
[260.44] Shabana's concern over
this relationship is valid.
[263.84] I shouldn't keep her in ambiguity.
[267.40] I had hurt her once earlier as well.
[271.01] I think it's time
that I talk to Zaid about it.
[275.75] Shabana would get a definite answer too.
[316.06] Aima, I'm really scared.
[320.36] It's beating so fast, this has
never happened to me before.
[323.66] Have you told that girl that you love her?
[327.51] No.
[328.68] Means you are going
to propose that girl tomorrow
[332.34] -and introduce us to her tomorrow too?
-Yes.
[336.10] Okay, so are you going to
pick her yourself tomorrow?
[343.63] Where has he gone at this hour?
[348.34] -Durrani.
-Yes, sir?
[350.84] Come here.
[354.64] -Have you seen Zaid?
-Yes, sir, he was with Shabana madam.
[359.25] Oh, okay. Fine.
[363.26] And what did you tell her
why are you calling?
[365.61] I think she must have had an idea by now.
[369.77] -Okay.
-I don't know if she agrees or not.
[375.14] Don't worry, whatever
happens will happen for good.
[379.61] Okay, let's assume that I
tell you that I love you and
[385.60] want to marry you.
[391.06] What will be your answer then?
[395.87] Tell me what will be your answer?
[399.42] Will you marry me?
[407.89] My answer would be that you have gone mad.
[412.06] You have started joking again.
[415.77] Zaid you just asked me to assume.
[418.33] There is a lot of difference
in imagination and reality.
[424.76] We think something else,
and something else happens.
[428.62] Okay, if I am thinking that
she is going to accept my proposal,
[433.92] then according to your philosophy
it's going to be the opposite of that?
[436.62] Well, I mean that God makes it happen so
well that we have never imagined it that way.
[445.45] Aima, I feel like someone
could forward a day of life
[449.52] and tell me what is
going to happen tomorrow.
[451.90] Me too.
[453.83] You know, Aima, I can't
do anything without you.
[459.60] You are my support.
[462.40] You know, I share each and everything with
you. Every thing, every feeling, emotions.
[471.54] If you weren't there what
would have I done?
[473.54] At times I feel like I know
you even better than myself.
[478.97] Well, I know that.
[482.78] Tell me that girl's name.
[485.64] You'll get to know. It's just a matter
of few hours, then you'll know too.
[491.05] Oh, what's in just the name?
[495.40] Oh! Everything is in the name.
[499.30] Listen , groom yourself properly tomorrow.
[503.59] I've called Zoya too,
I want to make this special.
[563.45] What is it brother, you're smiling?
[567.04] Today all the ambiguities have
been removed from my mind, Shabana.
[574.08] Is it regarding Zaid?
[578.98] I am feeling pleasure for
God knows how many days.
[583.26] May God prevails your happiness.
[585.92] I'm really happy today, Shabana.
At least one of my children
[589.79] have taken the right
decision about their marriage.
[593.74] And he has chosen a girl whom he needed,
[596.72] whose character is matchless.
[599.43] Her habits are traditional
and her mentality is modern.
[604.01] I am sure Aima is going to complete Zaid.
[610.49] Have you talked to Zaid about it?
[617.04] This won't be needed.
[620.80] Anyhow I am going to make this
matter official as soon as possible.
[630.67] Brother, I can understand your
happiness about this relationship.
[638.11] And I know that your decision
is going to be right.
[644.18] But I don't know why,
[647.24] I am a little concerned
regarding this relationship.
[652.30] I can understand what you're trying to say.
[654.68] Look, brother, please don't mind.
[658.94] I have no enmity with anyone.
[662.80] Every person has
a little good and bad in him.
[666.38] But I fear that
[671.62] sister is not going to accept Aima
as the daughter in law of this family.
[674.84] Don't worry. Almas has to accept
Aima as the daughter in law of this family.
[681.55] Because prior to me, Aima is Zaid's choice.
[684.87] Zaid and Aima like each other.
[690.08] Has Zaid told this to you?
[694.68] It isn't necessary, Shabana, that
everything is expressed only by saying it.
[700.94] Nevertheless, don't worry, it's absolutely
true that they both like each other.
[707.51] You don't believe it, do you?
[710.57] Brother, if you are saying it then
there must be some reason behind it.
[716.17] It's just that I am surprised.
[720.91] I am surprised as well.
But more than that I'm happy.
[726.55] But if that's how it is,
why didn't Aima say something to me?
[733.82] She might have wanted to say something
but she couldn't because she felt shy.
[738.23] Yes, this must be the reason.
[742.44] Tell me, where are both
of these hidden geniuses?
[747.39] Both of them have gone out.
[749.88] They had some plan with friends and
they said that they are going to eat out.
[754.05] All right. Did you eat anything?
[757.67] -No, I'll eat with you.
-All right.
[761.05] Us siblings are going
to eat more in happiness.
[778.27] Don't worry, whatever
happens will happen for good.
[782.75] Okay, let's assume that I
tell you that I love you and
[788.75] want to marry you.
[791.55] What will be your answer then?
[794.43] Tell me what will be your answer?
[797.93] Will you marry me?
[805.41] My answer would be that you have gone mad.
[809.63] You have started joking again.
[813.36] Zaid you just asked me to assume.
[815.94] There is a lot of difference
in imagination and reality.
[838.03] Hello? Yeah, Zoya, I'm ready. You can come.
[867.04] Sit, sit.
[870.43] Wow!
[875.23] That girl must be so special
for whom you have brought this.
[879.65] Yeah, she is special.
[882.20] You know how difficult
it was for us to get here?
[884.92] It better be worth it.
[888.36] It will be. I promise.
[894.51] Where is the madam?
[897.30] -She is here.
-Then call her. Why are you hiding her?
[902.21] She...
[908.64] No, not right now, later.
[913.09] Listen, if you are introducing us
to the girl at least buy us dinner, right Aima?
[919.26] Shall we do that first
what we are here for? Right, Aima?
[924.16] That's what I am saying, let us meet her.
[927.30] Okay, both of you shut your eyes.
[929.70] -Seriously, Zaid?
-Do it. Shut your eyes.
[935.59] Okay, the girl whom I...
[940.63] am going to introduce you,
[943.01] you both know her already.
[946.61] She has always been with me.
[949.31] Near me.
[951.51] We have fought with
each other, laughed too.
[955.93] But we never got separated.
[959.88] -What?
-Shut your eyes and listen to the whole thing.
[967.50] The petty things she did
which irritated me,
[972.40] I never had an idea that I am going
to fall in love with those things.
[979.73] She has always been my friend.
[982.65] But when did it happen and how it happened,
[987.10] I didn't realize.
[992.34] I haven't taken this
decision being emotional,
[994.58] but I have thought
over it a lot.
[996.69] And I hope that this decision
doesn't effect our friendship.
[1018.92] Zoya! Zoya you can open your eyes now.
[1036.70] I love you, Zoya. Will you marry me?
[1050.02] I don't know what to say.
[1087.03] Zoya, you can open your eyes now.
[1089.46] I love you, Zoya. Will you marry me?
[1141.99] Why did Zoya ask for some time?
I mean doesn't she trust me?
[1157.02] Aima...
[1162.95] She would never pick up her
phone when it's something important.
[1169.92] Zaid, I think I need some time to think.
[1174.00] What does she have to think about?
[1179.52] I'm going to talk to her directly.
[1185.04] No, no.
[1188.90] She has asked for some time. Have patience.
[1191.74] I should give her time,
I should give her some privacy.
[1194.37] Some time.
[1196.82] Time.
[1199.18] Time.
[1204.11] Oh, man!
[1235.57] I haven't taken this
decision being emotional,
[1237.76] but I have thought over it a lot.
[1239.87] And I hope that this decision
doesn't effect our friendship.
[1252.97] The petty things she did
which irritated me,
[1258.14] I never had an idea that I am going
to fall in love with those things.
[1263.62] I love you, Zoya. Will you marry me?
[1269.02] What is this behaviour?
[1272.84] What's wrong, Zaid?
[1274.87] Aima, do you have any idea how
many times have I called you last night?
[1278.74] Really? Actually I just got tired
so I fell asleep. Didn't realize.
[1285.43] What's wrong, Aima.
You used to consider my problem as yours.
[1289.92] If I used to stay up all night
then you didn't sleep as well.
[1293.52] You know, I even knocked your door.
[1296.91] Really? I didn't realize.
Maybe I was in deep sleep.
[1302.83] You wake up so easily, why all of
a sudden you are having such a deep sleep.
[1308.94] Are you ignoring me?
[1310.63] No, Zaid, it's nothing like that.
[1315.28] Oh, this means you are angry with me.
[1317.83] No, I told you, it's
nothing like that, Zaid.
[1323.10] Wait a second. What's wrong with your face?
[1327.92] What's wrong?
[1331.33] What is it? It's fine.
[1333.12] No, it's not. I can clearly see
it's swollen. Were you crying?
[1339.31] Zaid, you just get after one thing.
[1343.15] I just had a little fever at night, so...
[1348.71] maybe that's the reason of swelling.
[1352.06] Why didn't you tell me this then?
[1356.95] I didn't tell you so that
you might get worried.
[1361.44] Won't I be worried now?
[1365.98] -Come here, show me how much fever you got?
-I'm fine, I checked last night.
[1371.96] Are you sure?
[1373.15] Yeah, I'm sure.
[1375.05] I took medicine last night and
maybe that's why I fell asleep
[1378.50] and I couldn't respond to your calls.
[1383.95] Silly, do you know what day it is today?
[1387.80] Yes, it's a gap day for university.
[1393.08] Really, you know?
[1394.87] Then why are you going then?
[1397.05] Ma'am Maryam has conducting
a seminar so I am going to help her.
[1404.08] Wow, just great.
[1406.09] Go ahead, help the whole world
except for him who needs you the most.
[1415.88] Really?
[1418.19] You know, I haven't slept all night.
[1421.39] I just couldn't sleep. And as soon as I
got up then I didn't feel like eating too.
[1427.70] You are waiting for
Zoya's response so much?
[1432.22] Yes, man.
[1434.30] Since she has asked for some time,
my own timing has been disturbed.
[1440.70] Zaid, why are you getting worried?
You will get your dream girl.
[1445.32] Dream girl, really?
[1448.62] The words you said to her,
the way you proposed her,
[1453.86] looking at that it seems so.
[1456.52] I mean, I mean I love her.
[1460.23] And I had this realization all of a sudden.
[1462.98] You know, when she got that proposal
and she agreed to get married,
[1465.37] I just... I just felt like...
[1471.51] I can't stay away from her and
whatever is happening is completely long.
[1478.30] Moreover, me and her have
such good understanding.
[1480.78] And I would have
eventually had to get married.
[1482.92] So I thought why not? You know, take
a chance? Marry somebody you know?
[1496.32] Okay, listen, what do you say, 
is she going to say yes?
[1503.72] What do you think?
[1506.32] To tell you the truth there
is a turmoil in my heart.
[1510.74] Sometimes I think
[1512.46] that she would say yes considering
our friendship and understanding.
[1516.72] But then I think that she might take this
point and make it the reason of saying no.
[1523.31] And I'm telling you if that happens
that it's going to be really bad.
[1526.09] Our friendship would be at stake.
[1530.46] Zaid, why are you getting worried?
[1532.33] Everything is going to be fine, 
have some patience.
[1539.38] Okay, I got to go now. I'm getting late.
[1542.70] Just one more thing, please.
[1548.21] Did I do the right thing?
[1553.10] There is nothing more honest
than what the heart tells you.
[1557.98] So you should listen to it, Zaid.
[1562.56] My heart tells me 
that I have done the right thing.
[1566.17] Then you have done the right thing.
[1571.76] *
[1592.27] Zoya, what have you decided?
[1597.69] I don't know, Mom.
[1601.31] But you have to choose one of them.
[1606.50] I made up my mind for Daniyal with such
difficulty, and now Zaid has come forward.
[1611.58] I'm so confused.
[1613.81] But you have to take a decision.
[1618.67] I need some time.
[1621.33] And I can't take a hasty decision.
[1627.11] But you have to, Zoya.
[1630.32] Just give me some time.
[1633.29] The issue is that the groom's family 
are coming tomorrow.
[1637.25] And if you opt for Zaid, then I am not
calling them just to sit at the dining table.
[1643.22] Two heroes have entered
my life at the same time.
[1647.13] Naughty girl. 
Your hero is just one of them.
[1653.43] By the way, Mom, you have met
Daniyal and obviously Zaid too.
[1657.93] If I ask you to think over it
then whose side will you be on?
[1666.41] It's going to be difficult.
[1668.50] See, I just wanted to ask you
and you have given up right away.
[1675.06] My life is in question here.
[1677.51] Actually, the problem is that
both options are very nice.
[1681.76] But still, there are so
many questions in my mind.
[1686.61] Like what?
[1688.25] Like, has Zaid taken this decision
with his family's consent?
[1693.41] And then how long will Zaid take 
to get established?
[1697.82] Then I also have doubts to get you
married in immediate family or not.
[1703.27] And for now, you and Zaid are best friends.
[1706.49] But how would be as a husband, who knows?
[1709.71] So many concerns?
[1711.88] So much is going on in my mind.
[1715.19] All of this is going on in my mind too. 
I just don't understand.
[1720.83] Mom, I'm afraid.
[1723.72] That if I reject Zaid, he might get hurt.
[1728.16] -And if I accept him then...
-Then?
[1732.07] Then what if I get hurt?
[1735.31] Do you doubt that Zaid isn't
going to keep you happy?
[1739.44] No, Mom, it's not about Zaid. 
He's my best friend.
[1744.29] I have no issues with him.
[1746.19] But you know about his family.
[1748.43] I will have to develop 
a new relationship with them.
[1753.19] And you know uncle too.
[1755.52] The rules and regulations of his house.
[1758.52] And Nosheen's habits. 
How am I going to adjust?
[1764.59] I think, I should leave
you alone for a while.
[1768.84] So that you can figure out yourself.
[1771.61] That would be better for you.
[1792.89] -I have to talk to you about something.
-Regarding what?
[1796.69] Regarding your son.
[1799.11] Is it something about Hammad?
[1803.18] I have always had much
expectations from my children
[1805.76]  but they were never able to meet them.
[1809.80] Because of which I have been 
very strict with them.
[1813.93] And I kept taking decisions 
on their behalf.
[1817.27] But whatever has happened in the
past few days, I have learned from it
[1824.37] that no matter how
useless your children are,
[1827.57] parents shouldn't take any decisions 
against their will.
[1833.37] Then they get compelled
to take some wrong step.
[1836.49] It's great that you 
have realized it yourself.
[1838.87] I have realized that everyone 
has a different way of thinking.
[1844.07] He thinks about things
with his own mind,
[1845.51] he looks at things with his own
perspective and experiences.
[1850.27] As their parents we can only guide them.
[1853.62] In the end everybody should be
independent to take his decisions.
[1857.52] Everything all right, Azmat? Are you
going to say all positive things today?
[1864.43] The thing is that a person can
move towards betterment only then
[1869.94] when he is able to accept his mistakes.
[1873.70] And to tell you the truth, 
it gives me a lot of pleasure
[1875.81] that you have started
accepting your mistakes too.
[1879.17] And correcting yourself.
[1880.23] -What mistakes are you talking about?
-No, nothing special.
[1883.48] It's just that you don't have an
objection on every other thing now
[1887.23] and I like that in you.
[1889.03] I have a lot of objections, Azmat, 
but I just keep quiet.
[1892.37] But don't consider my
silence as my acceptance.
[1895.04] I am really angry about
Aima going to your office.
[1898.52] Once again your are making
an issue of a petty thing.
[1901.35] It's not a petty thing, Azmat,
[1903.58] depriving your own child of her
rights and giving others their right,
[1907.84] is not a petty thing.
[1909.99] I don't want that whenever we sit
together we part after having a fight.
[1914.41] You have said such a thing.
[1916.31] We just drifted from the topic.
[1920.67] Actually I came to tell you a good news.
[1923.87] What good news?
[1925.54] Don't you seriously have any idea 
what I am talking about?
[1928.90] -No.
-Really? Means he hasn't told you anything?
[1935.68] -Who? Who are you talking about? Zaid?
-Yes.
[1939.60] Your son likes someone.
[1948.19] -Who's calling?
-Amber.
[1951.61] All right, take your call. 
I'll talk to you later.
[1956.56] I have to go somewhere 
for some important work, okay?
[1964.80] Really? I didn't know that.
[1977.42] Amber, why delay this noble task?
[1981.79] What do you mean?
[1984.11] I mean to say that we won't keep 
a very long engagement period.
[1990.63] I thought that when I'll propose her,
[1993.74] her reaction is going 
to be the same as it was yours.
[1998.03] What reaction?
[1999.92] When we were practicing at least you
took my proposal seriously,
[2003.85] and she started laughing, I mean seriously?
[2006.44] Nothing is okay. The kind of things going
on in this house, how can anything be okay?
[2012.51] -Why, Dad, what's wrong?
-You guys are going to tell me that.
[2016.37] Tell me one thing, Zaid. Why did
you keep such a big thing from me?
[2022.27] What are you talking about, Dad?
