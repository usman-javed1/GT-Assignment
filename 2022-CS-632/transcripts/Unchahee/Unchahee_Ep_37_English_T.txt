[0.00] From flowers and from buds
[4.54] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.13] When I saw you
[14.07] I learned how to chirp from you
[19.21] It had no effect on his father.
[21.80] He is still being stubborn,
but I won't spare him either.
[27.47] -I'll show him.
-What?
[29.07] What can you do, Mom?
[30.82] Aima, at least someone needs to talk.
[38.30] Look, it's not just him who got effected
[41.54] you have been effected
with brother's decision too.
[45.79] A huge gap has been created
between us after this incident.
[50.41] I think that we should stay
away from each other for a while.
[54.65] Aima is banking on me, you
have expectations from me too.
[58.55] Auntie's health is dependent
on me, but what about me?
[61.64] Does anybody care about me?
[65.60] You want me to be happy
and smile and accept everything
[69.88] as if nothing had happened?
[85.29] - Zoya.
- Why are you standing? Sit down.
[94.47] Thank you.
[96.29] So, how is your and Zaid's life going on?
[101.28] The way that you can't even imagine.
[104.66] Obviously.
[106.51] Si, there must be no
hurdle for you both now.
[110.72] You both must be very
happy with your lives.
[113.64] By the way why are you here?
To invite me for you valima?
[118.03] Why are you saying all this, Zoya?
[121.27] Why would I hurt you? You're my friend.
[123.81] Enough, Aima. I'm your
friend, why would I hurt you?
[127.32] Don't you get tired of saying all that?
[131.61] Say whatever you want and then leave.
[135.47] Zoya, I haven't come here
to talk to you about myself.
[138.36] I'm here to talk to you about Zaid.
[140.48] What's the difference? You talk about
yourself or Zaid, it's the same thing.
[146.06] Zaid has met an accident., Zoya.
[153.78] So?
[155.03] He is badly injured. He needs you.
[159.30] He doesn't need me but the doctor.
[161.77] He'll get better if he gets
treatment from a good place.
[164.52] Then you both can live happily together.
[168.84] Zoya, what you are thinking isn't right.
[171.22] His happiness has left
since you have left him.
[176.81] Zoya, he is in a really bad shape.
[181.75] Apparently he has many injuries
but from within he is broken.
[186.92] He needs you to stay alive,
he needs your presence.
[191.30] Aima, you know what?
Just leave all this right now
[195.63] because it won't effect me any more.
[199.62] Please , Zoya, he loves you
so much, he is going to die.
[203.69] Nobody dies without anyone.
[208.22] He is punishing himself.
[210.52] Wow.
[212.23] Committing a crime himself and
then punishing himself too, just great.
[216.17] I just don't believe it.
[221.23] Okay, fine, just come with me
and see his condition.
[225.39] Aima, what's done is done.
[227.62] And it' better to live your lives happily
together, what do you have to do with me?
[234.15] What life, Zoya?
Which life are you talking about?
[238.63] A life where he makes me realise
everyday that I mean nothing to him.
[246.14] He doesn't let me close to him
even as a friend let alone like a wife.
[251.53] He doesn't talk to me, he
doesn't even want to look at me.
[257.83] What you have imagined is wrong.
[260.77] Relationships aren't made
just by signing a paper.
[263.31] There is no relation between me and Zaid.
[267.07] There is an agreement between me and him.
[269.42] An agreement which
we both were compelled to make.
[273.45] Believe me.
[276.14] If it weren't for my mother
I would never have done all this.
[280.68] I would have accepted
what was written in my fate.
[285.69] Aima, you are legally his wife .
[288.23] And knowing this fact it is
really difficult for me to accept it.
[294.81] You know what I mean.
[297.58] Zoya, it doesn't matter to
him if I am in his life or not.
[302.35] It's only you who is important for him.
[305.10] He loves you.
[307.44] Please don't do this to him.
[310.05] Save you relationship.
[312.54] Because if anything happens to Zaid
I will never be able to forgive myself.
[318.75] You know what, Aima?
[320.69] You are legally his wife and
knowing that you are a part of his life,
[326.31] I can't tolerate that,
nor can I ever will.
[334.08] Okay, fine. I will not use any of my
rights even after being Zaid's wife.
[343.34] I promise you that.
[346.38] Please, just let me...
[349.38] let me live in your house.
[354.24] I will remain in your life and your
house like some old thing lying around.
[361.07] Please.
[362.99] Zaid is just yours and he will
remains yours I promise you that.
[368.51] Please, say yes, Zoya.
[390.01] I'm really sorry, Zoya.
[393.77] For what?
[398.52] Look, Zaid, it's not your fault, okay?
[403.51] Stop blaming yourself.
[405.98] And besides if you are going to lose
hope, who is going to take care of Aima?
[412.99] She depends on us so much.
[416.04] I will have to support Aima, Zoya.
[418.84] That's what I'm saying, that
only you have to support her.
[423.65] I know.
[426.48] That's why I'll have to marry her.
[439.84] I'm filing a case on Zaid.
[442.14] He is going to come back to his senses
after spending some time in the lock up.
[447.26] What case?
[448.92] Well, he has given you
mental torture right after
[453.31] and married again without your consent.
[473.94] -Put all the vegetables away carefully.
-Greetings, Mom.
[479.53] -Greetings.
-Faiq was telling me that you went for groceries.
[485.14] I would have helped you had I been home.
[488.14] I would have gone with you.
[491.58] Nosheen, I always go for groceries alone.
[494.26] Anyway, I came to know that Zaid
had an accident, how is he doing now?
[499.00] What can I say, Mom?
[500.89] He is in a bad shape since few days.
[503.57] Few days? But he had
an accident just today.
[508.20] That's due to so much stress.
Otherwise my brother drives very safely.
[513.84] Stress? What kind of stress?
[516.17] Obviously, Dad has burdened him
more than he could handle.
[522.68] What are you saying? What kind of burden?
[525.32] - Actually, Mom, I was talking about Aima...
- My niece isn't a burden on anyone.
[532.21] In fact she is a blessing
in your brother's life.
[536.76] - Yeah I was just...
- Nosheen, I'm still talking.
[544.06] The girl whom you are calling a burden,
[547.67] she is going to make
your mother's house a heaven.
[552.09] Only if you people are going to value her.
[554.11] Mom, I know that Aima
has got qualities,
[557.35] it just slipped out of my mouth
because I am a bit worried.
[561.48] Yeah, sure, it's obvious how much
you are worried about your brother.
[570.73] Tell your family to value Aima.
[573.77] Those who don't regret it later.
[576.59] And no one knows it better than me.
[588.44] Old woman, Aima's flatterer.
[609.00] Where is Aima?
[611.23] She has gone to Zaid,
to give him breakfast.
[614.36] That's nice, she should take care of Zaid.
[624.26] Shabana, these relationships
are very fragile.
[629.34] Just like an innocent bird.
[632.84] If you hold them with force,
they die in your hands.
[637.66] If you hold them loosely, they fly away.
[641.16] You have to take care
of them with loving hands.
[644.20] Only then they work.
[646.56] Yes.
[651.51] Yeah, it's okay.
[655.34] You seem a lot better now.
[658.76] I don't feel like it though.
[660.50] You'll feel it with passage of time.
[663.28] Here, have your breakfast then
you have to take your medicine too.
[672.14] Zoya, you're back!
[679.04] Why? Don't you like it that I'm back?
[683.28] No, it's nothing like that.
In fact I'm really happy to see you.
[688.30] You are serving Zaid
with a lot of devotion.
[692.80] Yeah, he wasn't able to do his
tasks so I was just taking care of him.
[698.55] You weren't here as well.
[700.01] And you thought of making
the most of the opportunity, right?
[711.59] And you.
[715.70] How are you doing?
[717.88] I wasn't okay, but now that
you are here, I think I'll be fine.
[730.07] Zoya, sit down.
[733.38] Yeah.
[739.54] Why don't you feed him his breakfast?
[744.71] Aima,
[747.66] please give me some time,
I need to talk to Zoya.
[752.40] Yeah, sure,
[753.35] just remember to take your medicine
when you are done with your breakfast.
[762.69] Zoya,
[765.24] I missed you so much.
[768.34] So much.
[771.45] I heard that you had an accident.
[775.08] Yeah, I did.
[778.65] But you know,
[780.81] the pain due the that accident is nothing
[783.78] compared to the pain it
caused me to be away from you.
[787.89] Honestly, Zoya, I can't live
without you, please believe me.
[792.84] Have your breakfast, it's getting cold.
[817.43] I promise you that.
[820.45] Please, just let me...
[823.39] let me live in your house.
[828.32] I will be in your life and in your
house just like an old thing lying around.
[835.28] Please.
[837.01] Zaid is just yours and he will
stay yours, I promise you that.
[846.70] Did Zaid talk to you?
[849.83] Did he say anything?
[852.68] No.
[853.54] -Did he?
-He didn't come to my room.
[860.68] And even if he did, what
would have he said to me?
[864.89] That he is indebted
[867.95] that I have destroyed
his happily married life?
[872.79] Why are you thinking like that?
[874.90] What should I think then?
Haven't I committed a sin?
[882.38] Your disagreement is valid.
[884.92] Had I been at your place
I would have done the same.
[889.18] I have an idea how much I have hurt
you, how much pain I have caused you.
[895.39] But please believe me,
I'm going through the same agony.
[899.80] You have caused this agony to yourself.
[903.40] If it were in a person's hand he would
never hurt himself and his loved ones.
[908.34] Just because of this decision of yours, \
everyone has got hurt.
[914.73] Whatever there was between us
[916.93] love, trust, friendship,
[921.37] you have ended it all, Zaid.
[922.87] It hasn't ended, Zoya, I'm going
to make everything all right.
[928.36] I'll make everything like it was before.
[930.24] You are mistaken here,
nothing can become as it was before.
[940.27] This new relationship
has ruined everything.
[943.16] Neither previous relations
nor previous attachments,
[946.54] nothing can be repaired.
[948.28] Don't say that, Zoya, you have no idea
how much I missed you.
[952.06] Please.
[956.58] I beg you, just don't say that.
[961.60] I love you yesterday, today,
and I will always love you.
[968.10] And Aima? What about her?
[973.15] Will you be unfair to him?
[975.71] Won't you give her rights to her?
[978.98] She is your wife now as well.
[980.43] - Yeah, but there is nothing in my heart for her...
- Don't you tell me that you don't love her.
[984.67] Because I know that you
love her very much, Zaid.
[991.10] The feelings don't change
with the situations.
[996.22] I have never been
through so much problems in my life.
[999.47] I think I am going to break down.
[1005.48] But one thing is clear, Zoya,
[1008.72] I can't live without you.
[1013.14] Only I know how every moment,
every hour that I have spent without you.
[1018.91] I swear if you hadn't come back then...
[1021.60] I would have died.
[1023.96] I just couldn't bear it.
[1026.14] I couldn't take it.
[1029.44] Your sorrow, your pain. Did you ever
think what trauma I have been through?
[1034.56] I know, I know, Zoya. I was worried about
you all the time. I tried to contact you.
[1042.49] I tried my best to let
you know what I feel but...
[1047.10] Your wife is here to take care of you.
[1049.91] Your anger is valid, Zoya.
[1052.44] Do whatever you like,
swear at me, scold me,
[1058.38] in fact I won't have any objection
even if you are going to kill me.
[1063.44] I'm telling the truth, Zoya.
[1066.30] Do whatever you want but
please don't leave me again.
[1072.28] I can't live without you.
[1073.80] The sorrows that I have draped myself with
Are burning my body
[1083.23] I have learned to burn
By looking at the fire.
[1091.62] Why did I become unwanted
[1096.27] Nobody knows that.
[1100.87] Even you don't know it
Just my God knows it
[1129.38] Whenever I think of getting apart from you
I get scared
[1138.23] I don't need anyone.
[1140.26] Whatever happened, what's going to happen
in future, I'm responsible for that myself.
[1143.27] Stop being so stubborn.
Till when is this going to go on?
[1149.70] You have been like this since a week.
[1154.17] You should keep in mind that you aren't
just hurting yourself but all of us as well.
[1157.64] I haven't hurt anyone, Aima, nor
anybody needs to worry about me.
[1162.62] How can we not worry about you?
[1165.46] You are very important for us.
[1182.89] Really?
[1189.56] I was telling you all this is just
a drama, and it won't last long.
[1194.35] Okay, fine, I'll talk to you in a while.
[1197.41] Okay bye.
[1199.56] - Who were you talking to?
- It was mama.
[1202.91] Okay, how is Zaid doing?
[1207.01] Doctor has told him to avoid movement.
[1211.18] He has asked him for bed rest.
[1213.78] I think he is badly hurt.
[1220.59] Faiq, I was thinking
that I should go see Zaid.
[1225.88] Yeah, you should.
[1228.53] Well then let's go together.
[1230.54] I'm calling mama to tell he
that we'll come tonight for dinner.
[1234.02] No, I was saying just like that.
[1237.74] What do you mean just like that?
What's the problem in that?
[1241.34] What are you talking about, Nosheen?
[1243.35] Don't you remember how he held my
collar at the wedding day?
[1249.16] And nothing has changed right now.
[1254.33] It's over Faiq, till when
are you going to hold this grudge?
[1259.16] Look, this is not something small.
[1261.23] And I feel really ashamed
going in front of them all.
[1265.06] Come on, people get away
after doing what not,
[1267.96] and you are blaming yourself by
just marrying with your own choice?
[1271.07] If anybody misbehaves with me there,
I will be offended.
[1274.62] Zaid is your brother in law, and who
would dare to misbehave with you?
[1280.17] Nosheen, I think this is not the
right time so please, don't force me.
[1285.65] - Okay just listen.
- Hurry up I'm going to take a shower.
[1288.98] Look at this, my friend Farri. She has
gone to visit Maldives with her husband.
[1294.27] - Yeah, so?
- Look how beautiful is that place.
[1297.49] -Yeah it is.
-She was telling me that it is very safe for tourists.
[1302.39] Nosheen, why are you telling me all this?
I already know that.
[1307.75] You... just forget it.
[1310.31] All right. Why do you get angry?
[1314.33] I'm showing you these pictures so
that you think about our honeymoon.
[1318.63] Otherwise why would I show you
someone else's pictures?
[1322.01] Okay, we will go but
it's not the right time.
[1326.62] Why? What's wrong?
[1328.81] I mean, just look
at the situations.
[1331.06] Mom, is angry with me, there are
problems going on in your house too.
[1334.38] So how can we relax in
some other country like this?
[1337.91] We can do it, Faiq because
we are not responsible for others.
[1343.70] Nosheen, these aren't strangers.
It's our family which is unhappy with us.
[1351.03] Faiq, it doesn't make any
difference to anyone even if we stay here.
[1354.26] Till when are you going
to suppress yourself?
[1355.74] That's why to hell with
everyone and just enjoy life.
[1361.76] Look, Faiq, nobody is happy with
anyone even if we give our lives for them.
[1367.06] I have just one principle in my life.
Live your life and to hell with others.
[1372.13] Do you get what I'm saying?
[1374.72] Only we should be important for each other.
[1382.95] I'm going to my room.
[1403.83] Zoya,
[1406.49] where were you?
[1410.73] I went for something important.
[1413.75] I know very well what
important work was it.
[1417.01] Mom, please, I am not
in the mood right now.
[1419.74] Why are you doing all this, Zoya?
[1424.49] Mom, I told you, I don't want
to talk about anything.
[1428.43] You can't leave until you answer me.
[1432.69] Don't you have any sense?
[1434.56] Anybody would come and blackmail
you emotionally and you would follow him?
[1441.52] You forgot everything what he did with you?
[1447.15] Do you remember what they have done
to you, or should I remind you?
[1451.39] I remember.
[1452.71] And you still went to his home?
[1455.78] I didn't know
[1457.23] that after getting married to that , you
are going to lose your self respect too.
[1464.06] Try to recognize your rights, dear.
[1466.69] This is a world of wolves.
[1470.62] People are ready to prey
on innocent people like you.
[1474.44] You are spending your life in a delusion.
[1478.06] Should I tell you what's
going on in your head?
[1481.94] You still think that
Aima is your well-wisher
[1487.27] and Zaid loves you a lot.
[1489.93] - Mom, he really loves me a lot.
- For God's sake, Zoya,
[1496.27] all this love and affection is useless.
[1502.81] If someone loves you so much he
wouldn't have humiliated you like that.
[1512.37] Mom, please stop torturing me. Please.
[1516.21] I'm torturing you? Me?
[1520.45] And your husband, and that Aima,
your best friend, what did they do to you?
[1527.33] Mom, can you please leave me alone?
[1530.44] I don't want to talk about it.
[1534.55] Zoya, you can't do this.
[1536.92] -I won't let you do it, do you hear me?
-No!
[1560.85] Faiq, ain't I looking nice?
[1563.95] Yeah, you're looking nice.
[1568.57] Obviously, you didn't like me for nothing.
[1572.62] By the way, where are you going?
[1576.52] I was thinking that we
should go somewhere out today.
[1580.59] Let's get some food from a nice
restaurant and go to the beach.
[1585.58] Nosheen, I don't remember one day after our
marriage when we didn't go out and eat.
[1595.04] I think we should take a break.
[1599.12] Please, Faiq.
[1601.47] Look, all things can't happen
according to you all the time.
[1606.22] Besides, I have to go to
the restaurant from tomorrow,
[1608.07] take care of all the arrangements, and in
fact I am busy with them right now as well.
[1612.97] But it's your own business, 
tell the manager, he'll manage.
[1622.19] What are you talking about?
[1626.32] In a business an owner has to invest
more of his time than the employs.
[1630.83] And you should be aware of all that,
after all you are a businessman's daughter.
[1635.41] You'll go at work from tomorrow
and I'll get bored at home alone.
[1640.04] Well then don't sit idle, 
you won't be bored then.
[1643.32] What do you mean?
[1645.14] I mean that you should take
responsibilities in the house.
[1651.14] What responsibilities are
you talking about, Faiq?
[1654.50] Means, responsibilities
regarding this home.
[1659.32] Looking after the kitchen, cook,
what housewives usually do, what else?
[1663.35] But, mama does all these things.
[1666.77] She does, but you should help her.
[1672.30] In fact, I think we
should let her rest now.
[1675.34] You should take care of
the responsibilities now.
[1677.44] - Faiq, we have just been married.
- So what?
[1682.05] What would my family think?
[1684.19] I just got married and got
busy with chores right away.
[1687.39] They won't think anything, Nosheen.
[1689.62] I'm not asking you to plough a field.
[1691.63] I'm asking you to do house
chores which every woman does.
[1694.94] So should I work all day long?
[1697.77] No, manage your time. Do
your chores along with enjoyment.
[1701.91] Besides, it won't be too difficult for you
with just three people in this house.
[1706.45] Yeah, that's true but...
[1709.75] But what?
[1712.94] Actually, I'm not used to do so much work.
so can't we hire a maid?
[1721.34] No, not a maid. Mom may not like it.
[1727.71] Because she likes to do everything herself.
[1731.05] And she had planned that
when her daughter in law comes
[1734.24] she will hand over all
the responsibilities to her.
[1738.91] And now is the time to
take over the responsibilities.
[1742.59] Besides, it's nice, this way you'll get 
a chance to help mom and get close to her.
[1747.98] May be she can forgive her because of that.
[1750.83] Yeah, but you mom doesn't
even like to talk to me.
[1756.22] Tell me, how much effort did
you put in to talk to her,
[1760.44] to know her, to get close to her?
[1765.29] Nosheen, marriage doesn't
mean that one has fun all the time,
[1769.01] move around and go places.
[1772.85] It involves taking care of 
the relatives and family members too.
[1776.55] You have to take everything along.
[1780.44] Be serious.
[1783.92] Please ask them to get me a cup of tea.
[1807.14] I swear, never again.
[1809.68] I will never take any
decision that hurts you.
[1813.54] Nor will I let anybody
make such a decision.
[1817.53] It's a promise and I won't let it break.
[1821.28] He got very upset when Zoya left.
[1824.56] He was like that for everyone.
[1828.81] Now that she is back, 
he will accept you too.
[1832.20] Not only as a friend, 
but as a wife as well.
[1836.19] You should have been to
your in laws on your way back then.
[1839.79] - Why?
- Because your wife has gone there.
[1847.34] Do you actually want that
we become sisters again?
[1851.12] - Yeah, Amber, of course.
- It's possible on one condition only
[1857.03] that you remove Aima from Zoya's way.
