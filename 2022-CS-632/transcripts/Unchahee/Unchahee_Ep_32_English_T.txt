[0.00] From flowers and from buds
[4.57] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.16] When I saw you
[14.32] I learned to chirp from you
[18.78] Is everything all right?
[20.51] Yeah, everything is fine.
[22.82] He must be busy with his business.
[25.25] I'm sure he'll call me when he is free.
[28.77] Don't you have any manners?
Why are you checking my phone?
[32.18] Why is Faiq sending you messages?
[34.14] Mind your own business.
[35.87] Nosheen I'm your elder brother,
I have the right to know.
[39.40] Aima, I think you
are hiding something from me.
[42.10] Why would I hide anything from you?
[44.10] I have noticed that you have been
very disturbed through out the wedding.
[48.08] And I didn't find it normal.
[50.43] What's wrong with you?
[53.09] Nothing.
[55.31] Zaid, look at her eyes.
[57.97] Mom, how are you feeling?
[62.92] Dear, I feel great.
[67.65] It seems as if
a long awaited wish is fulfilled today.
[75.12] Thank God I have
completed my responsibility today.
[83.13] I...
[86.10] I really feel wonderful today, wonderful.
[91.25] Aima, dear,
[95.28] I am so happy today,
[97.88] Why do you seem sad then?
[100.72] No, not at all.
[103.74] And don't you ever get sad too.
[107.95] And I'm sure
[110.63] even if you get sad
[113.45] then Faiq won't let you stay sad for long.
[122.89] Shabana, you're here and I've
been looking for you for so long.
[126.92] -Yes, brother?
-Your guests are here.
[129.91] Yeah, I was just coming outside.
[134.61] Aima, dear,
[137.88] are you ready?
[141.89] Yes, Dad.
[143.23] We have to take you out now,
the cleric is here.
[146.51] Come.
[213.63] My child, she is looking so pretty.
[218.36] May God save you from evil eyes.
[221.08] Zaid, did you check up on the catering guy?
I hope everything is fine.
[225.04] Yeah, Dad, I talked to him,
everything is perfect.
[227.66] Just make sure nobody has any
problem, it's a matter of our reputation.
[231.88] Relax, Dad, calm down.
I am in touch with everyone.
[234.21] Okay, fine.
[239.72] -Where is Faiq?
-I think he has gone to attend an urgent call.
[245.15] Oh, okay.
[246.25] Mr. Azmat please call the groom so that
we can start the solemnizing the marriage.
[249.70] Sure, I'll just call him.
[251.59] Please go and see, tell him the cleric is calling him.
[278.59] What's going on here?
[287.39] What's wrong? Is his
cell phone switched off?
[289.70] No, it's ringing but he isn't picking up.
[302.56] It's been quite some time,
please call the groom now.
[305.74] Please wait for a while, I have sent Zaid.
Yeah, so?
[310.06] Dad, I have looked for him
everywhere but I couldn't find Faiq.
[312.69] Couldn't find him? What do you mean?
[314.46] I don't think he is here.
[318.88] You all have to come with me.
[325.16] What do you mean come with you? The marriage
ceremony is about to take place here.
[327.96] I'm telling you all to come with me.
[333.19] Come with me.
[344.29] Zoya, what's going on?
Where has everyone gone?
[349.88] I don't know, they have gone inside.
[351.88] I think auntie needs to talk to
them about something important.
[354.41] Okay, just don't worry. It must be
something, I don't know about it right now.
[359.32] Zoya, I'm really anxious about Faiq.
[366.26] I'm very worried.
[368.31] He must be here somewhere, just
don't worry. Your make up will spoil.
[373.84] How an I not worry, Zoya?
[376.61] Whatever it is, is related to my marriage.
[379.85] Just call Zaid and ask what is wrong.
[382.16] Call him, quickly.
[383.92] How can everyone leave like that?
[392.10] Dial once more.
[396.02] He is disconnecting.
[399.61] Zoya, the way auntie has called
everyone, I think it's bad news.
[405.54] And I'm worried about
mom, she is so weak-hearted.
[409.80] -I'm really worried.
-Calm down, why are you thinking so negatively?
[413.70] Everything is going to be fine.
[417.09] -Please call Zaid.
-Yeah, I'm calling. Relax, relax.
[424.13] Faiq, tell everyone what the truth is.
[429.05] Don't look at her, look at me and answer.
[431.92] Tell me honestly,
what have you done to her?
[437.26] Please, let me talk to him.
[441.91] Faiq, tell right now in front of
everyone what is it all about?
[448.63] Tell them Faiq how much you love me.
[451.42] Tell them that you used to come
and meet me by ignoring Aima.
[454.49] Tell them that we have met
privately at your place and at my place.
[458.75] What nonsense is she saying?
Tell us honestly.
[461.51] He is not as innocent as much
he seems. Tell what the truth is.
[465.23] Zaid, back off.
[466.78] Faiq, say that all of it is a lie.
[469.79] The reality won't change even
if he says it, auntie. He was...
[472.65] Shut up! Just shut up.
[475.78] I know who is telling
the truth here and who is lying.
[479.34] Don't you dare utter a single word anymore.
[483.32] Sister Nimra, I'm sorry.
[486.01] I know what the reality is and all this
drama has been created by my daughter.
[490.22] I'm well aware of her nature.
[494.25] Faiq has no fault.
[495.49] What are you saying?
[497.64] Shut up, if you say
a single word then I'm going to...
[507.60] Zaid isn't picking up my phone.
[511.92] Everyone is looking
at me with strange eyes, Zoya.
[515.31] More than half of the guests
have left already.
[518.63] Aima, I don't understand what's going on.
[522.70] Why don't you ask auntie? Go, ask her.
[526.37] Mama, doesn't know herself what's going on.
[529.57] Everybody is waiting for the marriage
ceremony outside, we're getting late.
[532.75] What kind of a father are you?
[534.39] Aren't you ashamed to accuse
your daughter in front of everyone?
[537.05] I am ashamed, but not on me
but on this daughter of yours.
[541.44] You know her reality very well too.
She hasn't done this for the first time.
[545.24] -Are you done talking or is there anything else left?
-Nosheen! Don't you have any shame?
[549.98] Zaid, Zaid there is no use doing all this.
[553.22] Don't you even think about it. Enough
of your father and son's oppression.
[557.52] Mama, I know why he is getting so
angry because he knows that dad is lying.
[562.31] He is accusing me falsely.
[564.01] Why don't you tell dad
whom you saw me with?
[567.02] Who sent me messages on my phone?
[568.73] I know you are lying.
Dad, is absolutely right.
[573.09] All this is your conspiracy.
[575.03] Zoya, how long are they
going to take? See how late it is.
[580.40] Mama, we don't know
ourselves what's going on inside.
[583.27] And I was calling Zaid
but he isn't answering.
[586.75] But what is it that they
need to discuss right now?
[589.54] People are saying all sorts
of things, this isn't right.
[593.30] Look, sister, the time
for the ceremony has passed.
[596.22] Please let me know what should I do?
[597.93] Please wait for a little while,
they'll be here any moment.
[600.37] Yes, please wait for a while.
I'll go and see what's wrong.
[604.29] I'm coming with you.
[636.63] Please, at least you tell the truth.
[640.47] Tell the truth before it's too late.
[644.38] I don't understand what I should say.
[647.19] What do you mean, Faiq?
Is this all a joke going on here?
[654.06] Dad, everyone is waiting outside.
[656.63] Now stop all this drama.
[660.42] Everybody come outside
for the ceremony quietly, I'm going.
[663.71] No one is going anywhere.
[665.81] I'm going to make you all hear myself.
[673.57] Listen to this.
[674.12] I accept that I like you.
But I can't get married to you.
[680.35] -So are you compelled to marry Aima?
-You can say that.
[685.69] Look, I've been under pressure
to marry Aima since long.
[689.52] Nosheen, I've started loving you too.
[694.44] I enjoy your company. If you
aren't with me I start missing you.
[698.90] But, I can't do it.
[702.64] I don't have the courage to elope with you.
[712.01] -Auntie, get hold of your self, auntie.
-Move away.
[717.13] -Shabana, Shabana.
-Go, get some water.
[719.70] -Shabana.
-Shabana.
[728.07] Come on, Shabana,
have some water and take your medicine.
[730.88] If you won't get well how are we
going to carry on with this wedding?
[736.27] Brother,
[738.44] how will this wedding
going to take place anyways?
[740.81] What are you talking about, Shabana?
This wedding is going to take place.
[744.91] And Faiq and Aima are going to get married.
[747.87] -I will talk to Faiq.
-Talk to him?
[753.53] What are you going to say to him now?
[757.18] And what Faiq has said that
we all heard, what about that?
[764.22] Try to understand,
this is all a game set by Nosheen.
[767.91] You know that she is prone to
conspire. She has trapped Faiq.
[771.47] And she is done all this
to belittle him in front of us.
[774.99] Don't you know her nature?
You know it very well.
[777.99] Look, please, I'm telling you,
[780.66] if Aima is going to get
married she will marry only Faiq.
[783.54] Shabana, he is absolutely right.
And I'm Faiq's mother.
[791.04] Who else can know
her child better than a mother.
[793.85] If there was something like it, Faiq
would have definitely mentioned it to me.
[797.35] But he didn't say anything.
[800.78] Shabana, trust me, Faiq likes Aima.
[805.59] I haven't forced him at all.
[809.46] Yes, I expressed my wish in front of him.
[813.80] But he likes Aima.
[818.16] And brother, with due apology,
[821.13] I have often noticed Nosheen
trying to get close to Faiq.
[824.92] There is no need to apologize.
[827.67] I know that it's true.
[829.04] See, he is saying that too.
[832.36] Trust me, Faiq and Aima
are going to get married today.
[836.99] Come on, take this pill,
take the glass, I'll talk to Faiq.
[842.01] And after taking your pill, come outside.
[845.13] There is already been a scene created.
[847.11] Have it.
[848.65] No, brother Azmat, please
go and attend the guests,
[852.55] I'm going to talk to Faiq.
[854.14] -And believe me he is not going to say no.
-Okay.
[858.62] I just have one request from you.
Please tell Almas and Nosheen to stop.
[864.79] The time to tell them to stop has passed.
[866.09] Had they been so intelligent they
wouldn't have done such a thing.
[870.10] I'm going to handle them my way. Let's go.
[875.75] Just get hold of yourself and
come with me downstairs. Get up.
[879.91] -Brother, what if Aima...
-She doesn't know about it at all.
[884.05] And for God's sake,
don't you even mention it in front of her.
[886.71] or else she would get disheartened
before the marriage. Come on.
[890.79] So you guys are still lying to yourself
[892.94] and you have unheard the truth
even after hearing it yourself?
[896.88] You are a liar, you and
your daughter are a liar.
[901.58] How else can you respond
other than cursing Nosheen.
[906.02] But she is telling the truth.
[909.13] Almas go away from here
[911.24] or else something might happen that
you are going to regret it all your life.
[914.22] Move away from here.
[915.41] I am not going to get
scared of your threats now.
[917.88] I'm not going to let anybody
be unfair to Nosheen.
[922.20] And Nimra, you were just
talking about asking Faiq, right?
[925.51] I just met him and he
has admitted it himself
[928.32] that he wants to marry Nosheen.
[929.98] Shut your mouth or else...
[931.96] I am not going to get
threatened by you anymore.
[937.45] You cannot suppress my voice now.
[939.99] If any one is going to get married
today that will be my daughter and Faiq.
[943.70] And if that doesn't happen
I am going to strangle her myself.
[958.91] Aima, just get hold of
yourself. Just be normal.
[962.99] Besides, whatever Nosheen
is saying, it's nothing like that.
[965.82] She doesn't fins peace
until she does something like this.
[970.26] Besides, what difference does it make?
She is a liar and everyone knows that.
[975.82] Nimra auntie has gone to talk
to your mom. So just be normal.
[982.27] Aima, Aima.
[987.72] Zaid, I didn't get married.
[997.46] Aima, Aima look at me.
[1002.15] Aima, just look here. I promise I won't
let anything wrong happen with you.
[1006.93] Do you listen?
[1009.56] Neither Faiq can't do anything,
nor will I let Nosheen do anything.
[1018.74] Don't worry, everything
is going to be back to normal.
[1038.66] You have humiliated me
in front of everyone.
[1041.99] Am I left with any respect?
[1045.84] That girl kept telling lie
and you were just listening quietly?
[1050.72] Tell me, was that recording real?
[1056.18] Have you been actually
meeting her privately?
[1058.85] Been Talking to her secretly?
[1062.44] Tell me, Faiq, I want to
know the truth from you.
[1068.16] That's true, Mom.
[1072.59] I don't like Aima but Nosheen,
and I want to marry Nosheen only.
[1076.94] And you are telling this to me now?
[1080.63] When you have come here
with everyone to marry Aima?
[1085.71] Faiq, you have disgraced me.
[1089.83] I have just promised Shabana and
Azmat that my son won't let me down.
[1098.20] You have been deceiving me.
[1103.06] If you didn't like Aima
you should have told me.
[1107.77] I would have said no to the proposal.
[1111.10] At least that girl's life wouldn't
have been ruined like this.
[1115.87] You have no idea what the consequences
of what you have done would be.
[1120.85] Just imagine, Faiq, what Aima
must be going through right now.
[1124.78] What's wrong, Faiq?
Why are you sitting quietly?
[1128.24] Why aren't you responding to
the allegations by Nosheen on you?
[1131.47] I have told mom what I had to say,
I have given my response.
[1134.07] Say it in front of everyone.
[1137.30] What are you going to respond.
[1139.47] I know that Nosheen's allegations
aren't false but true.
[1143.66] And I also know that you didn't go to
the restaurant that day for a business meeting
[1147.51] but you went with Nosheen,
and still I kept quiet.
[1150.44] I kept quiet because
I couldn't see Aima in pain.
[1154.03] But I don't like Aima but Nosheen.
[1156.24] I don't care what you want.
[1159.15] If you have committed marriage with
Aima, then you have to marry Aima.
[1164.33] Got it?
[1165.62] This is not going to happen.
[1166.90] My daughter will never go to a
place where she is unwanted.
[1174.15] Aima won't be able to take it.
[1177.46] If Faiq likes Nosheen, then
they both are going to get married.
[1181.27] Try to understand this is
going to be unfair to Aima.
[1183.63] It is very important for a boy and
girl to like each other to get married.
[1188.34] And because Faiq like Nosheen then
Faiq and Nosheen are going to get married.
[1219.88] I know very well what agony
you are going through right now.
[1227.11] Or maybe I am unable to feel your pain.
[1233.21] I am really sorry.
[1237.19] So much that I can't
even look at you in the eye.
[1245.35] If it were in my hands I would
never have let you get hurt like this.
[1251.12] Believe me, Shabana.
[1254.93] I feel so helpless.
[1259.97] May be this is what God wanted.
[1262.47] My daughter,
[1265.72] my daughter must be in so much pain.
[1275.21] She won't get married.
[1280.85] Her marriage is going to be called off
[1283.50] Just be patient, Shabana.
[1286.76] Look, this is God's will,
and may be this is better for her.
[1292.41] Her marriage is going to be called off
right before it was supposed to happen.
[1301.48] Who is going to marry my daughter now?
[1311.25] What if she has to pay
for this day all her life.
[1320.18] A girl whose marriage gets called off
[1325.73] nobody accepts her then.
[1332.74] Nobody accepts her.
[1336.77] I'm afraid that
[1341.10] that even worse might
happen to my daughter.
[1348.19] Even worse might happen to her.
[1351.39] God forbid, Shabana, what are you saying?
[1357.27] Look, hope for the best from God.
[1360.29] Have patience and courage,
everything is going to be fine.
[1364.37] Patience?
[1367.52] Patience?
[1370.12] Where should I get patience from? Tell me.
[1374.28] How can I be patient? Please tell me how?
[1379.35] I won't be able to see my daughter's pain.
[1383.61] I won't be able to bear it.
[1387.52] How can I have patience?
[1389.77] How can I? How can I have patience?
[1396.24] I won't be able to watch her pain.
[1407.88] Oh God! How can uncle
take such a wrong decision?
[1412.44] This is unfair with Aima.
This is wrong, Zaid.
[1416.85] At least you should have
said something to him.
[1419.85] Zaid, Zaid! I'm talking to you.
Do something.
[1425.74] What can I do? I have nothing in my hands.
[1432.88] What's happening is unfair with Aima.
[1436.78] Uncle isn't doing right to her.
[1438.89] What else can dad do when that
cheap person has denied to marry her.
[1446.35] Can anyone be married by force?
[1449.73] I can't face Aima.
[1452.76] I don't know what to do.
[1455.70] I had promised her.
[1458.53] What am I going to say to her?
[1462.84] What nonsense is going on outside?
[1465.45] You know guys, Faiq and
Nosheen are getting married.
[1474.18] Zoya, this is so cruel with that girl.
[1479.72] Do you guys even know
[1481.63] how difficult it is for the girls to get
married whose wedding is called off.
[1491.65] Zoya, I swear that girl is going
to become a laughing-stock.
[1498.21] People are going to say all sorts of
things and think whatever they want.
[1502.06] Have sister and Nosheen
even thought about it for once?
[1509.06] Zaid,
[1513.53] uncle is calling you outside.
[1525.81] Zoya, I could never imagine that
Nosheen could go to this extent.
[1534.03] This girl has crossed all limits.
[1537.57] I feel like breaking that girl's jaw.
[1543.91] Seriously, Zoya, if I
had the slightest of idea,
[1547.66] I would never have
married you in this family.
[1550.25] I had no idea that this house is ruined.
[1554.17] Mom, at least consider the situation
which is going on before you speak.
[1558.21] You just go on and on.
[1560.82] Listen to me carefully, Zoya,
[1563.35] just stay away from
these mother and daughter.
[1568.11] She may be my sister, but today I
have seen how her upbringing is.
[1572.81] I feel so sorry.
[1577.61] Just listen carefully,
[1581.81] no one is going to take your
decision for you other than yourself.
[1586.01] Even if it is brother Azmat.
I'm never going to tolerate it.
[1611.60] You may go, I'll do it myself.
[1618.41] -Oh, Mama, this is so beautiful.
-I got it made for your wedding.
[1623.38] But I didn't know that you'll
get married in such a hurry.
[1627.07] -Mama?
-Yeah, so? See how you are getting married.
[1631.71] Mama, don't question the ways
Nosheen chose, just look at the results.
[1637.17] Stop this drama.
[1638.84] Hurry up, they have brought a cleric to
solemnize the marriage from somewhere,
[1642.47]  or he might run away too.
[1644.16] Oh, God, mama what are
you saying?
[1646.37] I got successful in my planning
after going through so much trouble.
[1649.82] Really? Had I not helped her
[1653.66] then instead of your marriage
procession going out from here
[1655.33] you would have left this house
with your funeral procession.
[1657.30] Mama, you're so sweet.
[1659.79] Oh, just stop it.
[1663.03] Nosheen, tell me were you
actually going to kill yourself?
[1668.56] Mama, may my enemies die.
[1671.31] Oh, Nosheen, you are such a drama queen.
[1673.95] That I am.
[1675.60] Now, hurry up before your
daddy changes his mind.
[1678.77] Okay, just wait a minute, let me adjust it.
[1681.88] Come on, let's go.
[1687.19] Mom, please have a little juice.
[1691.11] You have just had your
breakfast since morning.
[1695.13] Please, just have a little.
[1698.91] Mom, why are you doing this?
[1707.53] What's going to happen
by you being like that?
[1709.53] Why are you getting so disturbed?
[1713.04] You should thank God that he saved us.
[1719.46] A person who is getting
married to someone else
[1723.59] and has a relationship
with someone else
[1726.26] would he be a good life partner?
[1731.84] Tell me, Mom, am I wrong?
[1736.32] If all this got revealed
to us after marriage
[1739.76] then just imagine, would
I have had any option?
[1745.48] Faiq likes Nosheen and they...
[1753.99] Have they gotten married?
[1759.41] I don't know, Mom.
[1761.33] They got married or not, that
shouldn't make any difference to us.
[1774.52] You marriage got called off?
[1781.45] Your marriage
[1787.49] got called off?
[1791.11] I have accepted this reality.
[1794.43] Please you should do so too.
[1798.50] Get hold of yourself, Mom.
[1801.03] Nothing is going to happen this way.
[1803.81] Who is going to marry you?
[1806.22] Who is going to marry you now?
[1807.73] Tell me, tell me who is
going to marry you now?
[1811.89] Who is going to?
[1813.61] Mom, what will happen by doing this?
[1817.42] Please get hold of yourself.
[1821.64] I am losing courage too.
[1824.70] I am about to break down.
[1827.72] I need you.
[1830.42] We both should support
each other in this difficult time.
[1835.69] Please, Mom, I have
nobody else other than you.
[1845.11] Go.
[1850.58] Go away.
[1853.40] Go away from here.
[1855.70] -Mom!
-I'm going to be fine.
[1859.72] I will be fine.
[1862.45] Leave me alone.
[1866.84] Leave me alone.
[1869.80] Go.
[1872.36] Go.
[1874.35] Go away.
[1878.45] Go away.
[1881.70] Go from here.
[1885.08] Go away.
[1910.98] Aima,
[1913.87] as a father I
[1917.43] want to say to you that
[1919.99] you marry Zaid.
[1922.19] Dad, Zoya isn't home.
She has gone somewhere.
[1925.06] Her phone is switched off as well.
[1926.74] I don't know where she is,
I'm going to look for her.
[1928.47] Zaid, don't worry.
[1930.96] I know that she must
have gotten this shock.
[1935.20] Where is Zaid?
[1936.99] Why aren't you saying something?
What's wrong my child? What?
[1942.09] You have ruined
everything Azmat, everything.
[1945.53] You have destroyed our happiness.
[1948.05] This, what we have done. We have hurt
everyone just for the sake of our happiness.
