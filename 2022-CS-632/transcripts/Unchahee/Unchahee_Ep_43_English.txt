From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you Don't you dare bring my
daughter, Nosheen, between all this. I won't tolerate. You mother and daughter
always bring Nosheen in between. Oh, God! Auntie, please leave
before I lose my temper. Oh, so you are going to
kick me out of my own house? This is my house and you
should keep that in your mind. You are supposed to tie it like that, okay? Nice watch. Come on let's go, hurry up. -Get up.
-Okay. You won't give up like that. I'll just give
your number to cyber crime department. Nosheen! -Who?
-It's me, Faisal. Hello? Who is this? Why don't
you talk if you are calling? You must have a lot
of free time but I don't. If you call again then I am going
to give your number to my husband, he is going to talk to you then. Don't know what kind of a looser does such things. You won't give up like that. I am going to
give your number to cyber crime right now. Nosheen. -Who is this?
-Faisal here. Nosheen, please don't hang up. I haven't seen a bigger honorless
and cheap person in my whole life. And what made you think that I
am going to hang up your call? I am going to send you to jail.
Just wait and watch. I understand, Nosheen, you are absolutely
right. I have done a great sin with you. I did wrong to you, but God
did bad to me many more times. Just shut this nonsense and
return each and every paisa of mine. You don't know me well. I am going to
bring your whole family on the streets. Just shut up because I
am not interested in it at all. Return my money. By the way, Salman, you have done
the best thing to return to Pakistan. Well, wherever one is destined
to earn, one has to go there. So have you looked for a job after
getting back, are you doing anything? Yeah, I ave been working for the past two, three
months. I am heading an advertising agency. -Two, three months?
-Yes. -And when did you return?
-It's been around five to six months. Means you are here for past five, six
months and you are telling it to me now? I had no idea that you have moved here. It was when I took your number
from Abbas that I came to know. Salman, that's really sad. I mean
can anyone tell that we are best friends? Well, that implies on you too.
You didn't stay in contact with me either. Well, that's true. People are so much connected with each other
in this age, and we are so disconnected despite that. Anyway, just forget it, now that
I'm back we'll stay connected. Yes, sure, why not. What else, how is life? Yeah, she is fine, and one
more thing, I have gotten married. Oh, really? And you didn't even bother telling
me such a big news. What is this? No it's not like that. What can I
say? There has been a lot of drama. Drama? Yeah, I will tell you in detail
some day, now that you're here. You remember, Faiq,
while in school and college until you didn't tell me everything
what happened during the day you weren't able to digest your food. Obviously, who would I tell if not
you. You were my crime partner too. Well, I was never like you. But you were an always
an accomplice in whatever I did. That's true. By the way, Salman, it's good that you
are back. I was feeling very lonely here. And I badly needed a friend too. Is everything all right?
You don't seem too happy. No I'm all right.
You tell me how is that... Yes, Dad, that's the reason we
had to postpone our flight for a few days. No problem, dear. It's good
till then you both can enjoy together. Aima, are you happy dear? Yes, a lot. It felt really good by listening to you. May God keep you very happy. I truly wish that for you. Thank you, Dad. Do you want
to talk to Zaid? He is right here. No, I'll talk to him later.
I have to go for a meeting right now. Okay, Dad. Take care. You too, take care
and take care of Zaid too. -Good bye.
-Good bye. Get my car ready, please,
and ask the team to reach the site. -I told him.
-Good. -Did you tell Zoya?
-No. -Why?
-Just like that. She must be waiting for your calls. If she is waiting for it so much,
she can call me herself then. Besides, she hung up on me. You both are so stubborn. What can I say to you both? Don't say anything. For now
just think about these three days, where are we going to go
and what are we going to eat. Aima, what happened? Zaid, please call Zoya. What's wrong with you, Aima? Besides this is my and Zoya's
matter why are you getting in between? I am already in between you two. This is destiny, Aima. This is all God's planning.
Nothing is in my or your hands. Yeah, but I had promised Zoya that she is
never going to have any complains from me. What do you think all
this is because of you? Our meeting getting delayed
or her misbehaving with me, you don't have any fault in that. Yeah, but our stay is extended, so if you stay angry with her, she might think that I might
have to do something with it... Aima, please stop blaming yourself.
Nothing is happening because of you. Oh, God, five missed calls! Don't know what this guy wants.
If Faiq sees this he is going to kill me. Don't you get it? My love, I... Shut up, Faisal. I have told you
that I am married now. I know, Nosheen.
But honestly I miss you so much. I have to meet you just once, just once. -Shut your nonsense.
-This is not nonsense, Nosheen. Please meet me just once.
Please, just once. Even I have to meet
you. What do you think? Am I going to let go
off my money so easily? No. You have deceived me, and you
think I am going to spare you for that? I didn't deceive you, Nosheen. Faisal, just hang up now. I honestly have to tell you
about something very important. Listen, nothing you say
is important to me anymore. Just hang up now or else
my mother in law will come. Look, until you agree to meet me
I am not going to hang up. Go to hell. Nosheen, hello? Hello? Oh, God, what should I do?
He has become a curse for me. Zoya, Zaid's flight must have landed. What time was his flight? It must have landed at 7 o'clock. But it's 10:30 now. He should have come by now to pick you up. I am so angry at that boy.
He didn't even call you. I'm asking you something. I didn't get any calls or message from him! And why are you getting on my nerves by asking
me the same question over and over again? He doesn't love me! All that was just a drama. It's nothing like that. Zoya, Zoya, my child. Relax, dear. Everything
is going to be all right. -Everything is going to be fine.
-He doesn't love me. Since you have come to this house,
you have destroyed the peace here. Wow, now you are going to
accuse me when it's all your fault? What does that mean? What is it that we have done to you? That's the thing. Since I have
come here, neither you guys have nor you have made me feel
like I am a new bride. -Where is Nosheen?
-I don't know. What is the problem with you both? You both were fighting last night
so much too, there was so much noise. Hello, Zaid, I was calling you,
why weren't you answering my call? -Greetings, Auntie.
-Greetings. I have asked you something.
Why weren't you receiving my call? I was busy and couldn't attend your call. What was so important
that is more than Zoya's happiness? Did you want something from me? Yeah, I have to talk to you,
come over to my place right now. -I can't come right now, auntie.
-What do you mean by that? Do you think I have no worth at all? Auntie, you can talk to me politely too. Zaid, don't try to teach me manners. I have to talk to you something
important about my daughter. Come to my place right this moment. -Auntie, I told you, I can't come.
-Can't come? Why? Why can't you come? Auntie, try to understand. I can't
come because I am in Islamabad. What? Islamabad? But weren't
you supposed to be back today? Yes, but our meeting has been
postponed, and I am getting back on Monday. -Monday?
-Yes. But you know that you
and Zoya have a flight on Monday. I know, I know. I will reach by 8:00-9:00. Look, Zaid. Keep your word. You must land in Karachi
by 9 'O clock. Understood? Yes. -Greetings, Mom.
-Greetings. You here at this time? Yeah I felt like having lunch
with you guys, so I came. That's really nice, dear. What have you made for lunch? -You know I make only vegetable for me.
-Okay, and what did Nosheen make? Nosheen, isn't home. What do you mean? Has she gone
 somewhere today as well? She goes away almost everyday. Did she say something before leaving? No, I was in the washroom, when
I came out she had already left. Where are you? Why do you go to your
mother's home everyday? When will you be back? Just shut this nonsense and
return each and every paisa of mine. You don't know me well. I am going to
bring your whole family on the streets. Just shut up because I
am not interested in it at all. Return my money. Mom, I'll freshen up then we
will have lunch together, okay? Okay, son. To tell you the truth, Nosheen,
I am missing you so much. Aren't you ashamed even a little? Even after what you have done to me, you
are saying all this nonsense? That is the truth.
If I hadn't had this problem I would have never deceived you. Nosheen, I love you so much. Shut up, don't say all this nonsense to me. And try to trap those with these stupid
love promises who may believe you. I have only come to meet you
so that you return my money. I will return it, Nosheen. I promise I am
going to return each and every penny of yours. But please pray for me. I am
honestly stuck very badly right now. I don't care if you get stuck or die. I have got nothing to do with you. And I wish that your family has
to pay for what you have done too. It's already done.
We have been through very bad times. You will be surprised when you will hear it. -Because I know that we both love each...
-Enough, just shut up! I love my husband only. And you know what? I am not even
interested in your useless stories. But, Nosheen, I can't
love anyone else than you. Go to hell. I don't care. And just don't take me wrong
that I have come here for any other reason. I have only come here so that
you return my money within a week. -And if you don't do it then...
-I will do it, I promise I will, but... Not a month, at least
give me time for a month. I will return all your money. Okay, fine. Arrange my money
within a month and return it to me. -Listen, Nosheen.
-What now? Actually, can you lend me some money? What? Have you lost your mind? Nosheen's mother is here. Okay. Here, have some tea. -What are you doing?
-I'm tracing her location. What's the use of all this?
You are getting hyper for no reason. You think I am getting hyper for no reason? I didn’t mean to say that.
All I meant is that I can understand that you are frustrated. -But she is your wife.
-Exactly, she is my wife. And I have to find out. Don't know what this girl is involved into. You are over-thinking. Why shouldn't I over-think?
Haven't you seen what she is doing? She might have gone to some friend. Look, Salman, if she had gone to
her friend, she didn't need to lie to me. -I don't know. She might have some reason.
-To lie? She might be afraid that you are going
to scold her, that's why she lied to you. Come on man, it's not like I
am a cruel person and hit her that she is going to hide things from me. Anyway, forget it. Have your tea.
It's getting cold. -My blood is boiling over that girl.
-What did her mother say? All sorts of useless things,
which don't make any sense. Right. I was furious, but I just
controlled myself in front of her. That was right of you. She must have had no idea either
that's why she came to your place. -She must have felt so awkward.
-I don't know, all this is her upbringing only. And you know what, I don't like Nosheen's
mother that much in her family either. Look, Faiq, I'd say
you shouldn't give such harsh reaction. You mean you want me to ask Nosheen
that Nosheen, where have you been? I was getting so worried about you.
Yeah, do you want that? I don't want that at all. I'm just
saying that stay calm right now. It is possible that she might
have a genuine reason. For now, just have your tea and go home. Auntie must be getting worried about you. No, I won't go home right now. If I go now
then honestly I am going to end everything. Man! Okay, just drink your tea,
it's getting cold. Drink it, man. -Zaid, you scared that manager.
-Wasn't it so much fun? He was actually, shivering. When he said that there is no mattress
available I thought of doing a little mischief. You're so mean. By the way, just call him
and tell him not to get the mattress  or else he might buy
it and send it over to the room. Okay. Aima! What happened? -Show me.
-Zaid, something has pricked me here. -Wait, wait a second. Hey Wait, please.
-No, please! I see it, it's a little... It was this. -Is it better now?
-Yeah. Please. Put your foot down. I'm going to call them and complain,
they haven't cleaned it here properly. No, please, leave it. Why are you crying? I just took
out the glass. Does it still hurt? No. -Then why are you crying?
-Zaid, -Can I ask something from you?
-Yeah, sure tell me. Your ignorance hurts me a lot. Can't you stay with me like this? I don't want anything else. From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned to chirp from you When life starts to test you -Faiq, auntie is calling.
-I don't want to talk to anyone. What is this childish behavior? I said I don't want to talk to anyone. Why are you punishing
auntie because of her. Look, Salman, mom knows very well that
when I'm angry I react in the same way. She knows it, but right
now she is getting worried. I will leave in a while. Right now I
don't feel like looking at Nosheen. What is this childish behavior? What do you want? If you want
me to leave from here I will leave. I didn't mean that at all. You are taking out
someone else's frustration on someone else. I'm just trying to explain you and
in return you are fighting with me,  what's wrong with you? I have gone mad. Since the day this
girl has entered my life I have gone mad. You can't punish everyone
because of a single person. Faiq, what's wrong? What can one say. He is hopeless. Hello, Mira. Listen if my husband calls 
or I call you then please say that I was with you today. Please, can you preach me
later on, just do as I say right now. Okay, listen, I'm hanging up.
Just don't mess up, okay bye. It's 10 'O clock, don't know where
this guy is. I am really worried. Faiq, I have been calling you
for so long, where have you been? I went for some work, Mom. Just listen to me. Mom, please, don't ask me to be patient. I am going to make a final
decision about this girl today. Don't get so emotional. Mom, what are you trying to say? She is cheating on me and I
should be gentle with with her? I'm just saying that at least
listen to her patiently first... Please, Mom, I can't
be polite to her anymore. -But still...
-What's wrong? What are you guys arguing about? -Should I tell you? Should I tell you what...
-No! Faiq, is this the way to talk? You don't see her rather stopping me, who has
done wrong and still doesn't accepting it. -What have I done?
-What have you done? Where do you go by telling us that
you are going to your mother's place? I went to meet my friend. And who will tell us that you are telling
the truth? Because I don't trust you at all. Here, I have her umber in my phone. Just dial
it and ask her whom I was with today. Dial it. Take it away, I don't
want to talk to anyone. Okay, fine, then don't.
Mom, please tell him. Faiq, whenever a person talks
in anger, he says wrong things. We will sit calmly and talk in detail. Besides, this is just the first time. Not the first time, 
but it has happened the last time. And if I see it happening again then just pack
your bags and go to your mom's, understood? Who is calling you this late? Faiq, it's mama. Is this the time to call? Faiq, she is my mama. She worries
about me that's why she is calling. Nosheen I know what you are going through. Really? You must be really happy then. Why do you always think
that I'm your enemy? Because I know very well 
whatever you are doing with me. I am not stupid. We have the contract ready with us. We'll
just have to print your name on it. What else. Sure just get the contract, I will sign it.
