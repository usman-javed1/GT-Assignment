From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned to chirp from you If you have got the news
then it must be good. No, but I want to here it from you. Yes Zaid, I'm, I'm expecting. Really? Thank you so much! Faiq has told me a lot about you too. Really? Like what? Like about your marriage and the toxic relationship
between you and your husband. I felt really bad about knowing it. Well, it's good now, because
you have another option now. You can trap anyone you like. Faiq, pick up your phone! What does the report say? Oh! Nosheen, your report is here.
You are expecting. Auntie, I just can't believe it. Yes, dear, the feeling of
becoming a mother is totally unique. It is such a huge honor. Now you'll see, gradually you are going
to get a sense of responsibility yourself. What do you mean? Do you mean
that I am irresponsible right now? Oh, no, you are my wise and nice daughter. It's just that you are so young
that's why you make mistakes. But I'm sure, Nosheen, you are going to prove yourself to be
the best mother and a wonderful wife. Okay, now get ready, quickly. We have to
tell this news to your mother's place too. But I have already called
her and told about it. Oh, you are not supposed to tell
such things just over the phone. WE would have got sweet
and then went to their place. Doesn't matter, we'll still go there. You go get ready and I'll get ready too. -Okay then, I'll tell mama.
-Fine. What are you thinking now? Well, auntie, I thought after
listening to such a great news Faiq is going to come
to me and talk to me. But I don't know where he has gone. That's why I left you two alone, so that you both can end the
complains you have with each other and be okay with each other. Nothing of this sort happened. I'm telling
you auntie, Faiq doesn't love me anymore. Whatever happens after
10-20 years of marriage, our marriage has become like that. And if not anything else, he definitely has something
going on with Sania. Okay, just listen to me, firstly
there must be nothing as such, I'm sure. But even if there is anything like that then I'm always going to support you. And if Faiq even thinks
of something like that, I am never going to
talk to him then, okay? Auntie, are you sure you
are going to support me? Of course. What is all the stuff
you have got, Almas? I just couldn't wait. I have started it from now. Whatever I may
find and I like it, I'm going to buy it. -But, mom, isn't this a bit too much?
-Not at all. No, we didn't even know
yet if it's a boy or a girl. All kids are equal, and besides
you mother is very clever, I have brought such
things which both may use. Check out her excitement, and
she has done all her planning. Well, why don't you tell him,
you have made a lot of plans yourself. Tell him what you were telling me earlier. I was just saying that we should make
a separate room for the baby in this house. Dad, I think it's too early. Yeah I know, but you have no
idea how happy we are, Zaid. I know that becoming
a father is something great but the children of your children
they give you so much pleasure. Yes, I can see that. Believe me, I have forgotten all my worries
and sorrows just by getting this news. Oh, finally happiness has
seen the way to our home. Zaid, where's Zoya? Actually, Zoya went to the hospital,
she had an appointment with the doctor. Why didn't you go with her then? Auntie took her. No, but you should take care
of her, next time you should go. I said that I'll take her but actually
auntie knew the doctor personally so she said I'll take her. Yeah, okay, but you
should go with her next time. Okay. -I think they are...
-Looks like Zoya is back. I think it must be her, they
have been gone for long. -Oh, greetings.
-Greetings, Amber. -Come sit.
-Sure, brother Azmat. -Zoya, how was the doctor's visit?
-It was all right. The doctor has said that by
grace of God, everything is perfect. You both came at such a good time. Just see what your sister has
got for the baby from the market. Oh, great! Well, my daughter has
give such a big news to you. So we shall celebrate as much as we can. Yes, we'll have liveliness
in our house too now. It's good that I have found
all three of you together. I wanted to talk about
something important. Oh forget that, than God you guys are
here, let's take a look at the stuff I got. Sister, please, what I am about to
say is more important than this stuff. So, kindly listen to me. Wait a second, Almas. Go ahead, Amber, what is it? Brother Azmat, I am not going to
waste time in beating about the bush. And neither do I want
to repeat old things. I just wanted to say that I want to
see my daughter happy in this condition. Not tensed. What is it, will you say it now? Zoya isn't happy here. After he has remarried. Auntie, but I have already
talked to Zoya about it. I'm not finished yet, Zaid. I am going to say something very simple. If you all want that Zoya's child is born, then Zaid must leave Aima. What? Faiq, what are you doing here? Nothing, Mom, just sitting here. Did you meet Nosheen? Yeah, I went to the room
but I think she is asleep. Then you should have waken her up,
she has been waiting for you for so long. Wait, let me wake her up. No, Mom, let her sleep. What is it Faiq? I've told you such a
big news but you don't seem happy. No, Mom, it's nothing
like that. I'm happy. Yeah, right, is this how one gets happy? Go look at you face in the mirror. Seems as if you have heard a bad news. Mom, I'm a human too. My feelings, my emotions, don't
they mean anything to you guys? Of course they do. What are you saying? Then the girl with whom I can't
be happy for a single moment, you are asking me to celebrate
with her? How can that be? -I can understand.
-No, you can't. Neither you are getting
it, nor anyone else. Everyone is just celebrating
the entry of a new member, that's it. Did you ever thing about
the kid who is yet to come? He is going to watch his parents
fight everyday. How is he going to feel? Are we going to give him this environment? You are thinking about way ahead. Why shouldn't I think about future. We have to think about it
before bringing him to this world. What kind of environment
can we provide him? He is going to complain to us, and
ask us why we brought him in this world. -The what?
-But all this can change too. How? You will change it, Faiq, you. -Because you are the father.
-And what about the mother? Doesn't the mother has any responsibility? Yes, she is responsible too. -Just give her some time, she'll get better.
-Do you have any surety, Mom? -No, I don't have any surety, but...
-No ifs and buts. She can never get better. You don't have any surety for this even. Mom, can't you see what she is doing? I do, I see everything. That's the reason why I
was against this decision, but you didn't listen to me then. And now I am taking care of your decision. And I want that you don't run
away from you responsibilities, rather fulfill them. Didn't you see what she did
to my friend the other day? -Faiq, just forget that.
-How can I? Mom, she is my friend. She is your friend and this is your wife. Don't forget that. A wife has more rights. Does this mean that she can
misbehave with all my friends like this? Faiq, she wasn't
insulting all your friends. Oh, this means that she can
misbehave with Sania only? If She doesn't like your
and Sania's friendship then let go of your friendship with her. Why? Why should I let go
of this friendship? She is my friend. Enough, Faiq. You have said
a lot and I have heard a lot. Now listen to what I am saying. Do one thing, put yourself in her place. If Nosheen had such a friend,
would you have tolerated it? I know that you couldn't.
And nobody can even. Now listen to what I am
saying and do it as I say. Get up from here, go talk to
Nosheen and end all this dispute. Please, Mom, I don't
feel like talking to her. Faiq, the dispute between
husband and wife aren't long lasting. It's just temporary anger
which fades out in a little while. But remember one thing, only
when someone wants it to fade out. Do you get what I am saying? Give me sometime, I'll be normal again. What did Amber say?
We haven't even celebrated properly yet. Was this the time to
say something like that? I can understand, obviously Amber is
Zoya's mother, she is worried about her. But is this the way? And there are no two opinions about it that no mother wants her daughter being imposed by her husband's
second wife all the time, but still... The ifs and buts you are saying,
I know very well what they mean. But understand one thing
clearly and memorize it too, The evil demands
that Amber has brought forward, they can't be fulfilled until I'm alive. Rest is up to God. So to save Aima's marriage
shall we let go of our son? Shall we forget like
nothing had ever happened? We are not going to
compromise over anything. And your sister should have thought a
thousand times before saying this thing, the cheap and unethical
thing that she has said. These are relationships, not a deal. That when the contract ends
she puts a condition to renew it otherwise they will end. Both those mother and daughter
shall realize that a child is God's gift, which they are using
as a tool to blackmail us. And as far as the baby is concerned then Zaid has as much
right on him as Zoya has. So she can't do it
without Zaid's permission, tell that clearly to your sister too. If she listened to me she wouldn't have said all these
things in front of everyone, Azmat. So you mean to say that you
can't do anything in this regard? Azmat, I'll talk to her for
sure but you should also... I am not interested in
hearing what she has to say. Zaid will not leave Aima,
that's my final decision. But, Mr. Azmat, why don't you
ask Zaid once what he wants? You and your sister shall remember
one thing, you shall tell her that too, that as soon as you both understand
it, it is as better for you both. Go now, I need to rest. Conditions. A new story everyday. There must be a chaos
at Azmat Hussain's house. Everyone must be burning with rage. Mom, we have given them a huge shock. What if something wrong happens? What do you mean? What can go wrong? I mean, uncle is a heart patient. What if anything happens to
him because of tension? Nothing is going to happen to him.
Azmat Hussain is one tough nut. He may give a heart attack to
others but nothing will happen to him. And don't you worry at all. Because Zaid is going
to leave Aima for sure. He has got no other option. We should be the one getting worried,
because we have lied. And besides, if Zaid gets
to know about the reality, what do you think, Mama?
What is he going to do? Will he ever going to look at me again? Who is telling him? He will only
know what you are going to tell him. And when are we going to tell
him about it, I have decided that. Just make up your mind. Either do as I say or else you
will have to live your life like this. Mom, even if nobody tells
him, what if he finds out himself? What if he takes me to the doctor? Or if he asks for my reports? Well, who knows you might
actually get pregnant by then. Seriously, and this problem gets resolved. Still, Mom, won't he
keep a count of months? He is an educated, wise boy. Oh, what have
I got myself into? Please, Zoya, don't
think about so far ahead. Just think about how to
move out from that house. I know what you are planning. You will tell me to tell Zaid
that I have had a miscarriage. Besides, Mom, one has to tell
a hundred lies to cover a single lie. Zoya, relax, you are overthinking. -Tell me, did you think of that?
-Yeah. We will have to do like that,
and there's nothing wrong with it. And why are you feeling so guilty? Actually Zaid has deceived you, and
your deception is nothing compared to his. Tell me, did Zaid call you? No, he must be angry with me on this. He will call. He must be busy. A child is such a thing that
most of the people get corrected. And look at this rocking
chair. Isn't it nice? After dad gets better,
then after a week we’ll... Zoya! I can't shift right now. I'm not asking you to shift right
now, we'll shift when dad gets better. You didn't get me. What I am trying to say is
that for now I can not shift . What do you mean for now? Dad is not well at all and
I can't leave him like that. Zaid, you aren't ready yet?
We had to go for a meeting. Quickly, get ready, we're getting late. If you don't mind, can you
attend the meeting in my place? Okay, I'll go then. Listen, don't go alone. Go
with the driver, the car is outside. Is everything all right, Zaid? Yes, actually there was another important
thing so I thought of doing that. You can take car of the meeting. All right. Shall I get some tea made for you? Sorry, did you ask me anything? I was asking if you
wanted to have some tea. No, it's okay. You can have some. Okay, I'll get going then. Faiq, aren't you even a little happy
after knowing about my pregnancy? How do you think such things, Nosheen? Obviously, what else can I think? Neither you have said anything,
in fact you went away. Look, Nosheen, I want
things to get better between us. We shall stay happy so that the
environment in the house improves. But you don't let that happen. You keep complaining all the time. How am I feeling right now,
I can't tell you how happy I am. Then express it. Until you
tell me how am I going to know? You aren't saying anything. Look, I don't like you
taunting me on everything. If you want to know how I feel
you can ask them politely too. There you go, your lecture has started. I'm not lecturing you,
just telling you something very basic. Every good wife shall have an idea
what her husband likes or dislikes. This way the environment
of the house remains good. Now tell me, do I had to get such a good
news this way? While fighting with you? Tell me? Anyway, what's done is done. Nosheen, I want things
to get better between us. We shouldn't be fighting
all the time be it any issue. And you should work with me for it. I should try only, you won't? I will. Tell me, what do you want?
What can I do for you? What do you think, I don't notice
that you ignore me or don't talk to me? You think it's easy? It hurts me a lot. But what difference does it make to you? You know what I feel, Faiq?
That you are just fed up of me. Okay, sorry, I apologize. From now on I won't do
anything which may hurt you. -But you should promise me too.
-Okay. Nosheen, I want to clear one more thing. Neither I love Sania,
nor I have an affair with her. She is just my friend, that's it. Are you telling the truth? -I swear upon you.
-No, I don't believe on you swearing over me. You don't even love me.
You are swearing falsely. Swear upon you unborn
child that you don't love Sania. Okay fine, if you may get
satisfied this way, then I swear upon our unborn
child, I'm telling the truth. Did you see what your son has done, he didn't talk to me even
after such a good news. And don't know where he has gone now. That's why I left you both
alone and came to my room that you both may cheer
up and end your dispute. Nothing of this sort happened.
I went to my room  and thought Faiq would come after
me talk to me and apologize. But he didn't talk to me at all. Congratulations to you too. May
God give good fate to our kids. Please carry on, I'll be right back. People have such dads who
forgive their children's mistakes. And here my dad, he isn't even
happy for me on such a big news. He will only be happy when I'll die. Were you doing anything important? No. I hope I didn't disturb you. Now what does that mean?
