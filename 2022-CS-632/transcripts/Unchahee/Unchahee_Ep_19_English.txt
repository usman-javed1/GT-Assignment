From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you Call Faisal right away,
or let me talk to him on the phone. What did I tell you? Lower your voice.
Don't you understand? I won't, what are you going to do? To hell with you both,
do you think I'm mad? Listen, girl, if you misbehave even once then you will be responsible
for the consequences. You should be thankful that even after this
behaviour your dignity is still intact. Brother, just tell me
what should I say to her now? Tell her anything.
Tell her I have left for Dubai. Excellent, you have thought
of such an international excuse. Yes, she will be at ease
after knowing about Dubai. Or else if she gets to know that I am here then she will find me and won't
give up until I marry her. What happened then? Where did that guy go? And why was Nosheen leaving from there? I don't know. If Nosheen got happy after seeing you it means that that guy has defrauded her. Might be. Did you talk to Nosheen? I just did what my duty was. Other than that, honestly I
don't want to know anything  and I don't know anything either. It's between Mama and Nosheen now. Mama. Don’t call me your mama. Aren't you ashamed to embarrass
your mother in front of the whole world? Mama, I'm sorry. Don't say sorry. It's not
like you've broken a piece of crockery  that you apologize
for it and we will get a new one. Nosheen nothing can be brought back now. Why did you even come back? Why didn’t you die there? -Mama, at least don't scold me.
-Why not? If I could, I would kill you, Nosheen. I always used to tell you that
that guy is not right. But all you could think about was love. Mama, had I known that he is
such a big fraud then I wouldn't have ever done it. You just needed a chance
to do something stupid. Nosheen, since the day you have
been born my life has been in a turmoil. Why are you crying now? Have you compromised you chastity? No it's nothing like that. That scoundrel was only
interested in my money. Tell me where are those jewelry sets? Tell me. Just say something,
where are those diamond sets? I don't have them, Mama. Nosheen, don't tell me
that he has run away with them. Such a huge loss. Our honor and money, both have been robbed. You scumbag. Don't say that, Mama. I'm
accepting that I committed a mistake. Your dad is going to suck my blood. I've got such a bad fate. Mama, don't worry, I won't spare him. Just see what I'm going to do with him. Just shut up, Nosheen. Aren't you done humiliating us? Mama, I know that I've ruined
everything, just give me a chance. No more chances for you. You thought of yourself as something,
you have disgraced yourself, Nosheen. After what you have done,
people would despise you. Now stay here, until your
father feels pity for you. I think, I should talk to sister. It's a difficult time for her. I should encourage her. Poor sister is alone in such a time. And in such times, one needs
someone to encourage them. Mother, I'd suggest you not to do it. What do you mean? There has been such a huge incident. Her daughter's wedding has been called off. And everyone in the family now knows
that Nosheen had run away from home. Even the neighbours are
saying all sorts of things. What would be a mother
going through in such a time. Mother, there are many others
with whom she can share her pain. What are you talking about, Aima? It's our duty to be compassionate
towards her. But Mother, you shouldn't forget that whenever you try
to be a part of their matters then you become
the bad one eventually. Look, I'm not going to give her any advice. I'm just going to console her. If you actually want to console,
then do it for Dad. He is more hurt than auntie, and alone too. That is understood. He is my brother. It's necessary for me to support him. Besides, he just goes quiet
when he suffers form such a sorrow. You are right, Mother. The bigger
the sorrow is, the quieter he gets. A father's and brother's honor
are the girls of the house. And when girls ruin this honor then men break from inside. Yes, Mother, you are absolutely right. Zaid, is also very disturbed
because of Nosheen. Yes, dear. Take care of him. One really needs a friend in such times. Look, he has never left you alone
in your difficult times. He has always been by your side
in every tough situation. Yes, Zaid has done a lot of favors to me. Yes, dear, it's your turn now
to return all those favors. Yes, mother. I'm not going to spare that Faisal.
What does he think of himself? Just watch, what I'm going to do to him. I'm going to file a report against him. I am going to find him, no
matter where he is hiding. He will be accountable of each and
every penny of mine that he has embezzled. Mom, what's with her?
When is this madam going away? Don't say like that. She'll leave in a  few days. It's
just been a day since she is here. Mom, you know well that I
don't mind anybody's presence. But I can't stand that girl. I know, but what can I do I'm also just
doing it because of my relation with her. Zaid called me and asked for a favor. Yes, it's nice that you
are giving him a favor, but... you don't know
how problematic this girl is. When I was coming down,
I heard her talking loudly to someone. She is so weird. What can I do? I was thinking myself that while giving this favor what
if I might get in some trouble myself. By the way, are you going somewhere? I was going to meet Zaid. Aima called. She said
that Zaid is really worried. -So I was just going to cheer him up.
-Okay. Come sit. No I won't sit. I just wanted
to ask you something. Yes, sure, what is it? Auntie, I wanted to go somewhere
for some work, so I need you car. Can you please ask the driver? It isn't possible
because I am going with the driver. And mama is going to office in her car. Then why don't you drop me, auntie? I have no issues in dropping you, but it would be better if you call
sister and ask for her permission. Yes, it's better that you ask
for auntie's permission, first. So am I going to stay like
a prisoner in this house too? No, no. I didn't mean that at all. I can't do anything. Sister has strictly
told me not to send you anywhere. That is why I was saying it. You can't believe, Shabana, without Nosheen, all this,
the house seems so empty. I haven't slept for so many days. Yes, sister, daughter's have
their own presence in the house. I can understand your condition. Shabana, I can't look at her empty room. I haven't gone in their since then. It's just a test by God. God will ease every
difficulty with his will. I feel relieved after you have come. What are you talking about, sister. Those who stay under one roof
share their sorrows and happiness. Really? Do you mean it? I thought, why would you care about us? Your daughter
is flourishing in front of you. No, sister, Nosheen is my own child. Do you mean it? Or is this just hypocrisy? And in reality you are happy within
that my daughter has left this home. No, it's not like that, sister. I want to see her back in
this home as soon as possible. Really? Yes, sister. I don't know
how to prove it to you. Shabana, do you actually want
to do something good for me? Yes, sister. obviously. But why are you asking this question? Not questioning, I'm begging you. please try to talk to Azmat. About what? That he takes Nosheen back in. He never refuses what you and Aima ask him. Yes, sister. Actually, Please don't say no.
For your daughter's sake. Look how much we have done for you. How many favor have we done to you. And this is the time that you
shall return those favors, and help us. Yes, sister,
I'll definitely talk to brother. But I can't say if he
would listen to me or not. You know very well
how angry he is right now. Oh, yes. Now you'll make excuses
because I has asked you for a favor. You want me to beg in front of you
and cry for help? No, no. I didn't mean that. I will try my best to convince brother. I myself want to see Nosheen
back in this home. Shabana, do whatever you can. Please, convince Azmat that
he bring Nosheen back home. -Just do anything.
-Sister, please don't embarrass me, I understand. I will try my best. Sister, it's difficult for me
to take Nosheen's responsibility. She is really ill-mannered.
She doesn't listen to me. How strict can I be with her. Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that Zaid , till when this drama
of yours is going to last? Drama? Had this happened
to you, I would have asked you if it's a
drama or something else. I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. See, Nosheen has been found,
why don't you cheer up then? Yes, Zaid, Nosheen is back,
now please cheer up. We both are really worried about you. I'm fine. I just need some time. -No, this can't happen.
-What can't happen? Means we are not going to leave you alone. Zaid, Zoya has come for you
and you are asking her to leave? How wrong. I know you're worried for Nosheen. I am not worried for Nosheen,
I'm worried because of Nosheen. -Say something at least.
-I've got a headache. -Let me get a pain killer for you.
-No need for that. I know how to get rid of his headache. Really how? Tell me, how is Kinza doing? Please, now don't take her name. Why? What has happened that you
don't even like us to take her name? She is a girl of bad character. What do you mean? I was thinking my self since
a few days to break up with her, but then she gave me
a very solid reason to do that. What reason? Tell us too. She was dating three people at a time. Faraz told me... Wow, great, I thought you guys
came to cheer me up. Great, just great. Please, leave. -Yes, that's all right.
-Yes we came to cheer you up, but after giving this news
you have cheered us up. Sorry. -I'm going from here.
-Zaid. -How are you Shabana?
-I'm fine, brother. Are you taking your medicines timely? You have your appointment
with the doctor tomorrow. I am not sure about the appointment
but I'm taking my medicines on time. It's possible that they
change your medicine. Okay, brother. Okay, I'm going to rest now.
Got really tired today. Brother, can you please stay with me for a while. What is it brother,
you don't seem all right. You seem a little burdened. -I'm fine.
-Still, if there is anything let me know. One feels relieved after sharing. Shabana, when a person's children put his honor at stake, then no matter how confident he is, how broad his shoulders are, they bend. What my daughter has done to me, I don't think I will ever be able
to look anyone in the eye after that. She has humiliated me in
front of the world in such a way that I have lost all my pride. Brother, the only One who can give us
respect or humiliate us is the God. But the human has some
responsibilities too, Shabana. Wasn't it my daughter's
responsibility to keep my dignity intact. Yes, of course. But when a person
can't fulfill his responsibility, then God doesn't stop
being merciful to him. In fact He gives him chances
over and over again to forgive him. Brother, you should forgive too. Whom should I? Whom should I forgive? And whose mistakes should I let go? And I may forgive by suppressing my anger, but at least someone should ask
for forgiveness from me sincerely. If a person repents sincerely
then even God forgives him. You're right. Almas often asks me to forgive
Hammad, but how can I forgive him? When he hasn't even come
to asks for forgiveness. He should at least ask me,
at least be ashamed of his deeds. Don't know how long it has been,
he hasn't come to say sorry even once. If he can't face me
he could at least call me. Brother, please don't lose hope. You'll see, he will definitely ask
for your forgiveness. How can he stay happy
without his parents and siblings. If not today, he will admit
his mistakes tomorrow. No, no, no Shabana. They both are a rebellion from inside. They will always keep blaming
me for their mistakes, but I... I have steeled myself now. I have accepted
that my own people are at fault. I will have to live with this truth. Brother, if Nosheen asks for forgiveness... Don't you even take her name
in front of me. This isn't going to happen. You take rest. Sister, it's getting really difficult
for me to take responsibility for Nosheen. She is very ill-mannered. She doesn't listen to me. After all how strict can I be with her. Even today she was insisting to go out. How can I let her go outside? When I told her that she can't then she stamped her feet in
anger and went upstairs. No you did very right, Amber. This girl can't be trusted anymore. After all you have
given me her responsibility. I can't guard her all the time
leaving everything. I didn't go to work even today
because of her. No, Amber, I'm going
to tell her myself. Where is she? -She went upstairs to the room.
-Nosheen! Nosheen. Sister, maybe the door is closed,
that's why she can't hear you. -Let me check.
-Yes, but let me come along too. Just tell her in front of me that
you haven't allowed her to go out. Nosheen, Nosheen? Amber, this girl has cheated us again. No, sister, relax, don't worry.
She might be somewhere in the house. Dad, may I come in? Oh, Zaid, come. What brings you here? It's my dad's office.
Do I need a reason to be here? Can't I come here just like that? Yes of course you can, but I wasn't
expecting you here like this. You should expect, Dad. You always wanted me to take
care of your business when I grow up. I have stop expecting anything
from my children. And expecting anything good
is out of question. Dad, even fro me? What did I get having
expectations from the other two that I'd get anything from you? But I'm not like them, Dad.
And you know it. I can understand your
tension and your sorrow, but I will try my best that me
or my decisions never hurt you. Anyways, it's good that you are here.
I'll let you meet the research team. We are discussing some new ideas. You can give your opinion as well. I would love to. But right now, I came to talk
to you about something else. You can talk to me about anyone
except for Nosheen. Dad a problem doesn't get solved
if we stop talking about it. Till when are you going to avoid it? Her living at auntie's like this
isn't appropriate at all. Zaid, I have much more
experience than you do. I know very well what is good
for whom and what not. Whatever is happening to her is very less,
she deserves a lot more than that. -Dad...
-Excuse me. Yes, Mr. Ikram. Send research analyst,
Yousuf and his team members to my room. Coffee? Sure. Send two coffees. please. Thank you. If she doesn't come home by herself this
time, then we won't go to look for her too. To hell with her! Don't say like that, sister. Just pray
that she returns the same way she left. If she won't return
then we'll be worried again that... Where were you? Do you have any idea how worried I was? Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that What? Zaid and office? What are you talking about? You have heard it right. But long drives, outings, 
all these things suit Zaid. Why had he gone to office? Actually, I’m the one 
who sent him to dad''s office. But why? I’ve sent Zaid to talk 
to him about Nosheen. Auntie is too worried 
and I really can't see her like that. Oh, come on, Aima. Had auntie been
worried, all this wouldn't have happened. Whatever it is, Zoya, Auntie requested me
that me and mother should request dad 
to let Nosheen come back. So, did she talk about it? No, this time dad isn't ready 
to even listen to mother. Nosheen has done such a thing that I can't even find 
the courage to talk to dad. That's why I asked Zaid to go to office. Maybe dad gets happy by him
going there and agree to his request. Oh, I see. Aima, do anything 
but take that girl from our home. I mean, she is on my nerves. She's so irritating. Please, Aima, it's a request. Zoya, we're trying that dad agrees. Let's see when he does. Aima, I am bugging you 
for so long sitting here because I want to stay away 
from that problematic girl. I know, she is a bit difficult. Anyway, let's talk about something else. Okay, fine. So what 
do you want to talk about? Let's talk about marriage. By the way, have you ever thought about it? Zoya, why did you think 
of asking such a question suddenly? We can't deny that 
it's our age to get married. I mean everybody thinks 
about it in this age. Like how is her husband going to be, 
how will her in-laws be like? Don't tell me 
that you haven't thought about it. Seriously, I haven't thought about it ever. Exactly. Someone you doesn't even exist
in your life, how can you imagine him? But I don't know, I don't like anyone. I have met 4 people for it, 
and rejected a 400. I can understand. You're too choosy. If you don't choose 
your friends that easily, then this is a matter of choosing
your life partner, you'll take your time. Exactly, I can't accept 
someone that easily. I've got a small circle 
and I'm happy with that. And to tell you the truth,
I don't feel the need of anyone else. But I will have to get
married soon, because it's my mom's wish 
and I can't help it. Zoya she must be worried about you. After all you are her responsibility. Like the way my mother is worried about me. Because they both don't have 
their life partners with them. That's true. That's the reason 
I agreed to what mother said. Had dad been there, 
I wouldn't have listened to her at all. These mothers, I tell you. 
They emotional blackmail you so much. I am thinking these days, 
how my would be husband is going to be? Will I ever be able 
to manage things with him? Will I be able to adjust with his family? Will we be able to cooperate. 
I mean, you get my point? Just relax, Zoya. Everything is going 
to happen with time. You just have to accept your
husband's family sincerely as your own. Oh, come on. You're going 
to be a perfect house-wife. I mean, who is
intelligent, and confident, and who knows how to
make round chapatis too. And you're going to win 
everyone's heart just like that. I have that much confidence on you. By the way, Zoya, if
you're going to get married, what's going to happen
to your modeling passion? What do you mean what's going to happen, I'm going to do it 
whenever I get a chance. And if your husband or your in-laws 
have an objection on it then? So what? It's my life and my decision. Why would I let 
anyone else decide for me? Like every field, 
this field has many issues too. I don't make friends there. I just go there for work and...
I'll keep on trying. God willing, if anyone comes 
he's going to bring his fate with him. This example is used for girls you fool. Yeah, whatever, it's the same thing. When are you going to get wise? When you'll get wise. This girl has ruined my honor. It would have been better 
that I had died before seeing this day. How am I going to tell this 
to Azmat and Zaid? Sister, I thought she would have corrected
herself after facing such a huge fraud. But she has gotten even bolder that before. No, Amber, she hasn't 
become bold but stubborn. Brother Azmat was right 
about getting her married then. At least we wouldn't have to see this day. No, Amber, I have no doubts. 
 She would have run off even after marriage. She is on a mission to humiliate us. What am I going to do, tell me? I think we should wait a little. Just stay composed. Maybe she 
has gone somewhere new for some work. Amber, if she doesn't return this time,
then we won't go looking for her either. To hell with her. Don't say like that. Just pray that the way she left,
she gets back the same may. If she won't come then... Where have you been? Do you have any idea how worried I was? What's wrong, mama, 
why are you getting so hyped up? I went to do something. It's not your dad's or my fault. 
You yourself are responsible for all this. We were so scared because of you. You are creating such a scene 
as if I had run off from home... Of course, running off 
from home is so easy for you. Are you preparing 
to do something more than that? But I won't let you do anything stupid now. Your dad won't do that to you 
what I am going to do with you. Enough, mama. One should learn 
exaggerating things from you. You guys are on my nerves. 
What crime have I committed? Millions of people run off fro their homes. Nosheen. Do you have any idea 
what a huge steep you took? -What have you done, do you...
-No, no, Let her insult me. She is doing it in
front of you today, tomorrow the whole
world is going to watch it. Mama, stop overacting. You really act up a lot in front of auntie. Anyways, tell me when am I going back home? -You aren't going back.
-What do you mean by that? I am going back home with you right now. As soon as you'll enter the house,
your dad is going to break your legs. Then do something, Mama. 
I can't stay here anymore. Why did I get unwanted Nobody knows that Why did I get unwanted Nobody knows that Sister, whatever Nosheen 
has done, it's her mistake. If I am trying to get her
back to this house,  it's because I want the environment
of this house get better. I know everything. There must be some hidden interest
of yours to bring Nosheen back home. You are doing all this 
to look good in front of Azmat. I know everything. I love you, Zoya. I love you too, Zaid. You must be having so much fun by looking at all this situation. You must be enjoying a lot. Go ahead, enjoy. But I'm going to snatch all this happiness 
away from you real soon.
