From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you Nosheen, how am I going to
arrange the rest of the money? It's not my problem. Go work
somewhere or beg on the streets. Okay, half the money is fine. My dear, you are too stupid.
But very useful. Not just a hundred thousand, I will mint
hundreds of thousands of rupees from you. -You and Zoya should move to my house.
-Excuse me? What are you talking about, auntie? You want me to leave my home and stay
at your place like a live in son in law? You might have been his friend in school, but now you are openly
having an affair with him. What are you saying?
Are you in your senses? Don't try to be too
innocent. I know everything. The way you are busy on chat and
call, ignoring me, I understand everything. What? Tell me, who is this girl because
of whom you are ignoring me? What are you doing, Nosheen, leave me. Tell your daughter to
stay in good terms with me. She talks back at me, I'm not just her auntie now, I'm her mother
in law. She should at least regard that. Mom knows everything,
she lives under the same roof. She has an idea about
everything, and still she lectures me. That's a good thing. It is good but I can't say much in
front of her, because this was my wish. Anyway, go home and sort it out now. No, I'm not going home.
I have to go for some work. Are you going to Sania's place? I don't know. Okay, so now I'm trying to
guess what's wrong with you? No, nothing. Really? Then why have you made such a long face? Sania, a person can't have
the same mood all the time. Yeah right. But you always stay so
chilled out, what's wrong today? Did your wife throw you out of the house? -You guessed it right, now.
-Oh, no problem. If she threw you out then go back to her. And as soon as you go home,
hold her feet and ask for forgiveness. Say the dear wife please forgive me, I won't let you complain
ever again. Etc, etc. Thank God, finally, at
least you smiled a little. Okay, now tell me, what has happened?
Why are you sitting with a long face? Nothing, I just had a fight with
Nosheen on a petty issue, nothing else. I understand. I don't know why but I'm
feeling very low right now. It's all right, Faiq. It happens. The relationship
of a husband and wife is as such. When you have a fight, it
feels like everything has ended. But everything gets normal
after a while. Just don't worry. -You are saying it of all the people?
-Why not? -And what about your relation?
-Don't talk about my relation, Faiq. and God forbid that your
marriage ends up like mine. A fight among husband and
wife isn't something surprising. Don't get so disappointed. Go home and sort things out. No, not at all. I don't
want to talk to her at all. It's okay. Then give yourself some time. Everything is going to
be fine with God's will. -Hmm.
-What hmm? Be normal now. People are facing so much
problems in their lives, and here you are sitting with a sad
face after a small fight with your wife. -You're right.
-Good. Okay, now tell me what about the
issues you had at your restaurant? -Yeah, that's settling down gradually.
-Good. -Sania, shall I say something?
-Hmm? -I'm feeling better now.
-Thank God. -Thank you.
-Come one now stop it, no need to be so formal. Okay, let's go to my restaurant,
I have some work there too,  we can have dinner there then. Wow, good idea. I'll just go get ready. How much more ready are you
going to get? You are just fine. Oh you, Faiq. Hello, Salman, I'm coming
to the restaurant, okay? Bye. Come, Sania, hurry up. No, Dad, just leave it. Stop it. Till when are you going to
keep asking him to do things? I don't want the forced love
and forced respect. All of it seems fake. -But I was just...
-I know, Dad, that you love me a lot. That's why you keep
reminding him of my rights. But I want to request something to you, please don't force him to do things. Spend some time with me too, at times. So, tell me, what's new? -Everything is in front of you, Dad.
-Means, a life full of work and engagements? -That's it?
-Yeah, I'm trying to manage. Well, that's nice. Tell me, where did you go after work today? -Actually, auntie called me to meet.
-Everything all right? Yes, everything was fine, she just
wanted some advice for her business. Okay, fine. It's good
that you are helping her. Besides, she doesn't have a son. Dad, I wanted to talk
to you about something. Sure, go ahead. I have to talk to you too. But you go first. I was just thinking Dad that for everyone's benefit, I should take
Zoya and move out from here. Move out? Yes, I mean I want to move
to a separate house with her. Have you already decided, or... No, Dad, it's still under consideration,
I came to take advice from you. So, what do you think what is better? Is this the solution to your problems? Yeah, to me this is a good solution. Besides, I'm getting really stressed
out with these everyday problems. You have grown up, you are
responsible too and married too. If you think that this is the
solution to all your problems then okay, you may get a separate home. Dad, honestly, I never wanted
to be separated with you all. But the problems I am going
through since past few days, I think this is the best option And moving to a separate house doesn't
mean at all that I am leaving you guys. Look, this no doubt
that it's a huge decision. I pray to God that may this
decision be beneficial to you. Dad, I hope you have no objection. What objection can I have, son? -I mean you won't get angry, will you?
-No, not at all. You can get a separate home. I have already given too much
trouble to my kids with my decisions. Now you should take your own
decisions, I'm going to support you. Besides, you are not going to follow
your father's decisions all your life. A person has his own decisions too.
Do whatever you find right. I am with you. Always. Mom, I don't believe it. Zaid has told me that he is going
to get a separate home for us. This is so unbelievable. What have you said to him
that he agreed to it so easily? I have been dealing so many people everyday
since so many years. And he is just a kid. I just gave him some sense
and he understood it. That's it? That's why I tell you that if you'll follow
my advise you can tackle Zaid easily. Okay then, start advising me from today. I was just kidding. These things can't be learned
by someone's explaining. But yes, keep it in mind that instead of creating a scene,
deal your husband with patience, And even then if he doesn't listen to you?
Then what? Usually, all men are alike. At times they take time and at times
they listen to their wives right away. But yes, only few of them agree to it. It's not like Zaid doesn't listen to me. But at times I feel that he
prioritize his family over me. Dear, every relation in
a man's life is very important. But the closest relation
is the wife's relationship. But to get what you want, it's very important to see how his
mood is and if it's the right time. Mom, I can't do this family politics. To be honest, you know how blunt I am. If I don't like anything
I say it then and there. I'm not into all this
planning and plotting. That's your biggest mistake.
You do all things bluntly. You know, until your father was
alive, he was totally under my control. Wow, mom, you're so smart! But anyway, my life is going
to be set now. I'm not worried. No, the game has just started. Just wait and watch how I play this game. I have just got the roof separated
now. Then I will get Aima divorced too. so that he doesn't
have any way to return. And then I have to crush
Azmat Hussain's pride. I am going to make him
yearn to even look at his son. Auntie, tell your son to stop. -Is everything all right? What happened?
-Your son is fooling around with girls. How can you say that? Whatever I'm saying is the truth. He keeps talking to girls all day long,
meet them privately and what not. Nosheen, how can you talk
like that about your husband? I'm not just accusing him. I
have proof of all his cheap deeds. Whatever you say, I know
that my Faiq isn't like that. Oh come one, leave it. I know your
son's character more than you do. You can see for yourself. He was supposed to get married
to Aima but still he went after me. Your son walks with
his heart on his sleeve. And it's in his nature to have affairs. I know, Nosheen, that whatever
Faiq did with Aima was very wrong. But he wasn't married then.
He is a married man now. He can't do anything like that. A person's nature doesn't
change after getting married. No, I trust Faiq, he would never do that. You may trust him, but I don't. And didn't you see how he broke
your trust by getting married to me? And still you have so
much hopes from that guy? Anyway, tell your son that if he
does any silly thing with me again, I won't spare him this time. No, Nosheen, there must
be a misunderstanding. Neither I nurture misunderstandings,
nor vain hopes like you. Tell him that I won't spare him this
time if he does anything wrong to me. And I'm not Aima to
tolerate everything quietly. Just tell him that I am going to
ruin his life if he deceives me. I won't let him worthy
enough to face anybody. Understand this yourself too and
make him understand it as well. Hammad has left already, and now him. Aima, no matter how much we try not to
have expectations from our children, but there is something in our
heart which gives us hope, no matter how brave,
how independent they get. It feels this way when
you reach a certain age. But I feel that I don't have the
joy of my children in my fate. Dad, why are you saying that? What shall I say then? I am
sharing with you what I'm feeling. Just don't lose heart. Because after Hammad left,
I was counting on Zaid. And now he will leave too. So, what did he say exactly?
Didn't you stop him? No, I gave him permission. He is helpless, Aima. And by stopping
him I can't make it more difficult for him. And you are the one who made me realized
that there is a lot of pressure on him. -Dad, I didn't mean that. I was just...
-I'm not blaming you, Aima. In fact I am happy about the fact that I am
trying to change myself even in this age. I can feel your pain. I am not sad because he is leaving, Aima. I am sad about the fact that we make so
many plans, but something else happens. And whatever happens,
that is God's planning. So how can God's planning be wrong? You are right, even then we humans
get worried if our planning gets disturbed. That's the weakness of our faith, dad. We claim that we trust God. But do we endure his decisions? Yes, you are right. Us humans are too weak in this regard. We lose hope and courage too soon. Anyway, if he thinks that he is going
to stay happy being apart from me, then I will be happy in his happiness. Dad, I will try my best that you
don't feel his absence here at home. This way your responsibilities will
increase, Aima. They weren't less as is. Not my responsibility, dad, it's my duty. Taking care of you, keeping you happy. What are you thinking? I'm thinking that
no matter how my life is, but your life has been ruined because
of my stubbornness and wrong decisions. To tell you the truth, I felt that your marriage got called
off because of my daughter. My son should makeup for it. I wasn't able to face my sister. I was afraid that she might... Anything which happens without
your will is actually God's planning. Then how can your decision be wrong then? May be God is taking our test. But now lead your life with your own will. I don't want to force
you guys for anything. I promise you that I am not
going to force anyone from now on. It's your life, you can take
your life's decision yourself. Dad, I have no objection
on any of your decisions. Nor did I ever had. Whatever decisions you have
taken for me, I am satisfied on them. And after God,
you are the only one I trust. No matter if anyone stays with you or not. Your daughter Aima is
going to stay with you. Stay blessed. God bless you. And, dad, whatever is happening, maybe it's a trial for us all. Sometimes God takes our
close relations away from us, so that they can get even closer to us. Faisal, for God's sake
stop doing such things. -That's because I love you.
-I am well aware of the love by you men. Why, what happened? All men in the world are
liars, deceitful and cheaters. Why? Did you husband cheat on you? If I tell him this, he is going
to blackmail me even more. No, it's nothing like that. What is it then? At least tell
me. May be I can help you. I said, it's nothing. Nothing at all. It's nothing, but your face
is telling something else. -I told you Faisal, it's nothing like that.
-Then why do you seem so worried? -Because of you.
-Because of me? -But what did I do?
-Why do you call me to meet all the time? That's because I miss you. Look, Faisal, these things
won't make any difference now. I don't want to keep
any relationship with you. When did I ask you to have
an illicit relationship with you? Then what are you saying? What
do you want? I just don't get you. Look, Nosheen I just want
to stay friends with you. And such a friendship which never ends. Yes, but I don't want even that. But I want to, Nosheen. And that's why you will have to also. I get it how you are
trying to blackmail me. No, I swear upon you. I would
never do such a thing with you. I promise. Don't you even try thinking about it. And remember, if I tell my husband about
you, he is going to blow your head off. Really? You have got me scared. -Shut up, Faisal, I'm leaving.
-Please, Nosheen, stay for a little longer. -Faisal, leave my hand, someone might see.
-Come on, just a little more. Roll down your window. For God's sake don't say
anything, he is my brother. Brother? Hello, brother. Nosheen, who is this? And what's going on? -Brother, he is a friend.
-We are friends. Nosheen, get out of the car, right now. -What is it Nosheen?
-Nothing, brother. Tell me honestly, who was that boy? Brother, it's noting. I just got out of
mother's home and met him on my way. He said, I'll drop you, 
so I just sat with him. Then why was he
holding your hand? You are suspecting me for
no reason, it's nothing like that. He was just joking. -Nosheen, are you sure?
-Definitely. Just relax, there is no issue. Just like a roller coaster. Look, Nosheen, I still don't believe you. If there is any problem then
let me know. I'll take care of him. Come on brother. You get sentimental
over everything. Everything is just fine. Okay, tell me how is married life? Is your husband okay? Really? When you left home,
didn't you think of this then? You know that I had some issues with dad. And there are a few other issues
too which I can't tell you right now. Who doesn't have issues with dad? Why? Is there any problem again? Didn't I tell you how dad treated me? I just had to get married for 
the heck of it, just because of dad. If he hadn't done all that with me,
I wouldn't have been stuck here. Nosheen, I am getting really
confused with what you are saying. I don't understand anything. Don't get confused. Just
take care of your own life. Anyway, tell me did your
fights with you wife end or not? Not the fights, I have ended my relationship with her. What? Really? Nosheen, this was the only solution I had. This means all three of us
siblings have a life full of drama? -What do you mean?
-I mean that Zaid is leaving the home with Zoya. What? Does he have an issue with dad too? No, not with dad, that poor guy
is stuck between both his wives. Whoever pulls him wherever, he goes there. You know what? Actually this is sad. It's so unfair to Aima. Well, it's not like that. She jumped into
this pit even after she knew everything. Why did she have to marry
an already married man? Yes, but there must be some obligation. Brother, there wasn’t any obligation. No matter how much dad would
have insisted, she could have said no. But she was getting the chance of
her life, why would have she said no? Aima is not like that, Nosheen. I don't know why the men in our
home think of Aima as so pious. It's simple. She loved Zaid, and when she
got a chance she married him. Anyway, listen, have you
told anyone about me at home? No, brother, I have
buried this secret in me. Thank you. By the way, brother, why do you
hide that you are in touch with me? I just don't want that anybody
gets to know anything about me. So won't you ever return home? Mother, this girl has lost
her mind, it's nothing else. Faiq, if she is saying it
with so much confidence, there must be something that she felt. Mother, it's nothing like that.
And you know Sania very well. Anyway, you aren't that naive. Look, whatever you want to say, if
you'll say it clearly it would be better. Your son is having an affair with a
girl and you aren't even aware of that? Salman there's this thing, 
people are right, life isn't easy. Stop it, man. You have been
talking philosophy since so long. Life isn't that difficult. We are much better than many
others. You should be thankful. You are right. And I have just one suggestion for you now. That do whatever you feel happy about. -Are you happy?
-Me? Where did my happiness come in this?
