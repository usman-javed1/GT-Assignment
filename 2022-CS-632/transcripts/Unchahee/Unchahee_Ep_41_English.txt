From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you You are blindfolded my your mother's love. And you are unable to see anything. But it's okay. What ever I do for you both,
I can never be good enough. Listen, where is Zaid? Is he happy? Of course, Mom, why wouldn't he be happy? Okay, now be careful,
someone might create a drama. You have been so strangely since I have
returned home. Are you in your senses? What do you care?
All you care about is your mother. Mind your language, got it? This is how I talk. Then do one thing,
get up from here and get lost. As if you are so well-mannered.
Have you ever noticed your tone? My tone gets bad when
your attitude gets bad. Dad, I have collected all their feedback
and emails of our deliveries to them. I'm sure it's going to help
Zaid a lot when he goes there. That's great. Yes, Dad, they have given very satisfactory
replies regarding their deliveries. Now, Zaid just has to go
there and convince them that our deliveries and quality 
has gotten better than before so that they think ten times before
giving this project to any other vendor. I am sure that they are
going to give this project to us. Because we have never disappointed them. In fact we have given urgent deliveries
to them too when they demanded. We just have to bring this in
notice of their top management. Because I'm sure that
their marketing team wants to give this project to
some of their own vendor. But the top management only wants
good quality and timely deliveries. Okay then, you can convince
them too like that when you go there . -Me?
-Yes, dear. You are going to accompany
?Zaid too and I'm sure that you both are going to
be back with a good news. Yes, but me and Zaid? Any problem with that Aima? I don't know but may be
Zoya and Zaid won't like it. Zoya has no right to object on this matter. Like she is his wife, so are you. SO, you don't need to be scared of anyone. I have got both your flight booked, get your packing done, spend two days
there and then get back. But, Dad. I'm telling you, just get
ready and leave the rest to me. Okay. Have some water, Zoya. Zoya! Mom, you were right. I was always wrong. They are never going to let me be happy. And Zaid is just like a puppet. He doesn't think about
anything else than his dad He does what his dad says, 
he thinks only what his dad decides. I don't want to talk to him. 
Mom, I am not going to go there. Mom, please I don't want to go back there. Relax, my dear. Give yourself time. -Tell me, have you eaten anything?
-No, I haven't -Okay, but why are you crying?
-Because I made a mistake. Calm down, Zoya! I can't trust that man. I don't want to go. -Mom, I don't want to go there.
-Calm down, Zoya. This is my final decision, Mom. Zoya, this is not some play of your
university. It's your life, be serious! You don't take such decisions 
on such small things. This isn't a small thing. Whatever is happening is your own decision. You knew it that Aima has entered
Zaid's life and still you went back. Do you remember? Didn't I tell you that you won't be
able to tolerate this relationship. But you said no, I want to go there, I am going to face everything,
I will handle everything. You are not supposed to leave your
home like that on such petty issues. What should I do then? Be brave. My daughter isn't that weak. You will have to face all of them. Until this old woman is in our lives, 
nothing can be right. Where were you? I have
been calling for so long. Why were you calling me? 
I didn't ask you to call me. What do you mean, why was I calling? You are away for the last two
hours and I shouldn't even call you? That's what I am saying, why were you
calling? You should have gone to sleep What nonsense, Faiq? I'm your wife, I was worried about you. Please, Nosheen, you don't need
to worry about me at all, understood? Okay, tell me where have you been? I went to find some peace 
that I am unable to get here. Oh, okay, means I'm
destroying your peace? You're right. Since you have come to this house, you
have destroyed the peace of this house. Wow, great, you are blaming
me when you are the one at fault. What does that mean? What wrong have we done to you? That's the problem. since I have come to this house, neither
you guys have given me any respect, nor you have made me
feel like I am a new bride. I am working like a mule 
since I have come here, and listening to scoldings 
by you and your mother. Nosheen, you don't do any difficult work. An if one doesn't feel like
then every work seems difficult. And as far as scolding is concerned, you should think yourself why do
you get scolded over everything. What is it that you do to us? Is that what I should do all
day to think like an idiot what is it that you and your
mother treat me this way? Well, there's nothing
wrong with that either. There is nothing much that you do all day. You are always busy with your
mobile, playing games, using Insta gram chatting with friends that's it. Enough, Faiq, you are saying too much. You should be thankful 
that I am just saying right now. Keep your threats to yourself. I am not scared of your threats, nor
am I scared of your threats to hit me. These aren't just threats, Nosheen. 
The way you are misbehaving, I'm afraid these threats 
might turn into reality. Oh, hello, mister. This is 2022,
what do you think I won't do anything? -I am going to file a complain against you.
-Really? The way your conduct is, those you are going to complain
will slap you a few times themselves. -I didn't know that you are so cheap...
-Please, enough now, Stay here if you can lie quietly, 
or else you may leave the room. She is just coming. Should I get some tea made for you? No, auntie, it's okay. I'm sorry, auntie, your plan
couldn't happen because of me. Actually, there was 
an urgent issue in our business. Zoya, didn't even listen to me. 
She just got angry and came here. What's urgent and what's
important, it's for you to decide. Anybody could have taken care of the
issue at work, your dad could have done it. But you chose that over Zoya's happiness. I tried my best to find someone
who could go in my place but... it just didn't happen. It's okay, 
I have got your trip rescheduled. When you get back from
Islamabad you can go then. Thanks a lot. I just hope 
that Zoya is in a better mood now. I have cooled her down with so
much difficulty. I convinced her all night. That's why I asked you
to come in the morning. I can't thank you enough, 
thanks a lot auntie. But don't expect it from me every time. Sure, I understand. I always try to keep her happy but some
issue raises from somewhere every time. Try to avoid it next time. If God wills. Faiq is such a rude and ignorant person. Mama, I can't tell you, his mother is
nothing in compared to Faiq's cleverness. My fate is ruined. 
Oh, God where did I get married. Listen madam, why are you blaming God now? His nature tried it's best that
you don't jump into this hell. But you were your own enemy. You always thing I am the one who is wrong. Because you have committed this mistake. And I am the one facing
consequences for that through my husband
and thorough his sister. All you care is about yourself. 
Is anybody concerned about me too or not? There is a limit of being concerned, Nosheen. You come home crying
and wailing every other day. If you have married by your
own choice then try to cope now. Fine, I won't come here ever again. Okay, listen, just listen to me. Nosheen, we'll do something. Don't worry. -What are you going to do?
-I will talk to your father. When are you going to do that? Faiq
and his mother's rudeness have exceeded. There has been enough cruelty
on me, I can't take it anymore. Nosheen, now have a little patience. No, Mama, please talk to Dad 
to set them straight. What's going on here? Look, Azmat, my daughter is
going through such a bad time. See, they have held her like a hostage. See how she has lost weight and she
has got dark circles under her eyes too. Please talk to them so that they
don't dare to do anything to her again. You were a little unhappy with her and they thought of her 
as she doesn't have any backing. It doesn't make any difference
to me what they have thought and how they are treating her. thinking that she has no backing,
doesn't make any difference to me. If she has taken such a huge step,
she can handle her own matters too. Tell her clearly that if
she want to come here she should leave all her problems behind. No need to disturb the peace of my house. WE are going at Farhana's for dinner,
get ready on time, we shouldn't get late. He is right, Mama. He broke all my hopes. This is what's going to happen to me. If my own father 
is behaving with me like this, then the world is going to mistreat me too. Your dad is just angry, but he
really cares about you, Nosheen. Just stop it, Mama, I know how everyone is. -Isn't Aima ready yet?
-She is just coming, brother. -And where is Zaid and Zoya?
-I don't know, I didn't ask. If you haven't asked then go and ask them. It doesn't mean that if one is
invited to someone's place for dinner one should reach right
at the time of dinner. We have to get sweets on our way too. -He has come himself.
-Isn't Zoya ready yet? Zoya isn't coming. Not coming? What do you
mean, everything all right? Yes, actually she isn't feeling well, so... If she isn't well you should
have told us that before. We could have called 
her mother here at least. How are we going to
leave her at home alone? It's okay, Dad. She will stay alone. She can stay, but we have
some responsibility too. How can we leave her home like that? Brother, it's okay, you guys
go ahead, I'll stay back with her. Let me call Amber and ask her. Ask her, it would be better if she arrives. Okay do one thing, Zaid
and Aima you guys go ahead. We will come after Amber arrives. Yeah, go on. And you ask Zoya if she wants to wait till
Amber arrives or shall we drop her there. -Okay let me ask her.
-Yeah, go find out Faiq. What's happened? Everything all right? Nothing, mom. Then why are you sitting here? -Just like that.
-Did you have breakfast? No. -Where is Nosheen?
-I don't know. What is the problem with you two, Faiq? You both were fighting so much even
last night, there was so much noise. Is this a good thing to fight like that? I don't know,I am fed up
myself with these fights everyday. Then why are you prolonging
this matter? Find a solution. Mother, this girl has lost her
mind. It's no use talking to her. What do you mean Faiq? Means all this is going to
go on like this all your life? I don't know. Faiq, find out the root cause 
of the fight between you two. You both have married 
each other by your own choice, then why so many differences suddenly? As far as I am concerned, I have always tried not
to interfere in your matter. Mom, I just don't get it But in the past few months
this girl has driven me crazy. She has such a childish attitude. She thinks of life as party time. If you go out for shopping, or eat out or
keep going places then everything is fine. And if any of it doesn't happen
then she starts behaving weirdly. And you know what, she is after me that because his brother and Zoya are
going on a honeymoon so we should go too. And I have told her that if they are going
it isn't necessary that we should go too. And she is fighting with me after
that. She isn't listening to me at all. Faiq, that girl always 
had a childish mentality. But she is your choice. 
You made this decision yourself. And one one takes a decision, 
one should own it too. Okay, just listen, no need to be so sad. There isn't an understanding in
every relation since the beginning. You have to give it some time. Just sit with her, talk to her
and find a solution the problem. -Mom, can I ask you something?
-Sure. Are you still angry with me? Time heals every wound, dear. It's your life. Whatever decision you have
taken for it must be better. Okay, just wait, 
I'll get breakfast for you. Faiq I'm crying because I
am going to be married soon. I will be moving to your home. Zoya's farewell reminded me of my farewell. That's why I got emotional. -Are you sure that is just it?
-Why would I hide anything from you? No, I'm not worried. I just came to say that if there
is anything you share it with me. Anything that you want to
discuss with me, I'm there. Faiq, I didn't get what
you are trying to say. Aima, I think you are
hiding something from me. Why would I hide anything from you? I have noticed that you are pretty
disturbed during the whole wedding. And I didn't think of it as normal. I just told you that Zoya's farewell
reminded me of my farewell. I got teary just to think about the fact
that I am going to miss them all so much. The people in this house,
the time spent here, my family. That girl kept saying nonsense
and you kept listening quietly? Tell me, is that recording all true? Have you been meeting her privately?
Talking to her secretly? Tell me, Faiq, I want to
hear the truth from you. It's true, mother. I don't like Aima but Nosheen, 
and want to get married to Nosheen too. And you are telling me this now? When you are here to marry Aima? You have disgraced me, Faiq. I have promised Shabana
and brother Azmat that my son isn't going
to decline what I ask. You have been fooling me. You should have told
me if you didn't like Aima. I would have called off this marriage. But that poor girl's life wouldn't
have been ruined like this. You have no idea about 
the consequences of what you have done. I have told the driver, he will
drop you guys to the airport. You guys? Who else is coming with me? Aima is going with you. I have made you hotel reservations and asked
Mr. Sheikh to arrange a car for you too. You guys can move around and
enjoy after the meeting, all right? I'll just be back. There is not much time
left before the flight leaves. -I'll be right back.
-Okay. Now go for what you were
going, there is just an hour left. No, Dad, it's not needed anymore. Okay, fine. Durrani, put
this luggage in the car. Okay, son, may God be with you.
Come on. Take care of your self. Who is it? I'm busy right now, you can
come and do the cleaning later. Oh, man! What the hell. Oh, mom, did you want something?
Faiq has already left. I know, but I want something from you. From me? Everything all right? Can I come in? I have to talk to you. Yes, sure please come in, sit down. Please sit. You guys have been
married just for a few days and you guys fight with
each other on every little thing. That's not a nice thing. You must be happy, 
isn't that what you wanted? Why? Why should I be happy? Because your son didn't
marry your beloved one. Nosheen, I have told you so many times
that all that was with Faiq's own will. I have never imposed my will on him. Anyway, what's done is done. But now you both are husband and wife. And you both should spend your
lives with love and understanding. Understanding? That can only happen
when you are going to let that happen. Why? Why wouldn't I want it? Every mother wants that
her children stay happy. And I love Faiq a lot. Every mother loves her child the
same, you don't do anything new. You are absolutely right, 
this is how a mother is. Okay, now forget everything 
and come with me. I am going to help you in the kitchen and
you can make something of Faiq's choice. He'll get happy. Thank you so much, but please excuse me. If your kitchen gets dirty again
you will poison Faiq against me again. What is the way your are
talking to me, Nosheen? Why would I do that? I have told you I don't want to do
anything which may hurt my son. I just want to see him happy. I have told you, it's my final decision
that I won't enter the kitchen now. Now you may leave. Where are we going? What happened? -For shopping.
-Why? Zaid! I just told you that we
are going for shopping because I talked to mama and she said
that we should keep warm clothes with us. I have mine, but I think
you don't have any. So, let's go for shopping. 
Shall we go right now? Zaid, is there a problem? -Hmm.
-Hmm , again? Tell me, what happened? Zoya, we are not going on the trip. -Wait, Zoya.
-Leave my hand. Zoya, just try to understand
me, at least listen to me. Zaid, I don't want to
listen to anything you say. Zoya, I swear it's not my fault, 
I compelled to. You may stay compelled for life. Zoya, I'm really sorry,
please try to understand. I said leave my hand. Zoya! Zoya, what have you decided then? I don't know, Mom. But you have to choose any one of them. I made up my mind for
Daniyal after thinking so much. And now Zaid has come in between. My brain is just messed up. But you have to take a decision. I will need some time. I can't take a decision in such haste. But you have to, Zoya. Just give me some time. The problem is that the boy's
family is visiting tomorrow. And if you choose Zaid, I am not
calling them just to have dinner with us. Two heroes have entered
my life at once in my life. Idiot, your hero is going
to be any one of them. Mom, you have met Daniyal too and Zaid too. If I ask you to think, 
whose side will you be one? It's difficult. See! I was just asking you and
you have given up just now. It's the question of my life. Don't you dare bring my
daughter, Nosheen, between all this. I won't tolerate. You mother and daughter
always bring Nosheen in between. Oh, God! Auntie, please leave
before I lose my temper. Oh, so you are going to
kick me out of my own house? This is my house and you
should keep that in your mind. You are supposed to tie it like that, okay? Nice watch. Come on let's go, hurry up. -Get up.
-Okay. You won't give up like that. I'll just give
your number to cybercrime department. Nosheen! -Who?
-It's me, Faisal.
