[0.07] From flowers and from buds
[4.64] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.23] When I saw you
[14.38] I learned to chirp from you
[19.43] Who are you? This is my husband's number.
[25.17] What? How? How is he doing now?
[32.33] Nosheen, who was it on the phone?
[35.59] -Aren't you angry with me, Aima?
-Why would I be angry with you, Nosheen?
[40.43] You know, I have always
deliberately given trouble to you.
[46.70] I have always teased you deliberately.
[49.67] I have decided to divorce Aima.
[52.78] Why are you leaving her, Zaid?
[55.75] Just because I don't like her?
[58.16] Or because I am going to
be the mother of your child?
[63.14] If that's the case then
[67.68] I have lied to you.
[74.05] I'm not expecting.
[93.72] Zoya, when did you come?
[96.37] Just a while ago.
[99.46] Please, come, sit with me.
[103.37] No, I haven't come to sit down.
[110.00] I'm just here to end the game.
[112.73] -Which game?
-The game which I was playing.
[117.87] The game which was
going on between us three.
[125.12] Don't worry, I won't
tell anything to Zaid.
[131.62] I know it. You can't even tell.
[138.56] Because you aren't like me, Aima.
[141.27] I could have gone to
any extent to have Zaid.
[147.34] And you might not hate me so much
[150.89] as much I had started hating you.
[153.69] Zoya, don't worry
everything is going to be all right.
[161.50] Zaid will start loving
you like he used to.
[166.47] Yeah, I know.
[169.38] I have come here to
make everything all right.
[173.09] I have told Zaid the whole truth.
[182.39] He will never be able to love me again.
[191.18] I have lost him, Aima.
[194.83] Are you
[198.46] going to stay friends with me?
[240.80] I know that it is something absurd
[243.56] but there is no other solution
available other than this.
[247.12] Yes, brother, if the
kids have no objection
[251.52] why would I object then?
[255.55] -You have made a very wise decision.
-Yes.
[259.81] -Didn't you like it?
-No, brother.
[263.26] I feel that Aima may stay happy.
[270.37] Because the way Hammad has talked to me,
I feel that he is going to keep Aima happy.
[277.34] I feel the same too.
[279.71] Where is Almas?
[280.96] She has gone to the
orphanage to feed the children.
[284.26] Oh, okay.
[286.69] -Brother, I'm really happy today.
-Really? Why is that?
[294.05] No matter what attitude
sister has kept with me,
[298.81] but now she has cleared my
heart from her side by apologizing.
[303.75] It's good, she realized it late
but at least she did.
[309.20] Yes, brother.
[312.28] realizing the fact that we are at
fault, not every one can do that.
[318.19] Otherwise, everyone here is
after finding other people's faults.
[323.24] Yes, that's true.
[327.35] Oh, sister Nimra, please come, sit.
[334.79] I have to talk to you about
something very important.
[337.29] If it is about leaving this house then
I am not going to listen to it at all.
[342.11] Yes, he is absolutely right. You are
not going to go anywhere from here.
[347.41] This is all your love and care.
[350.22] But, Shabana, I'll have to go
one day. It's been so many days.
[355.69] This is like your own home too,
isn't it? What's the problem then?
[358.79] I don't think its appropriate
to send you there.
[362.20] You are absolutely right.
[364.48] But don't worry, I am not
staying here,
[367.35] in fact I am going to go to Canada
to live with Asim in a few months.
[372.21] Okay.
[374.76] Yes, and I wanted to
talk to you in this regard.
[379.55] Sure, please go ahead.
[382.95] Actually, if you don't have any objection
I want to take Nosheen with me too.
[391.82] See, that's fine but...
[393.66] Oh, I understand your concern very well.
[397.45] But Nosheen is my
responsibility more than you.
[400.45] And I have talked to
Asim in this regard as well.
[405.04] I didn't get you.
[406.48] Actually, Asim wants to
own Nosheen with her child.
[414.70] Oh, that's great news.
[418.46] Your house will get together
once again, that will be great.
[422.05] Yeah, Shabana,
[424.34] my heart used to sink
when I watched Nosheen.
[427.55] The sorrow of being a
widow at such a young age.
[430.27] And then, where will she
go with such a small child?
[435.02] But to tell you the truth, what Asim has
said today has taken the burden off of me.
[440.49] But tell me, have you put
any pressure on Asim to do it?
[445.73] No, not at all. This thing
didn't even cross my mind.
[452.39] He has said it himself to me that I
am going to own my brother's child.
[459.44] When God gives us sorrow then He also
grants us the courage to bear it as well.
[465.41] And He heals the sorrow too.
[470.54] No doubt, that's how it is.
[486.87] My body burns by the sorrow
That I have draped myself with
[492.87] I have learned to burn
when I saw the fire burning.
[501.22] Why did I become unwanted
[505.88] Nobody knows that
[510.48] Even you don't know it
[515.33] And I don't know it either.
[539.04] When I think of being apart from you
I get afraid.
[548.30] I have learned to walk after
you have held my hands.
[556.57] Why did I become unwanted
[561.26] Nobody knows that
[565.91] Even you don't know it
[570.76] Just my God knows it
[579.91] -It's okay.
-No.
[583.18] It's not okay.
[585.89] You were right, I shouldn't have lied.
[592.19] But. Mom, everything is fine now.
[595.41] Besides, I have told Zaid the whole truth.
[598.95] And honestly it feel so light.
[603.37] Seems as if I have
taken a burden off of me.
[608.31] I went to sister's home.
[613.03] -When?
-I just got back from there.
[617.43] Then?
[618.63] I have said sorry to sister,
brother Azmat and Zaid too,
[624.27] and I told them that
you have got no fault in it,
[627.66] everything has
happened because of me.
[629.73] You didn't need to do that.
[631.28] It was needed. Everyone
shall know the truth.
[634.91] -But what difference does it make now?
-What if it does make a difference?
[639.28] Mom, I have had a lot
of expectations in life.
[643.39] May be that's why I have
always been disappointed.
[647.85] But now, I have thought that
I am going to expect nothing,
[651.98] and will leave everything
to God, like Aima does.
[658.78] I will pray for you.
[662.16] Thank you, Mom. That's
the best gift I can get.
[670.34] Mom! Please don't cry.
[675.34] Mom, if you are going to do
that, what am I going to do then?
[679.69] -I love you.
-I love you too dear.
[696.42] Yes, Zaid, that's the truth.
[701.31] Aima, why didn't you
tell this to me earlier?
[705.15] I have hidden it not just
from you but from myself too.
[715.57] I didn't want anybody to
know that I am in love with you.
[723.09] But even after knowing that
it could have been possible,
[728.01] you told me to marry Zoya?
[733.48] But why?
[736.13] Because I am unwanted to you. Zaid.
[743.04] I am in love with you
but you don't love me.
[748.89] -But, Aima.
-You love Zoya only. and that's the truth.
[758.48] The rest are just compromises.
[763.81] Everyone wants to be
together with the one they love
[767.41] but nobody would want to
stay unwanted in someone's life.
[775.63] If I have any sorrow in
my heart, it's just that,
[783.37] that I am unwanted for you.
[786.54] And I don't want to live like that.
[788.80] I'm sorry, Aima.
[791.76] I have hurt you so much, unknowingly.
[794.75] It's okay Zaid.
[796.68] Excuse me, I hope I am not intruding.
[800.84] No, please come.
[804.86] Aima, if you don't mind, can you
get me a glass of water, please?
[809.25] I'll get it.
[815.61] Zaid, what have you decided?
[821.01] You must be thinking why am I after you?
[824.48] No, it's not like that.
[828.49] Zaid, actually I wanted
to say something to you.
[834.67] Sure, go ahead.
[839.90] I'm sure you are worried
[842.30] that what is going to happen
to Aima if you will divorce her?
[849.69] Yes, that's what I'm worried about.
[852.70] If Aima has no fault why
shall she be punished?
[861.84] You know it well,
[864.51] nobody owns a divorced
girl in this society.
[872.59] Zaid, if I assure you
[876.98] that Aima won't stay alone, then?
[879.59] Will it be easier for
you to take a decision?
[894.70] You got it right.
[898.38] Zaid, I...
[901.06] want to own Aima.
[908.02] I mean, if she has no objection.
[914.08] Thank you so much!
[959.53] Nosheen. my dear.
[963.86] Oh, God! You are the most
merciful and benevolent.
[969.15] Please reduce our sorrows, oh, God.
[973.44] What's wrong, Mama?
Why are you crying like this?
[977.33] See, even me and auntie
have stopped crying now.
[980.09] These tears are pouring out
themselves, they are God's blessing
[984.61] that he keeps pouring on us.
[988.23] He keeps blessing me even after my sins.
[992.35] Mama, why are you
saying all this? I don't get it.
[996.67] I am so fortunate that
God hasn't punished me.
[1002.42] What has happened, Mama?
[1004.38] Nimra has asked your
hand in marriage for Asim.
[1009.39] What is wrong with you guys?
[1011.25] It is my life, and you didn't even
find it necessary to even ask me?
[1015.71] Yes, Asim has said it himself to Nimra.
[1017.95] Asim is my brother in law.
[1020.17] Don't you guys even have
any regard for relationships?
[1022.72] The reason because of which that
relationship existed, he isn't there anymore.
[1028.43] That too much, Mama. Nobody even forgets
the death of some stranger so soon,
[1034.62] as soon you have forgotten
my husband's death.
[1040.36] No, it's not like that. Faiq
will always be in or hearts.
[1045.35] No ifs and but. I'm telling you
nothing of this sort will happen.
[1050.35] Nosheen, you have your whole
life ahead, and then a child too.
[1054.67] How are you going to manage
[1059.13] yourself and the kid, all by yourself?
[1061.31] That is going to be my child, I don't
need anybody to take care of him.
[1069.15] And if I am a burden
on you then let me know.
[1074.41] I am not going to stay here as is.
[1076.34] I am going to live with my mother
in law at my husband's house.
[1080.06] Even you mother in law
is not going to stay here,
[1082.12] Asim has called her to Canada as well.
[1085.02] Iâ€™ll stay alone then,
I have told you I don't need anyone.
[1088.70] Nosheen you are just being
emotional and sentimental right now.
[1092.73] But you guys don't have
any regard of my emotions.
[1095.59] It's hurting me, Mama.
[1101.50] Why can't you guys understand?
[1106.71] Don't cry like this, Nosheen,
I have never seen you crying like this.
[1111.86] Today when my own daughter is crying my
heart is breaking and getting distressed.
[1118.34] I am getting it now that
[1121.42] the mothers whose
daughter I have hurt to date
[1127.62] how would have been they feeling.
[1132.42] Don't cry.
[1133.83] I told you Mama, you get
re-compensated of your deeds in this world.
[1138.45] What goes around comes around.
[1142.66] I have understood it now, Nosheen,
[1144.95] that's why I have asked for forgiveness
from your auntie, Aima and Amber.
[1153.75] I have hurt all of them.
[1156.63] You did very right, one feels less
burdened by asking for forgiveness.
[1161.68] One feels relieved.
[1163.22] Nosheen, I know you must
have complaints from me.
[1168.18] I haven't raised you
like I was supposed to.
[1174.46] Your father is right, I am
an unsuccessful mother.
[1179.55] No, Mama, it's not like that.
[1182.30] What is done I can't change it.
[1188.01] But I will try that this
doesn't happen again.
[1191.96] Maybe God is giving me a chance to repent.
[1195.23] Yes, Mama, God always keeps the door
open for repentance for His people.
[1200.84] Will you agree to something I ask?
[1203.23] Mama, please don't ask me
something that I can't agree to.
[1208.71] Okay, but at least listen to me.
[1213.27] Nosheen, you have always done what you
wanted and I have always supported you.
[1217.51] Today, for once, for all of us elders'
sake, please say yes to Asim's proposal.
[1226.95] All of us including your Dad, Nimra,
[1230.05] both your brothers, we are so
happy about knowing this proposal.
[1233.90] But, Mama, I can't do this.
[1237.23] Nosheen, not only for you but this
proposal is good for you unborn child too.
[1244.21] The way Asim is going to
raise your child and love him,
[1247.50] no other person in
the world can do it.
[1256.24] One more thing,
nobody is going to force you.
[1260.33] If you still decide against it,
nobody is going to force you.
[1265.85] I will still wait for your response.
[1268.72] Think over it , take your time.
[1272.15] And Nosheen, am I standing by
you even today, I will support you.
[1280.98] Oh, God! I have never
asked you anything like this.
[1285.56] I don't even know how to
ask for something properly.
[1288.73] I am unable to take any decision.
[1291.49] I am getting so restless.
[1294.16] It isn't easy to take some decisions.
[1298.23] Oh God, why don't you help me?
[1300.85] Please help me make a decision.
[1304.17] The decision which is
right for me and my child.
[1317.47] Yes, Amber, just pray that
Aima and Hammad's wedding
[1319.40] brings happiness to us all.
[1321.60] Honestly, I am really
happy with this decision
[1325.34] and I have sincerely accepted
Aima as my daughter in law.
[1330.19] Please Amber, pray for my Nosheen
that God returns her happiness.
[1336.15] Okay Amber, I'll call
you in a while, okay? Bye.
[1344.12] -Have you eaten?
-Yes.
[1347.48] I didn't feel like eating but I still did,
because I can't just think about myself.
[1352.82] The one who is breathing inside
me I have to think about him too.
[1356.31] You're right, it's not easy to be a
mother, and every mother tries that...
[1362.92] Nosheen, are you thinking about something?
[1364.83] Just that what one thinks
and what happens instead.
[1368.73] Nosheen, this is what
is called God's will.
[1373.61] Nimra came to me a while ago and
was asking what Nosheen has decided.
[1378.78] Auntie came to me too.
[1380.91] -Really? What did she say?
-The same what you said.
[1385.30] Zaid and Hammad were
saying the same to me.
[1389.01] -Did you dad talk to you too?
-Yeah, he came to me too.
[1393.40] He is very worried about you. We all
can't see you sad like this, Nosheen.
[1399.23] Mama, I know that you all love me a lot.
[1404.24] If you do then tell me,
what have you decided?
[1406.91] What should I tell Nimra?
[1410.58] You all wanted me to say yes, right?
[1415.25] -No, we just...
-I accept this proposal.
[1420.49] Nosheen, I hope you aren't taking
this decision because we all want it.
[1424.95] -No, Mama.
-Then?
[1427.80] I prayed to God that whatever
decision is right for me and my child
[1434.15] He shall put it in my heart.
[1438.18] And then I thought that I have
never listened to my elders before.
[1444.93] I thought that I should say yes.
[1451.33] And after thinking over it
and making this decision
[1456.69] I have a feeling that I have
made the right decision.
[1460.41] Are you serious?
[1463.44] Yes.
[1464.59] Does this mean that you
are happy with this decision?
[1527.14] What are you thinking?
[1530.59] Life is...
[1535.62] Zaid, you?
[1538.07] Yeah, me, but what is there
to be so surprised about?
[1541.23] No, actually, I wasn't expecting you.
[1545.52] Okay.
[1547.23] So, I'll leave then.
[1549.21] No, I didn't meant to say that.
[1555.48] Okay, I'll stay then.
[1569.53] Zoya, come with me,
I have come to take you.
[1572.84] -But...
-No ifs and buts, not questions.
[1577.96] Come with me.
[1580.35] And I won't let you go anywhere this time.
[1584.88] Does this mean that you have forgiven me?
[1587.38] To err is human.
[1590.63] But if God forgives why
can't humans forgive?
[1597.31] Zoya I had made a lot of promises
to you which I couldn't fulfill.
[1601.74] That's why I am making
no promise this time.
[1606.69] But I will try my best that
you don't get hurt all your life.
[1614.73] And we stay happily like this.
[1622.48] I will also try, Zaid, that Aima
has no complains from me.
[1629.37] Now come, we're getting late,
we have to make preparations too.
[1631.76] But where? What preparations?
[1635.62] Nosheen is going to Canada.
[1638.76] Yes, Faiq's brother lives there so he
has called both auntie and Nosheen there.
[1644.38] -Oh!
-Auntie will get Asim and Nosheen married there.
[1648.78] Oh, that's a good news.
[1652.59] And...
[1661.48] And then, here...
[1664.38] Hammad and...
[1666.84] Hammad and Aima will get married as well.
[1671.18] What?
