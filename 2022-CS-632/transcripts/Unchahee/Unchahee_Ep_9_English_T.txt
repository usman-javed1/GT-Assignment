[0.10] From flowers and from buds
[4.65] I have learnt to bloom
and be fragrant
[9.31] When I saw you
[14.41] I learnt how to chirp from you
[18.90] It's the same guy who
messaged me the other day.
[22.09] He has been sending me messages since
last night, I have just had it with him.
[25.84] -Who is it?
-I don't know.
[29.95] So, what is he saying?
[45.39] Aima, from where did this guy
get such private picture of yours?
[50.26] I don't know. Zoya.
[53.76] I don't know.
[55.76] Zoya he is a picture
of me where I am sleeping.
[59.48] And I have know idea who took
this picture of me sleeping and when,
[66.47] and how he got it.
[70.68] Look, I think you should
take him more seriously, okay?
[73.58] And you shouldn't come to university alone
like this. You should come with Aid.
[80.18] We don't know who he is and what he wants?
[83.46] I'm really scared, Zoya. I am too scared.
[88.77] Just  don't worry,
nothing is going to happen.
[93.96] Sit down. Oh, just a second.
 Hello. Yes, Haris?
[100.22] I asked you something to do.
[103.27] What? The number isn't registered,
how is it possible?
[111.41] Fine. Okay, by. Thank you.
[117.67] Aima, this guy is  something.
[120.30] We can't even track his number.
[123.13] I think he is after me for a reason.
[129.89] Just ask him what he wants.
[135.04] Zoya...
[139.28] He wants that I should meet him alone.
[142.65] And if I don't do it,
he is going to get my pictures viral.
[147.29] He has been threatening me a lot.
I am really scared, Zoya.
[153.14] Let's do one thing then, let's involve
the police. I have my sources.
[157.23] Okay, let's find him first
and then hand it over to the police.
[161.00] No, no. We can't do that.
[163.78] If this thing reaches the house, it's going
to be a huge trouble for me then, Zoya.
[169.62] What if he becomes my enemy after that,
and puts someone else after me?
[174.29] What am I going to do, Zoya?
 I am really scared.
[178.13] It's not going to work this way,
and then you haven't told Zaid either.
[183.93] If we don't do something about
that guy he is going to get crazy
[187.94] and will do whatever he likes.
[194.74] -Do one thing. Go meet him.
-No. I a not going to meet him alone.
[200.75] No, idiot, not alone.
[202.19] I mean, we will go together and meet
him and find out what he wants.
[207.04] I think this matter can't be solved easily.
[209.86] We can just try to know what he wants.
[213.03] Zoya, I... I don't want to take any risks.
[216.99] Aima, it's better to face him instead
of getting tortured everyday.
[221.48] And he has got your pictures too,
so he can do anything.
[228.73] That's true.
[230.85] Look, if we see his face once
then we can find out his name too
[235.05] and at least we will have
something to blackmail him.
[240.46] Don't worry, I am with you,
no need to be scared.
[245.99] You are right.
[249.53] Do one thing.
Decide a place and time, okay?
[253.15] I will come with you, okay?
[258.36] Okay?
[274.38] -Mother, what are you doing?
-Oh, dear,
[282.49] I got tired while sitting idle,
so I thought of doing some dusting.
[285.83] Mother, why don't you listen to anyone.
The doctor has instructed you to take rest.
[290.95] Nothing is going to happen.
One should do such small chores.
[295.87] Nobody can convince you.
[298.25] Okay let me freshen up and get back.
[300.44] Wait.
[303.62] Did something happen?
[307.95] No, what's wrong?
[310.42] Brother came to me.
Said, "Come to me after Aima gets back."
[316.26] He has to talk about something important.
[320.95] What is it? What are you thinking?
[324.01] No, nothing.
[326.31] Okay then go, change and we will go to him.
[331.75] Why do I need to change?
Let's go to him directly.
[335.38] Yes, that's okay too.
[356.10] Has it ever happened that I have
made a decision in this house
[358.89] -with which you don't agree to?
-No, brother.
[362.33] Did I ever differentiate
between you both and others?
[365.62] That's never happened. 
But why are you asking, brother?
[370.00] Because, Shabana, I want that not two 
but a single family lives in this house,
[374.78] and every person in the
house has equal importance.
[378.75] By the grace of God, brother, you
have never discriminated anyone,
[384.36] and you have given 
equal importance to everyone.
[386.70] But I think... I think that I haven't.
[394.06] I have realized that Almas and Nosheen
[396.60] have adopted an unfair behavior 
with you two.
[402.37] Is that true?
[404.83] No, brother, it's nothing like that.
[407.21] I have got no complains
with sister and Nosheen.
[410.67] And Nosheen is my child, 
whatever she says I never mind it.
[416.85] You tell me , Aima.
[419.66] She is never going to tell me the truth 
and I want to know the truth.
[422.79] At times, auntie and sometimes Nosheen,
[426.51] make us realize that this isn't our house.
[432.37] No, brother, she doesn't know anything, 
she is just a child.
[437.82] And you know she is a bit sensitive,
so takes every little thing to her heart.
[443.09] Why didn't you bring
 it to my attention then?
[446.63] You call me father.
[448.85] If I am in your father's place, then one
doesn't hide anything from their father.
[452.31] Yes, father. I don't tell it to you 
to keep the peace at home.
[458.41] It's my job to worry 
about the peace at home.
[462.05] If you both will stay quiet at
what is happening with you
[465.52]  then we are actually going 
to lose the peace of our home.
[468.74] I am the eldest in this house.
[471.09] So being the head of the family
I am answerable to God.
[474.60] Brother, I don't want to burden you 
with such petty issues.
[481.10] Shabana, I wish there was just this burden
in my life that you are burdening me with.
[498.40] Aima, who told brother, all this?
[504.40] Did you tell Zaid about it?
[509.82] Oh, Aima! At times you act really stupidly.
[516.32] What benefit would it give, tell me?
[519.01] In fact it will increase brother's problems.
[539.61] Sit here. I have to talk to you.
[543.68] Everything all right?
 Did the boy's family respond?
[547.57] -No.
-Then?
[551.87] You tell me that have I ever deprived
you or your children of their right?
[558.28] What kind of a question is this?
[559.86] -It is a question and you have to answer it.
-No
[564.19] And has it ever happened that there is 
any need of yours that I haven't fulfilled?
[570.53] Is everything all right?
[572.03] Answer the question that
I am asking, quietly.
[576.02] -Yes.
-In fact, I don't even remember
[579.35] that I have overlooked any of your needs,
 that I didn't fulfill.
[583.22] -It is like that.
-Have I asked anything in return?
[587.94] I am frightened now, Azmat, just tell me,
why are you creating so much suspense?
[592.79] All I have asked is just one thing 
and that is consideration.
[598.36] So, have I ever been inconsiderate to you?
[600.91] I am not talking about me, 
but about my sister and her daughter.
[606.01] I don't have anyone else in this
world other than my sister.
[609.95] Neither she is left
with any one else than me.
[613.77] You must understand that Shabana
lives here because she needs to.
[618.92] And I am as responsible 
for her as I am for you.
[622.18] Tell me, Azmat, what complain
 does Shabana have with me?
[626.18] Just accept Shabana and Aima. 
They are a part of this house.
[629.83] Till when are you going to keep
 these useless thoughts in your mind?
[632.94] If you value them sincerely, 
then they will love you too.
[636.31] Azmat, just tell me
what did she complain about me?
[640.98] This means that you have 
done something complain able.
[644.63] First tell me what they have told you.
[647.35] You leave that, and concentrate 
on what I have said.
[651.02] And tell Nosheen also to think
 of Aima as her sister.
[654.29] I try my best,
[656.43] but I don't know what special treatment
do you want me to give to your sister.
[660.77] If your behaviour was okay with them, there
would have been no room for complains.
[665.12] I don't understand what Shabana wants.
[667.24] She has been living here peacefully
 since so many years.
[669.80] She eats and wears the best,
what else do they want?
[672.61] This, exactly this. 
The way you are rubbing it in.
[676.85] Have you ever rubbed it 
in Nosheen's or Zaid's face?
[681.34] God doesn't give that right to anyone,
[683.59] and even if He did you wouldn't
have been entitled to it.
[686.72] Azmat, we spend two days
together with peace
[688.92] and my heart tells me that someone
is going to poison you eventually.
[691.55] What nonsense are you talking?
 Are you aware of what you are saying?
[695.75] Try to give peace to others 
and God will fill your heart with peace.
[700.44] Forget it. I am never going 
to get peace in this house.
[711.95] You are not even aware of what peace is.
[715.47] I don't know what kind
 of a test it is for me.
[717.30] Me and Azmat don't stay happy 
for four days together
[721.01]  and you bring up a new issue 
so that we start fighting again.
[726.94] Mother, please.
[728.68] If God has taken away your husband, 
what is my fault in it?
[732.81] Why have I become unwanted
[737.45] No body knows that.
[741.97] Why have I become unwanted
[746.83] No body knows that.
[762.05] Where is that guy? He isn't here yet.
[767.34] Message him.
[775.95] Look, I have messaged him,
 he didn't see it.
[780.66] -Come, let's leave. 
-Where to? Sit, he must be here somewhere.
[790.61] What are you doing?
[791.83] I am just checking that he might be
one of them. You should check too.
[797.67] Zoya, if someone sees us here
[799.52] then it's going to be a huge
trouble for us, come let's go now.
[802.29] Nothing is going to happen. 
Just try one last time.
[805.62] You have his other numbers, right?
[807.22] -Yes.
-Then try on them.
[809.83] But they are blocked.
[813.58] Oh, God, my child, you are so dumb.
[816.35] Unblock him, so that we know 
that we tried to contact him.
[829.94] Can't get through.
[833.85] I swear if someone had
done this with me,
[836.96] I would have broken his jaw,
and given him to the police.
[841.29] -Let's go.
-You are such a coward.
[844.61] Too coward. Let's go.
[863.90] Auntie, where is Aima?
[865.94] She has gone somewhere with Zoya.
[868.87] Zoya? Why didn't she tell me, 
did she tell you?
[872.09] She didn't tell me where she is going 
but she said that, " I will be back in a while."
[882.95] What happened? 
Did you get in contact with them?
[887.81] I am getting in contact but they
don't want to stay in contact.
[892.69] -Meaning?
-They are disconnecting my calls.
[896.87] Don't get angry, 
they will be back in a while.
[900.43] I don't know why they don't
tell me anything these days.
[903.58] Look, son, somethings are
between girlfriends only,
[907.28] and they should remain between them.
[912.13] You get so angry, huh. Look what this is.
[915.92] Oh, thank you, just what I wanted.
[921.09] Yes, I know it very well since your
childhood, why you come to my room.
[926.17] To get a chocolate.
[928.31] And to tell you the truth, 
I buy and keep chocolate for you only.
[932.65] I love you, auntie.
[939.21] Shabana, tell me clearly what do you want?
[942.57] That me and Nosheen should
get out of our own home?
[946.70] -What are you saying, sister?
-Exactly what you have heard,
[950.33] that you can't see us happy.
[952.79] -Mama, what are you talking about?
-Just keep quiet , Zaid.
[958.10] This dear auntie of yours is
poisoning your dad's ears against me.
[966.17] No, I haven't talked to brother.
[970.63] If you hadn't said anything, 
Azmat wouldn't have scolded me so much.
[976.00] The world may feel pity
on your miserable face,
[979.53] but don't you dare try this
cunningness in front of me.
[983.49] Look, sister you must be mistaken.
[986.60] Mama, look if you have to talk 
then please sit down and talk calmly.
[989.59] Me and Azmat don't stay happy
 for a few days,
[993.46] and you raise a new issue 
so that we both start fighting.
[999.21] Mama, please.
[1000.94] If God has taken away your husband
from you, what is my fault in it?
[1007.55] Why are you jealous of me and my husband?
[1011.37] Why do you cast an evil eye on him?
[1013.05] Mother, you have no right
to misbehave with auntie.
[1016.06] Please go from here.
[1017.75] I thought just my husband is
in your control only.
[1024.15] But you have also used my son against
me, like a pawn in the game of chess, see!
[1031.84] Mama, listen please,
go from here right now. Just leave.
[1036.76] I don't know what is wrong.
[1038.46] I am really sorry, auntie.
Let me talk to dad.
[1043.06] I'm really sorry, auntie, I...
[1066.54] Faisal, your editing is outclass. 
Aima must be sleepless with anxiety.
[1072.68] Yes she was showing too much attitude.
[1077.21] Since I sent her the pictures, 
she has fallen into my feet
[1079.65] You should give me the credit for that.
[1081.74] It was so difficult for me to take her
pictures in her room when she was asleep.
[1085.75] Don't let her be at ease even for a minute.
[1088.18] Don't worry about that at all, 
your work is being done properly.
[1092.84] Tell me, will she come to meet?
[1096.54] She will not go, she is gone to meet.
[1099.51] Anyways, I have sent Amir, 
let's see what does he report.
[1102.55] Man, I'm really happy. It's going to be so
much fun when she gets humiliated by dad.
[1107.68] By the way tell me one thing,
[1109.40] you are getting all this by Amir, right?
[1112.12] I hope you aren't talking to Aima yourself.
[1115.32] No why would I talk to her?
[1117.79] Because you get really excited when it
comes to girls, that's why I'm asking.
[1122.44] Come, on, it's not like that.
[1125.46] Don't you talk to any other girl, 
or else you know me well.
[1129.09] -Oh, so now you are threatening me?
-No I'm just showing love.
[1134.20] Anyways, when are we planning to meet?
It has been so many days now.
[1138.64] Faisal, are you in your senses? I have
gotten my phone after so much trouble,
[1142.90] that too mama's phone, 
and you are talking about meeting?
[1145.47] What's with a phone, if you say 
I can send you a new one right now.
[1150.15] Just send your proposal officially, 
when I tell you to.
[1152.85] Okay, listen, what about the money?
When are you going to transfer that?
[1157.29] Yeah, don't worry, I'll do it.
[1176.70] Where were you guys?
[1178.85] Couldn't find you both in the university,
[1181.10] and you weren't taking my calls either,
 what's going on?
[1185.28] Actually it was really crowded outside.
[1190.36] Where? Where was it crowded?
[1192.63] -Mall.
-Park.
[1196.18] Think clearly, was it mall or park?
[1202.71] First we went to the park and then...
[1205.51] No, no, first we went to the mall
[1209.04] and then we went to the park, and outside
the park there was an exhibition,
[1211.91] so we thought of taking a look at it.
[1214.95] Okay, fine, so what was in it 
to hide from me?
[1219.45] Actually... there was a problem.
[1226.37] There was a board outside the mall
[1229.25] that it is not allowed to take
unnecessary stuff inside.
[1237.15] -Wasn't it funny?
-No, you aren't funny at all.
[1240.63] Seriously you just eat up our brains.
We can't take you along everywhere.
[1246.19] I am not so keen either
to go with you guys everywhere.
[1249.47] It's just that I was wondering why
you guys aren't attending my calls.
[1252.16] Sorry, Daddy.
[1256.54] Listen, Zaid, could you
drop me home please?
[1260.69] Wow, you have to do all the things
in the world alone and now...
[1266.31] now you are even going on dates alone.
[1268.28] Where I went, it is called
a meeting not a date.
[1272.88] Right? I am not like you
to go on dates secretly.
[1276.31] And besides I went 
with my mom's permission.
[1281.37] Zoya, don't touch me on the raw, please.
[1288.63] Anyway, tell me, how was the boy?
[1291.55] -Mind blowing.
-Oh, details?
[1294.96] Drop me home, I'll give
you all the details.
[1300.68] Hey, look at her, madam.
[1305.51] Which new province is she planning to form?
[1307.89] What? Were you guys talking about me?
[1312.45] No, no we were just thinking
that because we were laughing,
[1315.03] your imaginary pilaf might not get burnt.
[1316.82] So, please carry on, I'll just go 
and provide her my driving services.
[1319.87] -Shall we go, ma'am? 
-Yes, let's go driver,
[1321.92] pick this bag please. and follow me, okay?
[1325.94] Okay, bye, Aima. Driver! Bag.
[1342.02] I wanted to meet you alone, and you
came with a whole procession there.
[1347.28] Listen mister, that is not your problem.
[1350.86] Yes, it is your problem,
 but things will be done my way.
[1354.73] If you want hat you pictures reach
you safely, then come and get them.
[1359.90] Why did I become unwanted
[1364.39] No one knows that
[1368.93] Why did I become unwanted
[1373.71] No one knows that
[1394.34] What happened?
[1396.41] I have had this with this
mother and daughter.
[1400.05] Come on, Mama, find some new people 
to fight with.
[1403.32] I am fed up of looking at old fights.
[1406.30] I have scolded Shabana
so much today,
[1408.98] she will keep her mouth
shut for months now.
[1411.59] What?
[1413.27] They have become very clever
they have complained to your dad about us.
[1418.55] -Us, means mine too?
-Yes,
[1422.13]  They are becoming braver day by day.
[1426.60] Mama, I think Aima has done it,
because auntie isn't that brave.
[1432.32] -For now I took care of Shabana.
-You did good,
[1435.70] but these people won't give up so easily.
[1438.94] If they won't then they will keep
listening to my scolding like this.
[1442.82] Mama, play the game in such a way
 that you win from both sides.
[1446.94] What do you mean?
[1448.51] Means, scold auntie too, and stay
naive in front of dad as well.
[1453.74] -How?
-Mama, play a double game.
[1457.50] Before she goes and
complain about you to dad,
[1461.55] you just go to dad and pretend that you
have been wronged and start crying.
[1465.54] I did the same the other day.
[1468.61] I made Aima cry, and then in front of dad
I pretended that Aima hates me.
[1475.20] Oh, Nosheen, you are something.
[1478.56] I am something special, I swear.
[1480.63] You have taken after Shabana for sure.
[1483.71] I have already told you 
that I am your duplicate.
[1487.21] No, niece and aunt belong 
to the same family.
[1490.32] It can be, because I also know how 
to get things done by shedding false tears.
[1496.05] -See?
-But auntie doesn't misbehave.
[1499.43] And when it comes to misbehaving, 
I have taken after you completely.
[1503.13] Shame less girl, you are calling
your mother ill mannered?
[1506.67] -Your heaven is under my feet.
-That's what I am giving regard.
[1511.96] By the way, what have you thought
about the proposals you are getting?
[1516.13] We'll see when they come.
[1517.72] Don't do anything stupid this time, okay?
[1520.88] Winking, peeking, no need
for all that this time.
[1524.38] Why, Mama? it's so much
fun scaring boys away.
[1528.58] If your dad sees it, he is going 
to break your legs first and then mine.
[1532.90] That would be great, this way at least
I will stop getting any proposals.
[1561.11] You are a very cheap man.
[1564.28] You wasted my time.
[1567.26] Aren't you ashamed even a little bit?
You called me and didn't show up yourself?
[1572.44] If you are so brave then you
should have come and talked to me.
[1576.87] I wanted to meet you alone, 
and you came with a procession.
[1581.96] Listen, mister, this isn't your problem.
[1585.56] Yes it is your problem, 
but things will be done my way.
[1588.99] If you want that your
pictures reach you safely
[1593.72] then come and get
them, that too alone.
[1596.49] And listen, come alone this time.
[1599.98] And don't tell anyone at
home where you are going.
[1605.17] I am not coming to meet
you now, understood?
[1610.60] Fine, you will be responsible
of you infamy then.
[1613.74] Your pictures instead of reaching you
will either go over the Internet,
[1617.97] or they will reach any
family member of yours.
[1621.27] I hope you won't do any mistake this time.
[1624.76] I am going to text you
the time and location. Bye.
[1664.84] What are you both up to?
[1667.21] What's wrong, Zaid?
[1668.68] You both are acting like
weird secret agents.
[1670.39] You guys go out without
even telling anything.
[1672.42] I don't get at all what you are saying.
[1674.90] Who has gone out and where?
[1676.56] -Aima is with you right now, isn't she?
-No, I'm at home.
[1681.90] Are you joking?
[1683.41] I really don't know where Aima is.
[1685.36] Why don't you ask auntie Shabana, 
she might have told her before leaving.
[1689.53] She just told auntie that
she is going with a friend.
[1692.46] and she has no friend other than you.
[1696.37] -I am really worried about her.
-Worried, what for?
[1699.63] She has been acting so weirdly
since past few days, you know,
[1702.09] she goes to the university by herself. Keeps
strolling at night on the roof top alone.
[1706.46] And she went with you too the other
day, and she didn't even tell me.
[1710.28] Something is going on between you
both that you are hiding from me.
[1714.10] Just chill, no need to worry, she might
have gone somewhere but she'll be back.
[1718.65] And you know she went so secretly
 that nobody knew about it.
[1723.10] Zaid, she might have gone somewhere.
[1724.71] I mean why do you start choking
when she goes somewhere?
[1728.44] Because she never goes without telling me.
[1734.15] Besides, I needed a suggestion
from her, regarding Kinza's gift.
[1738.71] By the way, why are you giving
so many gifts to Kinza?
[1742.46] Did she just got back after pilgrimage?
[1744.32] She will go for pilgrimage with me only.
[1747.92] Zaid, you have actually
gone blind in her love.
[1751.06] Not blind, I have actually
started seeing the world now.
[1754.67] Oh, come on, drama queen.
[1756.99] -Anyway, listen, are you free right now?
-Yes, had to do a few things.
[1761.29] Just put those thing on hold, I am
coming to pick you up, get ready.
[1764.11] Where are we going?
[1765.96] I have to get a gift for Kinza.
[1767.96] Now that Aima isn't here, you can
come with me as her replacement.
[1770.74] Replacement? I want to be 
the first priority of everyone, okay?
[1776.51] You know, these tantrums of yours, they are
the real cause that you are still single.
[1782.83] Okay, Miss first priority, get ready, 
I'm coming to pick you.
[1785.59] Okay, bye.
[1865.39] Faisal, you are a genius. 
You planned it out so well.
[1870.23] Aima's pictures seem so suspicious.
[1872.63] Whoever is going to see it, they will
get a clear picture of the whole story,
[1876.95] that this girl has gone to meet a guy,
and she is very comfortable about it.
[1881.67] Thank you so much, man. 
You have made me really happy.
[1884.72] You ask me something and I
don't do it, is it possible?
[1889.81] No need to be a hero now,
[1892.17] it is you that has made my life hell.
[1894.66] Neither we would have gone to that cursed
party, nor my dad would have caught me.
[1899.61] What's done is done.
[1901.27] Just do one thing now, 
arrange the money as soon as possible.
[1906.47] Because the guy I have hired to
this work is very professional.
[1910.13] So I can't any kind of risk.
[1912.78] And what if Aima had brought your
brother along, then what?
[1914.73] Yes, he has taken the risk, 
and has done a good job too.
[1918.60] Don't worry about his payment, I am going
to transfer as much as he asks for.
[1922.62] Wow, this means Azmat enterprises
is doing good business.
[1926.97] Behave. Dad has done just one
good thing in his life.
[1932.51] -What's that.
-His business.
[1935.56] Listen, would your dad throw 
this poor girl out on this thing?
[1939.32] Why? What do you care?
[1941.21] Still, I mean we trapped her.
[1945.41] What's your problem with it then?
[1947.83] At least I should have an idea
what punishment she may get.
[1951.02] No need to be on her side, there are
already too many people doing that.
[1954.73] I am confined to this
home for so long,
[1956.72] you have never worried
about me so much, Faisal.
[1959.01] Look, listen to me,
[1960.38] if you want to fight with
me then I am hanging up.
[1962.93] Okay, you know what the
next step will be, right?
[1966.10] Just make a final edit and do this
thing for me quickly, please.
[1970.40] -Okay boss.
-It's going to be so much fun.
[1974.74] Okay, listen, I think someone is
coming, so I gotta go now, bye.
[2012.33] Say here whatever you want to say, 
I am not going to come inside.
[2016.23] We can't talk here. Come inside.
[2019.31] I have told you, talk here, 
I'm not going to go inside.
[2021.79] People are going to listen here, I can't
talk here try to understand, please come in.
[2027.09] Come.
[2032.02] Come in, come.
[2043.56]  Why did I become unwanted
[2048.14] Nobody knows that.
[2052.64]  Why did I become unwanted
[2057.43] Nobody knows that.
[2062.87] I love you, Aima.
[2066.03] You cheap man, if you
contact me ever again,
[2069.45] then I swear I am going 
to involve the police, understood?
[2072.62] When I told you not to discuss it,
 why did you do it then?
[2076.44] -Discuss what?
-The one with Auntie and Nosheen.
[2088.75] What happened?
[2091.47] Dad, are you okay?
[2094.04] Dad? Aima, get some water.
[2097.66] -I think, are you getting a heart attack?
-Dad?
