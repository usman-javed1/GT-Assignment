[0.13] From flowers and from buds
[4.57] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.16] When I saw you
[19.02] Okay, if you want should I
tell you about a proposal?
[23.44] Yes, sister, sure.
[26.15] My distant relatives, they are
looking for a girl for their son.
[31.60] They asked about Nosheen
[34.17] but their son is a little old for Nosheen.
[39.31] So I thought I should ask you.
[41.62] After all Aima belongs to our house too.
[44.88] Meet him once.
[47.17] If you like him, then with God's
will your marriage can be fixed.
[51.93] All right?
[56.43] -Mother.
-Yes?
[62.32] Say yes to auntie on my behalf.
[77.92] -Okay, then tell me.
-What?
[81.39] Anything about yourself.
[84.04] What should I tell you about myself?
[87.47] What you know about yourself.
[92.06] What's wrong?
[94.44] -Don't you know anything about yourself?
-It's not like that.
[98.50] I was just thinking what one
should tell on such instances.
[104.60] Okay, let me help you out.
[107.43] Look, first of all you need to relax, okay?
[110.44] It's just a friendly talk.
It's not a formal interview, okay?
[116.95] And look, I'm not telling
you about myself right now
[119.79] because we have limited
time, and my story is very long.
[123.84] So, I'm going to tell that
to you when we have time.
[126.75] Okay, so what do you want to know about me?
[131.81] I just want to know what your
routine is? Who your friends are?
[137.80] Likes, dislikes, just all this.
[140.90] I get up at 5:00 in the morning. I pray.
[144.39] Then I prepare for breakfast with mother
and then have breakfast with everyone.
[149.66] And then I go to office.
[151.90] Oh, wait, wait. Come on.
[156.40] I'm not asking you to provide
me details from morning till night.
[162.25] Okay, tell me about your social circle.
[167.47] I don't have any a social circle as such.
[171.16] Don't tell me, Aima. You know
I've got a long list of friends.
[175.70] And at times I feel like
I breathe just because of them.
[179.44] Really? My friends are just Zaid and Zoya.
[185.09] -Zaid?
-Yeah, my cousin.
[188.12] Oh, that's good. He's a nice chap.
[191.57] And it's nice that your friend is at home.
You don't have to go anywhere to meet him.
[195.69] Yeah, that's true.
We go to meet Zoya at times.
[200.14] Or she visits us at times.
[203.29] And we three are always together in the
university and have a lot of fun together.
[209.34] Good. But now that you are going to get
married, Zaid is going to miss you a lot.
[216.89] No, it won't happen.
[220.27] Why? Doesn't one misses his friends?
[223.93] -When I'll leave then Zoya will come here.
-Meaning?
[228.62] Because they both are getting married.
[232.16] Oh, with each other?
[235.86] -Wow, that's great.
-They're lucky.
[239.03] Okay let's do one thing. Why don't you be
friends with me? You'll be lucky too then.
[244.05] How?
[245.66] Because then you'll get
married to your friend.
[250.49] Yeah, that's a nice idea.
[253.58] Well it's done then, we are
friends from now on, okay?
[258.26] By the way our families
have given us plenty of time.
[262.07] So, I'm thinking to tell you
something about myself too.
[265.08] -Yeah, sure.
-They're calling you inside.
[271.68] -I told you.
-We'll be right there.
[275.26] -Okay, you go, I'll just  make a call and come.
-Yeah, okay.
[294.55] Aima, hasn't Faiq come with you?
[297.07] Auntie he is talking
to someone, brother Fai...
[299.69] Dear, don't do this. Just forget
that you ever used to call him brother.
[304.02] Sorry, auntie, I'm just used to say it.
[307.06] It's all right, you'll get
rid of saying it gradually.
[312.67] Believe me, brother Azmat,
[314.76] since the day I have decided
to find a match for Faiq,
[316.84] this is my first and last proposal
that I have given for Aima.
[320.15] Shabana didn't take me seriously
but I never lost hope.
[330.32] Oh, so she is here finally.
[334.56] Oh, so that's why your dad
was stopping me to go for shopping.
[338.61] Actually, Shabana was interested
but I asked her to wait for a while.
[344.11] -Really?
-Actually we never wanted to send Aima so far away.
[348.92] And now it's a miracle of nature
that you have come near us yourself.
[351.90] Brother Azmat, you don't need to
worry about where we live. Near or far.
[356.83] You just need to know that
we will never fail in taking care of Aima.
[362.15] -Let's go.
-You go ahead, I'll be right there.
[373.91] -I believe in you.
-I don't know where this boy is?
[378.00] We're getting late,
we have to get back home.
[380.65] No, how can you leave like that?
Shabana has made so many arrangements.
[384.81] She has made lunch especially for you.
[387.34] She has been busy since morning.
Please you must eat with us.
[390.11] Brother, there was no
need of this formality.
[392.97] I just told her that we'll
leave after meeting.
[395.57] But now that Shabana has
made so much arrangements,
[397.87] it doesn't seem appropriate to say no.
[404.89] -Oh, shi**
-Excuse me.
[407.76] Sorry, sorry, I'm really sorry.
[410.08] Let me just clean it up.
[412.96] I hope I didn't burn your hand.
[417.30] -Excuse me?
-Yes?
[420.55] -I asked you something.
-What?
[423.41] Does it burn on your hand?
[425.91] It is, a little.
[428.62] I hope it doesn't leave a scar.
[431.36] We'll get to know later
how deep the scar is.
[435.53] By the way, I came to ask who you
are and what are you doing in my home?
[441.65] I'm really sorry. I came here
considering it Aima's house.
[445.11] I didn't know that you
live here as well.
[446.86] Or else I would have taken
permission from you.
[449.26] No, it's okay.
[451.01] By the way, I'm Faiq. I'm a guest here.
[455.03] I'm Nosheen, and this is my house.
[459.51] I'm really sorry, I thought
my auntie lives here.
[464.30] She lives with us.
[467.53] Okay, good.
[470.24] By the way are you just here to meet your
auntie or is there any other reason too?
[476.51] You're very smart.
[478.82] Actually I've come here to meet Aima.
[483.69] But you have met me too.
[487.80] Yeah, that's true, but I've come
to meet Aima for a specific reason.
[493.29] -I think you must have gotten me.
-Yeah, of course.
[498.87] What's wrong?
[500.78] Nothing, it's just that
I'm a little surprised.
[504.56] Surprised? What for?
[506.63] You seem quite decent apparently.
[510.30] Anyways are you going to keep
talking to me or will you come inside too?
[516.81] It's your house, we're
here in your house.
[518.48] How can we enter it
without your permission?
[521.84] -May I?
-Yeah, sure.
[530.56] Shabana should have come sit with us now.
[535.01] She went to make tea right after lunch.
[538.96] Shabana is like that since
the beginning. So hospitable.
[542.00] She never sits down with
anyone for a minute even.
[544.39] Yes, true.
[545.95] Anyways, how long has
it been since you're back?
[548.84] It's been few days since Faiq got back,
[550.98] I went to Canada to Asim.
I just got back from there.
[553.96] All right.
[555.13] Believe me, this is the
first house that I'm visiting.
[559.09] You could have come
later after relaxing a bit.
[562.55] I am relaxed by seeing Aima.
[569.83] To tell you the truth, brother Azmat,
[572.21] this was my long held desire that
Aima becomes my daughter in law.
[577.41] God didn't give a long life to my brother.
[580.59] But Shabana has raised Aima so well
that my brother would be at peace up there.
[586.41] That's true, Shabana has raised Aima
as well as she could.
[592.54] With God's grace, brother Azmat,
[593.95] her personality is like
this since the beginning.
[598.92] She has been so considerate,
wise and humble since childhood.
[609.19] She is like a diamond. Whichever
house she goes, she'll turn it to heaven.
[614.09] It's just that God has given you the vision
which can recognize a diamond like Aima.
[620.55] Otherwise not everyone has this
kind of a vision to recognize gems.
[626.23] Brother, Azmat, I'm asking Aima's hand
in marriage for my son Faiq from you.
[630.23] And I'm completely sure that you
are going to fulfill my long held desire.
[634.77] But before that,
I want to have Aima's consent.
[638.52] Don't worry, sister. If everything works
out God is going to make everything better.
[642.89] With God's will.
[644.56] And, brother Azmat if you want to make
any inquiries about Faiq please go ahead,
[649.81]  it's your right.
[651.84] Faiq has grown up in front of us.
[655.84] That's true, brother Azmat but still
you can satisfy yourself completely.
[660.91] Until now we are pretty satisfied, and with
God's will it is going to remain that way.
[665.07] With God's will.
[677.68] So, what's up?
[681.82] Nothing much.
[683.09] No, no. Something is going on,
I saw you how you were smiling.
[689.80] When was I smiling?
[692.77] I'm not talking about right now.
[694.60] I'm talking about the time you
were with your special someone.
[698.33] I was observing you
what a broad smile you had then.
[703.60] It's amazing that you met him
for the first time and so much understanding.
[709.21] So what? He is nice.
[711.75] Okay, okay, fine.
Means are you going to do that now?
[715.84] Okay, listen, how did you like him?
[720.95] If you like him then it's fine.
[724.67] No, Zaid, I'm asking about your opinion.
[728.09] -Actually, Aima.
-Tell me what it is?
[735.01] I hope you won't mind.
[741.06] Just forget it. Besides,
my opinion doesn't matter that much
[744.00]  that it could change anything.
[746.56] Zaid you know how much
your opinion matters to me.
[753.16] I might change my decision
because of your opinion.
[761.60] Okay then if I say
that I didn't like him at all
[763.82]  and I don't think he is right for you
[766.19] So are you going to say no to this proposal?
[770.19] Listen Aima, I'm sorry.
[772.90] I just didn't know how to tell you that.
You were so happy with him.
[778.09] So didn't you like Faiq?
[781.27] Should I say no
to mother for this proposal?
[786.39] Okay, I'll say no to mother.
[789.76] Oh you crazy girl, I was just joking.
[794.85] How can you reject someone
on the basis that I don't like him.
[799.08] I mean, come on, it's supposed
to be your choice, be confident.
[805.23] Look, Aima, this decision is supposed to
be yours only nobody else's, not even mine.
[813.20] Because ultimately you have
to spend your life with him.
[817.79] In fact if you like a guy
and the whole world is against him
[821.60] I'm going to fight the whole world
but get you married to that guy.
[824.95] Why? Why would you have done so much for me?
[828.49] What do you mean why? Because I love you.
[833.47] You're my best friend.
[835.02] So, how do you like Faiq?
[838.32] He is nice, a very nice guy.
[840.86] I mean, well settled, well educated.
[843.22] Small family, great personality what else
do you want. You have directly hit a six-er.
[848.94] Excuse me, he is my cousin.
[851.18] There you go, another plus point.
You have got a ready made package.
[857.84] Trust me, Aima,
you are going to be very happy.
[861.05] Even more happy than me and Zoya.
[865.97] Just pray for me.
[877.41] So what have you decided?
[881.55] The family is really good. If Aima
finalizes I would fix the marriage soon.
[888.62] Fine. She wasn't getting any proposals from
outsiders, so within family is better.
[895.04] What do you mean?
[896.78] I mean didn't you see how
that lady was praising her niece?
[905.43] I mean, okay everybody has some qualities.
[910.76] But why did she need to praise her so much?
[914.14] Nimra wasn't praising
her to please someone,
[917.09] in fact she was telling her
what she thought of her.
[920.88] One gets to know after
marriage about the reality.
[925.62] She knows her since childhood.
[927.96] And she is well aware
of Shabana's nature too.
[930.58] She is not stupid that she
will wait for Shabana's response.
[935.45] She knows her, that's why she said that.
[939.05] That's why I'm saying,
what did she see in Aima.
[942.75] She is just an ordinary kind of a girl.
Did you see their boy, how handsome he is?
[947.38] He is rich too.
[949.63] Was she the only girl they could find.
[951.30] If you want to pick out faults
in everything then go ahead.
[957.72] But I only wanted yours
and your sister's benefit.
[964.62] Look, when a proposal comes,
a lot of things seem nice
[968.51] and a lot of them are shown as nice.
[970.34] But in reality it isn't like that.
[975.66] Just keep your eyes open before saying yes.
[978.87] My eyes are open.
[980.85] I know the world much more than you do.
[982.73] I know how to deal with the world, so
please keep your suggestions to yourself.
[987.20] Whenever I say something
I become the bad person.
[990.95] I wish you would have
realized Aima's value.
[994.25] That's enough, Mr. Azmat.
Don't say anything more.
[998.81] Now I know why you are in such
a bad mood for so many days.
[1002.96] Because Zaid preferred
my niece over your niece.
[1010.02] Listen to me carefully.
[1012.34] Even if Zaid had chosen Aima then I
wouldn't have let this marriage happen.
[1018.95] I wouldn't have let my son's fate ruin.
[1027.00] I don't know, I think she
can't chew her food properly
[1030.38] that's why she chews
her words so much.
[1034.60] Time will tell whose fate is going to
shine and whose if going to get ruined.
[1041.47] Sorry, I'm really sorry.
Let me just wipe it.
[1047.56] I hope I didn't burn your hand.
[1051.78] -Excuse me?
-Yes?
[1054.81] I asked you something.
[1071.08] By the way, I came to ask who you
are and what are you doing in my home?
[1077.19] I'm really sorry. I came here
considering it Aima's house.
[1080.65] I didn't know that you
live here as well.
[1090.38] This Aima has such good
fate, she has won a lottery.
[1108.03] Aima, what are you doing?
[1111.97] I was waiting for you.
[1116.57] Are you satisfied?
[1118.94] Yeah.
[1121.72] I can see it on your face.
[1124.68] Look, dear,
[1127.51] I want you to forget old things.
[1131.18] Just forget that you 
had any feelings for Zaid.
[1136.66] Mother, I've already moved on.
[1141.41] Didn't I tell you that whatever
God does, it's better for us.
[1146.40] We often lose hope even after knowing that.
[1151.11] I have never lost hope with God.
[1154.10] Even I didn't lose hope.
[1157.20] But there was a sorrow 
which was eating me from inside.
[1166.03] That my daughter couldn't get 
what she wanted.
[1173.22] But, dear, today I understood
[1176.96] that God's will and wisdom
[1181.92] can never be understood by us 
with our insignificant minds.
[1188.88] And I have also understood
[1193.69] that if you and Zaid had gotten together
[1197.78] then sister would have always been 
an obstruction between you two.
[1201.60] She would have never 
let you both stay happy.
[1204.41] You're right, I had an idea about that.
[1208.82] No you see, Aima, 
God has been so merciful to us.
[1214.11] I was so happy to see that sister Nimra
was showing so much love towards you.
[1222.22] I can't tell you.
[1223.98] And I was also happy to know
[1227.44] that there is someone who loves
you as much as me and brother do.
[1233.67] He is such a wise boy.
[1236.18] Mother, are you sure that I
am going to be happy there?
[1241.08] Dear, why not?
[1244.86] If they are taking you 
so willingly with so much honor,
[1249.28] then they are going to keep
you very happy too, with God's will
[1253.72] And I am the happiest about the fact that
brother is satisfied with this proposal.
[1260.77] Aima, now just your approval is required.
[1265.84] Mother, I had already said yes to you.
[1270.89] No dear that wasn't your approval.
[1275.23] that wasn't your agreement.
[1278.90] That was your anger 
with your situation and your fate.
[1287.90] You just said yes to 
be saved from your sorrows.
[1294.69] To escape from you situation.
[1298.05] That's why I didn't consider
that approval of yours as a yes.
[1303.06] -Mother, I...
-Dear, the decisions one takes emotionally
[1306.99] are usually regretted by him later on.
[1310.54] Always remember, whenever
you are grieved just be patient.
[1316.83] Don't take any decisions emotionally.
[1321.83] Either they are emotions 
of happiness or sorrow.
[1326.10] Yes, Mother, you are right.
[1329.92] So I want to ask you once again
[1334.56] that do you accept this proposal?
[1339.00] Yes I accept.
[1344.50] Now I can actually see
your acceptance in your yes.
[1348.53] Now just let me discuss
something with brother,
[1353.26] then I'll say yes to sister Nimra.
[1358.74] Are you happy?
[1363.65] Aima, I'm really happy.
[1368.34] So happy that you have 
no idea about my happiness.
[1404.88] -Hello.
-Hi, how are you?
[1408.43] I'm good. You tell me, how is auntie doing?
[1411.64] She is absolutely fine.
[1413.56] Okay, listen what are you doing right now?
[1415.72] Me? Nothing special, just little chores.
[1420.60] Oh, this means I was just hoping
in vain that you must be missing me.
[1428.60] I was thinking that we should
have dinner together tonight.
[1433.99] What is it? Say something.
[1436.94] No don't say that, what should I say.
[1440.50] Seriously I was about to say that.
[1444.18] I knew it. Okay, tell me what's your plan?
[1447.13] -Okay, I have dinner.
-That's amazing.
[1451.72] Then let's have dinner together.
[1453.79] that would be really great, 
I'll make something nice for you.
[1457.84] No, not at all.
[1460.47] It will be a romantic dinner. 
No family member.
[1464.02] Only you and me.
[1468.12] Oh, that. Let's me ask mother then.
[1473.65] I knew you'd say that. That's why 
I have already asked auntie.
[1477.66] And she has no objection 
on us going together.
[1479.86] -Okay, but...
-No ifs and buts.
[1483.09] Just get ready, I'm coming at eight.
[1485.89] Faiq, there is so less time till eight.
[1489.09] Actually I wanted to see how
much time you take to get ready.
[1492.83] I'm doing post marriage preparations.
[1495.00] And be ready till eight, okay?
[1497.85] And what if I take longer than eight?
[1501.02] Then I'll wait a little longer for you.
[1502.98] Okay, I'll get ready quickly. Bye.
[1530.20] What's up, Nosheen? Everything all right?
[1532.92] Oh, no. Life has become so difficult.
[1537.38] Just stay confined in this house.
[1541.80] Neither anyone talks to me, 
nor involves me in anything.
[1549.43] They have removed me from everything.
[1551.99] Dad doesn't even look at me.
[1555.52] And Zaid, even he doesn't talk to me.
[1558.52] Now you tell me what should I do?
[1561.03] Just have a little patience, 
everything is going to be fine.
[1564.50] No, it's been already so much time. 
Nothing is going to be fine.
[1573.84] I'm fed up of all this.
[1578.19] By the way are you free?
[1585.06] Did you want anything from me?
[1587.92] No I was just thinking 
why don't we go out somewhere?
[1594.08] -Where?
-Anywhere. Like a mall or to the movies?
[1599.35] I just want to go out.
[1602.69] Actually,
[1606.08] Nosheen, it isn't possible today. I'm
a little busy. I've to go out for dinner.
[1613.00] Where? Can I come with you?
[1617.06] No, actually I'm going 
for dinner with Faiq, so...
[1625.79] Okay, it won't be appropriate
for me to come along, right?
[1635.04] Yeah.
[1637.90] Okay, have fun. I'll look for
something to do in the house.
[1666.74] This one's nice.
[1695.80] Oh, once again, how are you?
[1699.32] I'm good, what a pleasant surprise.
[1701.65] What are you doing here?
[1704.52] There is a lady who lives here and I
have a plan to have dinner with her.
[1707.25] You tell me, are you coming 
from somewhere or going somewhere?
[1710.23] Neither I'm coming from anywhere, 
nor I'm going anywhere.
[1714.46] Wow, means you stay so
dressed up even at home?
[1718.07] Yeah, I like it.
[1721.09] That's nice. One
should stay dressed up.
[1723.29] One may have to go
out anywhere at any time.
[1726.32] Actually I had a plan to go with a friend,
but she ditched me at the last moment.
[1732.73] That's really sad. So what 
about this preparation now?
[1736.43] I don't know, I might change.
I wish I could go somewhere.
[1741.41] By the way, if you want you can join us.
[1745.17] Oh, really? But wouldn't Aima mind?
[1748.70] Well, I don't know, she shouldn't mind.
[1752.78] -That's great, then I'll come along.
-Sure.
[1766.74] Really? She has proved 
to be a hidden warrior.
[1770.73] Let her get back, 
I'll take all reports from her.
[1773.60] As soon as he marriage got fixed, 
she forgot her oldest friend.
[1777.89] Dear, how can she forget you?
[1781.11] You are her best friend.
[1784.16] Forget it, auntie. If that was the case 
she would have told me for sure.
[1788.22] She is going out on dinner with her would
be husband and I don't even know about it?
[1792.11] She didn't even know it herself.
[1797.37] She got to know at the last
moment when Faiq called her.
[1800.76] She got ready in a hurry and left.
[1804.53] Other wise she would have
never hidden it from you.
[1806.63] Okay I'll agree because you say so, 
but it doesn't looks like that to me.
[1810.93] I'm sure she must have planned it
earlier. I'll ask her when she returns.
[1816.04] Okay, she'll be back in a while.
You can ask her whatever you want.
[1820.87] Complain to her as much as you like.
[1826.68] By the way, should I say something?
[1829.55] Okay, first tell me
[1834.48] since when did you start
taking permission to talk to me?
[1839.51] I am really happy to see you so content.
[1843.08] Faiq is a nice guy and he
is going to keep Aima happy.
[1846.19] With God's will.
[1848.61] I just wish that may God keep them
really happy. May he gives them good fate.
[1854.44] -Amen.
-Amen.
[1859.05] Have you guys seen Nosheen?
[1861.69] Nosheen? Isn't she home?
[1864.84] I didn't see her since evening.
I thought she might be in her room.
[1870.70] But now I have looked for her in
the whole house but I can't find her.
[1874.84] So I thought of asking you both.
[1878.86] Call her and ask.
[1880.81] Why don't you call her. 
I can't find my phone right now.
[1894.29] Hello, Nosheen, where are you?
[1898.66] Dinner? With whom?
[1904.34] All right, okay.
[1908.19] What happened? Where is she?
[1912.23] She is with Faiq and Aima.
[1923.13] Have you asked your sister in law
what she wants for dowry?
[1928.44] Sister, I don't find it
appropriate asking her this.
[1935.97] Look, I'm just saying that in your favor.
[1938.30] This way you'll know if they want any dowry
or not. And if they do what do they want?
[1945.07] Why did you take Nosheen along? This
was supposed to be your special moment.
[1950.34] And you involved Nosheen in it?
[1953.69] You're so stupid.
[1955.63] I'm busy right now.
[1958.06] -What do you think?
-What the hell?
[1959.38] That if we don't remind you that
doesn't mean that we all have forgotten.
[1963.16] Are you going to do whatever you want?
[1965.71] Have you forgotten what you have done?
[1967.75] Who the hell are you to forgive me?
