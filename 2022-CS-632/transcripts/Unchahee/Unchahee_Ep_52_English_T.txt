[0.00] From flowers and from buds
[4.57] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.16] When I saw you
[14.31] I learned to chirp from you
[18.91] Bye.
[20.97] Yes, what is it?
[22.87] Faiq, how is Mr. Azmat doing?
[26.33] I don't know, mother.
[27.58] Faiq, why don't you know?
[32.67] Didn't you call Nosheen or Zaid?
[35.58] Hello.
[39.42] Hello, who is this?
[41.89] Hello, who are you?
[44.22] You called, who do you want to talk to?
[47.65] Dad!
[55.92] Dad, how are you doing now?
[62.74] Dad, I got really worried
after knowing about your health.
[78.06] Nosheen, how is your dad doing now?
[81.19] Auntie, he is doing better now.
[83.89] Thank God.
[88.23] Tell me when he returns
home. I'll go see him then.
[104.70] Nosheen, everything all right?
[108.62] Excuse me, what were you saying?
[111.19] I was asking when your
dad is getting back home?
[115.49] Don't know, may be
today or may be tomorrow.
[119.40] Okay fine, tell me when he returns
home. I'll go see him.
[128.30] Nosheen, is everything all right?
[131.96] Yes, auntie,wrong numbers asking you
to buy this and that, it's just one of them.
[137.82] If you want to go home or
meet your dad then you may go.
[143.95] Besides you are needed
more at your home right now.
[147.08] To hell with you.
[149.41] Nosheen?
[151.24] Oh, I wasn't talking to you.
[153.70] Actually I'm not feeling to good
today. I have a little headache too.
[159.01] So I'll go tomorrow to my mother's.
[162.00] Or when dad gets back I'll see then.
[165.48] By the way, I'm really worried about dad.
[170.78] Yeah, okay, fine.
[204.72] You must be tired. You're
at the hospital since 3 days.
[209.99] No, I'm fine.
[212.47] No you're not. Look at yourself.
[215.94] You have got dark
circles under your eyes
[218.01] and you haven't even
eating anything properly.
[220.08] Just tell me the timings of dad's
medicines. I'll take care of him.
[226.74] Thank you, Zoya, really means a lot.
[231.12] You shouldn't be saying this.
We're a family, Zaid.
[235.47] Don't worry, Dad has recovered at
the hospital and then got back home.
[240.39] No, Zoya,
[242.86] Dad has had a severe attack this time.
[246.64] We will have to take extra care of him now.
[249.30] WE are here for him. Auntie, me and you.
[253.36] He'll be okay.
[263.45] Listen, I saw a couch online.
[268.69] And it goes well with
the scheme of our lounge.
[272.01] I hope you'll like it.
[274.23] Wait, I had it's picture,
where did it go? Here it is.
[278.55] And look at this rocking
chair. Isn't it nice?
[283.07] After dad gets better,
then after a week weâ€™ll...
[287.87] Zoya!
[290.60] I can't shift right now.
[293.90] I'm not asking you to shift right
now, we'll shift when dad gets better.
[299.25] You didn't get me.
[301.51] What I am trying to say is
that for now I can not shift .
[307.27] What do you mean for now?
[310.90] Dad is not well at all and
I can't leave him like that.
[346.31] Really? What cruelty is she facing here?
[350.92] She isn't facing any cruelty here.
She does what she wants.
[355.47] But my be she feels bad by seeing Aima
here. May be that's why she is leaving.
[360.75] So? It's such a big house, there
are so many people living here,
[364.57] is she going to take away Zaid from
all of us because of just one person?
[368.39] That's what I am sad about.
[370.06] How are we going to meet
him? Zaid will get distant from us.
[374.04] Mama, why do you seem so helpless?
[379.91] You should have raised hell.
Stop Zaid from going.
[384.30] But what can I do now, Nosheen?
[386.70] You can set auntie and
her daughter straight.
[390.03] Besides, all of this is done by
auntie. She is the mastermind behind it.
[395.07] Nosheen, if you dad hasn't
stopped Zaid, what can I do then?
[399.73] If dad isn't saying anything
then at least you should stop him.
[402.22] He is Zaid's father. How can I stop him?
[406.44] You are the lady of this house,
it's not a joke.
[409.74] Nosheen, no need to pump me up.
I know my stature and place very well.
[416.74] I have lost that stature
because of your deeds.
[420.68] All you need is two minutes
to blame everything on me.
[424.94] Yeah, don't make me
repeat old things. Okay?
[428.35] You always leave the real culprit
and end up on me and my mistakes.
[432.56] It's not always Aima and
Shabana's conspiracy.
[437.46] -I'm not even talking about them in this case.
-Then?
[440.51] It's strange that you have
always feared Aima and her mom
[445.27] and your own sister and
niece have bitten you.
[449.38] Your own blood has proven to be so sharp.
[452.12] Aima is better than Zoya,
[454.42] at least she would have
stayed under this roof with Zaid.
[458.11] Don't know when we'll get to meet him now.
[460.76] Why are you saying this, Nosheen?
Zaid has promised that he will be visiting.
[464.32] It doesn't matter what he has promised.
[465.92] Now only that will happen
what auntie and Zoya wants.
[470.93] What kind of life is this?
One son was taken away by a girl,
[475.04] and the other is being taken
away by your own niece.
[481.50] Did you raise your son to see this day?
[485.09] Nosheen, no need to incite
me, it is of no use. All right?
[490.67] There is one thing, mama. This
world is a recompense of deeds.
[494.04] You spent all your life in distancing
dad and auntie from each other,
[498.13] and see, your own relations
are distanced with you now.
[523.90] How are you feeling?
[526.81] I feel a little anxious.
Having cold sweats too.
[532.16] Look, Nosheen, keep yourself busy in
chores so that your body stays active.
[536.64] This won't happen then.
[542.05] Tell me, are you going to
go to your mom's tomorrow?
[545.44] No, why?
[546.92] Actually I have invited a
friend tomorrow,
[549.22] so I would like you to stay home
and help mom in the kitchen.
[553.76] Who is this friend and
why is he coming home?
[559.08] You should have taken
him to your restaurant.
[561.72] What are you talking about? I felt like
inviting my friend to my home so I did it.
[566.33] Anyway, which friend?
[569.92] I have invited Sania.
[572.19] What?
[574.86] The same Sania whom you were taking
selfies with, getting too close to her?
[578.06] You talk such nonsense, Nosheen.
[580.08] For now, tell me who told
you to invite her home?
[584.52] Look, Nosheen, this is my home.
[587.25] And I can invite whoever
I want, whenever I want.
[589.97] And I am not asking
you, I am telling you
[591.92] that you have to be
home tomorrow, that's it.
[594.37] What do you want, Faiq?
[596.51] That I should meet this girl
smiling, I should serve her,
[602.29] who I am afraid of might take
my husband away from me?
[605.60] That's why I have invited her that you
meet her and clear your misunderstanding.
[611.79] When you'll meet her you'll know
that she is such a nice and decent girl.
[616.22] Well, one is supposed
to be scared of nice girls.
[620.80] No guy like bad girls.
[623.27] It's useless to argue with you, 
please leave me alone.
[627.75] Rather make a cup of tea for me.
[644.81] He thinks I'm his servant.
[647.65] Iron my clothes,
[649.97] make me tea.
[651.49] Can't see his wife's condition,
and then he invites that witch too.
[656.01] Let her come, I'll show her then.
[662.37] Nosheen! What's wrong? Are you okay?
[666.13] Yes.
[668.72] What's wrong? Are you feeling okay?
[670.54] No, aunty, I'm not feeling
well since morning.
[674.87] I'm feeling dizzy and seems
like I have got fever too.
[678.70] Okay, you go get some rest. 
I'll make tea for Faiq.
[683.34] Okay, then I'll take some medicine.
[685.55] No, don't take any medicine right now.
[686.94] I'll take you to the doctor in the morning,
you can take your medicine after that. Go.
[711.24] Dad, are you feeling any better?
[716.77] I'm a little better.
[718.71] You had to bother so
much because of me.
[723.11] What are you saying, dad? 
We didn't do any favor to you.
[729.05] In fact, as much as you have done
for us, it is nothin compared to that.
[733.46] Who had called him?
[737.42] You were admitted in the hospital
and your condition was serious too.
[742.59] So? What difference does it make?
[746.03] Actually, Dad, I thought that brother
Hammad is the elder son of this house and
[750.88] he should be aware of it.
[753.64] Otherwise he would have felt bad
if he came to know about it later.
[756.76] What are you saying?
Which house? Whose son?
[763.43] what does he have to do with the
problems and tensions of this house?
[768.15] He has left this house, Zaid.
[773.00] Why would he care if we live or die?
[776.24] It's not like that, Dad, he...
[779.08] he cares about you.
[780.85] I had to call him.
[786.08] And then you guys came.
[788.85] Mom, called him on
my wedding too,
[791.28] and forced him a lot, but
he didn't show up then.
[794.26] Well,
[796.24] you can have an idea by it that doesn't
want to keep any connection with us.
[802.34] And you guys are calling him again
and again and forcing him to come.
[805.85] No, Dad, I never pressurized
him, I just told him about your health.
[810.05] He came to meet you himself.
[814.03] He thought that I might
be leaving this world.
[819.02] So, he should come and ask for
forgiveness using this excuse.
[821.76] Otherwise he will be questioned by God.
[824.17] It's not like that, Dad, you are being
negative about him for no reason
[828.04] I should be even more negative for him.
[833.59] You shall be thankful that I didn't
ask him to leave then and there.
[838.93] Did I say anything about him to you?
[842.39] Then why are you doing it now?
[844.81] Because I feel that he is
ashamed on what he has done.
[847.51] That's why he was
asking for your forgiveness.
[849.30] Look, Zaid, he has already left the
house, and you are about to leave.
[856.29] I don't want my kids to do
anything because of my fear.
[860.78] Everybody has a right
to live with their own will,
[862.99] and I have understood this fact now.
[868.46] And I have prepared
myself mentally as well
[872.98] that I don't anyone any more now.
[876.73] Dad, I know one thing for sure,
[878.93] you may not need us but me and
brother Hammad will always need you.
[888.14] Please.
[921.12] Zaid, are these your documents?
[924.39] What documents?
[926.24] Your original educational documents.
[930.87] Why have you come to
give me these at this hour?
[933.26] I thought you might need them.
[937.29] You know that I often misplace my
documents, that's why I keep them with you.
[941.65] I'll take them from you when I need them.
[943.78] I think you should give them
to Zoya, she'll keep them safely.
[953.08] Okay, I'll leave now.
[956.93] Wait, Aima.
[959.30] Sit here.
[965.18] Keep them with you
because I am not moving out.
[971.63] Really? When will you do it then?
[975.15] I don't know, but not right now.
[981.94] Or may be...
[984.01] never.
[990.17] What happened?
[992.33] What? Nothing.
[996.08] Have you thought it out
before taking this decision.
[1003.27] I mean, have you talked to Zoya...
[1006.21] Yes, I've talked to
her, in fact I've told her.
[1010.33] I feel that my family needs
me and I need my family more.
[1015.76] That's why keep these documents with you.
[1042.16] Dad, are you up?
[1045.87] Well, what waking up, dear.
[1049.83] I sleep and then wake up to sleep again.
[1056.87] That's how it is.
[1058.94] That's good then, you should take rest.
[1064.64] Tell me, how are you feeling now?
[1070.58] How should I feel?
[1073.02] I can't move around, I can't do
anything and I lay like this all day long.
[1079.91] So, it's just like that.
[1082.78] Dad, why are you being so pessimistic?
[1089.40] You have taught us that a person
shall stay happy be it any situation.
[1096.50] Then why are you losing hope?
[1099.36] I think a person gets
disappointed after a point.
[1105.56] And this point only arrives when
we don't share our things with God.
[1110.53] Why don't you share your problems with God?
[1116.49] You'll see, everything
is going to be better.
[1120.01] He is the master of miracles.
[1124.83] And it's not a big deal for
Him to make us feel better.
[1129.79] But only when us humans trust Him.
[1139.19] May be you're right.
[1143.53] My belief should have
been strong at this instance.
[1148.63] But I have gone sad.
[1151.50] But what's the cause of this sadness?
[1153.91] Everything is getting okay now.
[1158.49] What's getting okay?
[1160.60] Did you talk to Zaid?
[1163.82] He was here a while ago, but then he left.
[1168.29] Okay, means Zaid hasn't told you anything.
[1174.76] You know, Zaid isn't moving out.
[1180.56] Is it true?
[1181.89] See, dad, isn't their
relief along with problems.
[1185.09] Now just stop worrying and rest.
[1190.62] What are you thinking? Aren't you happy?
[1196.14] I am happy but
[1199.13] I'm thinking why he has done it?
[1203.37] May be he didn't think
that leaving is the right thing.
[1206.88] Is he doing it because of me?
[1210.44] Whatever the reason may be,
the best thing is that he isn't leaving.
[1217.40] And no one had pressurized him to take this
decision. He is staying by his own will.
[1225.09] And now please don't think
about it too much and take stress.
[1232.04] Did Zaid tell you that?
[1235.50] Yes, I thought he must have told you.
[1240.14] He came, maybe to tell me this but
[1245.29] the conversation
went in some other direction
[1248.05] and I got a little angry with him.
[1250.02] Why?
[1251.88] Aima,
[1255.49] I have a complain from you.
[1257.86] About what, Dad?
[1261.12] You called Hammad to the hospital, why?
[1265.52] We just told him about your
condition. He came there by himself.
[1271.06] What's the use of such an off spring
[1274.17] who meets you after so many years,
[1276.48] and that too only when the father
is hanging between life and death?
[1282.33] He met me after so many years.
[1285.31] After seeing him it didn't feel like
my son is standing in front of me.
[1293.26] I could see just a person
[1296.96] whom I have seen after many years.
[1300.06] Who used to be so dear to me.
[1307.07] And now I don't
know how he is doing.
[1310.76] How many kids does he have?
[1312.82] How do they look like, how
old they are, I know nothing.
[1316.24] Neither I asked him, nor he told me.
[1320.23] He just came like strangers,
stood for a while and then left.
[1331.30] Don't worry, brother Hammad
is going to return for sure.
[1335.97] It doesn't make any difference
to me if he is here or not.
[1341.42] There won't be any change
in my life with his absence.
[1348.18] Please don't worry and take rest.
I'll get something to eat for you.
[1353.16] Thank you.
[1355.41] Thank you, dear.
[1360.06] Oh, God,
[1363.11] give me patience.
[1379.01] Auntie, I have made a chart of dad's
medicines and placed it on the side table.
[1384.56] I can give him his medicines too but I have
to go to office so please manage today.
[1390.08] You did such a nice
thing, otherwise
[1391.80] I got really worried by
looking at these medicines.
[1395.17] Don't worry, you won't have a
problem if you follow the chart.
[1399.69] I don't want to have
these bitter medicines.
[1402.48] Whole taste of my mouth is spoiled.
[1404.55] Look at his tantrums. God has
blessed you by giving you life.
[1409.07] Try to make him understand.
[1410.57] Dad, auntie is absolutely right.
[1414.89] When you'll get better then you
won't have to take these medicines.
[1417.68] But till then you will have to compromise.
[1420.55] I want to go to office.
[1422.36] You will go for sure, but for now take
your medicines on time then you can go.
[1426.21] -I'm tired of these medicines and time table.
-Greetings.
[1429.60] -Greetings.
-How are you all doing?
[1432.68] -We're good.
-Wow, you at this time? Didn't you go to office?
[1437.68] Actually, the news was as
such that I had to come here.
[1448.93] Brother Azmat, how are you doing now?
[1452.08] I'm good. You tell me, are you okay? 
What brought you here?
[1455.90] To make you feel even better I
wanted to tell you a good news.
[1460.30] Good news?
[1463.20] Prepare yourself to run around.
[1469.21] Sister, brother Azmat,
[1472.17] you both are going to become grand parents.
[1483.79] Yes, my Zoya is expecting.
[1489.79] Wow, such great news!
[1492.76] Mr. Azmat you are going to
have a guest at your home.
[1496.59] Yes, brother Azmat. The one to carry
on your lineage is going to be here soon.
[1505.14] I'm so happy, you took
away all our tension.
[1510.84] Now you shall take good care of yourself.
[1513.36] Why should she take care of herself?
Aren't you all here to take care of her?
[1523.83] Sure, why would you take
care of yourself, what are we for?
[1532.71] Just take rest and stay happy.
[1536.41] Please have some sweet.
[1539.50] Where are you going, sit down. It's
such a big news at least have some sweet.
[1543.69] Actually I remember I
had to do something, so...
[1547.73] Congratulations, auntie.
[1551.83] Come on, Zoya,
[1565.94] If you have got the news
then it must be good.
[1569.98] No, but I want to here it from you.
[1573.57] Yes Zaid, I'm, I'm expecting.
[1577.30] Really? Thank you so much!
[1580.07] Faiq has told me a lot about you too.
[1582.87] Really? Like what?
[1584.56] Like about your marriage
[1587.50] and the toxic relationship
between you and your husband.
[1593.54] I felt really bad about knowing it.
[1595.49] Well, it's good now, because
you have another option now.
[1600.27] You can trap anyone you like.
[1602.01] Faiq, pick up your phone!
[1609.25] What does the report say?
[1614.06] Oh!
