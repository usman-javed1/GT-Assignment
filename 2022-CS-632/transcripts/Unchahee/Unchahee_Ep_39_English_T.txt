[0.00] From flowers and from buds
[4.54] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.13] When I saw you
[14.07] I learned how to chirp from you
[18.83] I swear, never again.
[21.36] I will never take any
decision that hurts you.
[25.23] Nor will I let anybody
make such a decision.
[29.22] It's a promise and I won't let it break.
[32.97] He got very upset when Zoya left.
[36.25] He was like that for everyone.
[40.50] Now that she is back,
he will accept you too.
[43.89] Not only as a friend,
but as a wife as well.
[47.87] You should have been to
your in laws on your way back then.
[51.48] - Why?
- Because your wife has gone there.
[59.02] Do you actually want that
we become sisters again?
[62.80] - Yeah, Amber, of course.
- It's possible on one condition only
[68.72] that you remove Aima from Zoya's way.
[79.87] Where did my journey had to stop
[91.36] Where did life take a turn
[94.76] Forget him
[106.16] Just remember what you have got
[201.23] Hi, how are you?
[203.63] -Where were you?
-I went to my mom's where else?
[207.90] -So, you didn't bother to even tell me?
-I did call you, Faiq.
[211.80] You didn't call me at all, Nosheen.
[214.19] Oh, yes, I called
but it didn't get through.
[218.43] Well, one can send a message too.
There are many other ways to contact.
[223.01] What's wrong, Faiq?
[225.43] Look, Nosheen, from now on, you
won't go anywhere without asking me.
[231.79] You will go only if you have my
or mom's permission otherwise not.
[238.19] I went to my Mama's,
not to meet any boyfriend.
[242.29] -What nonsense, Nosheen?
-What's so wrong in that?
[246.61] Don't you even know how to talk to someone?
[249.94] You are married now.
You should respect this relationship.
[255.43] And look, don't go like this again. It isn't
considered nice in our family to go out like this.
[260.57] I told your mother that I'm going.
[262.92] You just informed her,
you didn't take permission from her.
[266.61] Well, do I need to get her signatures on
a permission letter even to visit my mom's place?
[270.12] Yes, exactly, that's how it's going to be.
[272.09] If you are not allowed then
you won't go anywhere, that's it.
[277.30] By the way, what was the
emergency that you had to go there?
[281.70] Actually, Zoya is back,
so I went to meet her.
[285.52] What do you have to do with her?
[287.65] Didn't you say it yourself that it doesn't make
any difference to you with someone else's life.
[292.85] It's something concerning my house.
[295.67] Look, Nosheen, this is your house now
[300.31] so it's better that you take interest
in issues concerning this house.
[305.40] What's wrong, Faiq,
why are you getting so furious?
[308.96] I asked you something and
you didn't even pay any heed to it.
[314.70] One question after another,
am I in a court room?
[318.22] What did I tell you? That you should
help mom, do chores in the kitchen,
[322.06]  have you been in there yet?
[324.53] I went there, Faiq, but your mother got
angry and asked me to get out from there.
[330.13] You're lying. You are
falsely accusing my mom.
[333.90] Faiq, why are you talking to me like that.
Nobody has ever talked to me like that.
[338.84] For sure your mother has poisoned you
against me in my absence, she is too cunning.
[342.86] Shut up, Nosheen, stop this nonsense.
[347.81] Look, I can't here a single word
against my mother.
[353.56] And the most important
person in my life is my mother.
[359.72] If you want me to stay happy
then you'll have to keep her happy.
[363.87] This way neither my tone
will change nor my mood.
[371.99] Is he out of his mind?
What does he think of himself?
[376.19] I will have to set him straight.
[378.02] How dare he get angry at me.
[398.39] How did your dinner go last night?
[401.37] It was okay, in fact it was nice.
[408.25] When are you joining office then?
[413.34] I think you should join soon.
[416.95] I'm going to join as soon as
the situation gets better here at home.
[421.94] -Aima is joining office from tomorrow.
-Okay.
[426.27] If she is starting work, this means
that everything is normal at home.
[430.85] I think you too shouldn't
delay joining the office.
[435.94] Okay, I'll just have to take care of
a couple of things and then I'll join.
[441.80] I'd like you to come to office
with Aima like you guys used to.
[446.34] Dad, I was thinking what if
Zoya joins office with me too.
[451.90] You know how official matters are,
you have to look after a lot of things.
[460.03] It's better that Zoya
spends some time at home.
[462.27] As soon as there is a place
according to her qualification in office
[465.83] I'll let her join.
[468.85] Okay, Dad, I'll go now.
[471.91] Zaid, sit, I have to talk to you
about something important.
[475.98] Sit down.
[479.09] If you have anything to talk about
other than Aima, then please...
[482.19] What do you mean by that?
[485.05] Zaid I have been noticing that you are
ignoring everything related to that girl.
[492.27] I have told you this
a lot of times before too.
[495.21] But I don't see that you are
giving importance to what I say.
[500.29] Zaid, if you have taken the responsibility
then you will have to fulfill it as well.
[504.48] It's important, you will be
answerable for that as a husband.
[509.71] God may let go of his rights
[511.27] but he will not forgive if one
doesn't give people their due rights.
[516.57] Aima is your wife give her, her due rights.
[520.04] You have to give her her rights
either you want to or not.
[525.79] If Aima stays quiet that doesn't mean
[527.97] that you treat her as you like and nobody
is going to question you about it too.
[533.45] I can't see injustice being
done to anyone in my house.
[538.37] Half of my life is spend
advising my wife and daughter
[541.45] to be fair to my sister and niece.
[543.79] And I don't want that rest of my
life is spent in lecturing you about it.
[547.57] And I hope we don't have
to talk about this topic again.
[593.21] Zaid, you here, at this hour?
[598.03] What is it? Everything all right?
[601.29] Have I done anything wrong?
[606.44] Sit down.
[615.25] Look, Aima,
[617.95] We are bound in this relationship
due to a compulsion.
[623.45] Maybe it was in our fate.
[626.86] But whatever has
happened wasn't good.
[634.96] To both of us.
[639.89] And ironically
[644.56] everyone has got expectations from me.
[647.42] Now you tell me how can
I keep everyone happy?
[650.17] Zaid, you don't need
to keep anyone happy.
[654.58] Just keep Zoya happy.
[658.26] I wanted that too.
[660.57] But it isn't possible in this situation.
[666.04] Why isn't it possible, Zaid?
[671.57] This is dad's house and
we go by his principles here.
[678.71] Nobody can go against him.
[683.02] Anyway, I have come here to
tell you that I'm not angry with you.
[689.23] I just got so worried in this situation
that I was running away from reality.
[698.99] Maybe that's why
I misbehaved with you too.
[704.84] Aima, I never meant to hurt you
[709.69] I, in fact I am surprised at
myself why I treated you like that?
[718.98] I... please forgive me.
[723.73] That's not needed, I can understand
what position you are in right now.
[728.57] But the truth is that
you are my wife and...
[735.82] I'm your husband.
[741.24] And there are some duties and
right attached to this relationship but
[745.74] I'm afraid I won't be able
to fulfill them for now.
[753.61] But trust me, Aima, I will
try my best to keep you happy.
[758.94] I don't want anything from you, Zaid.
[764.22] I am not expecting
anything from you either.
[768.52] But...
[771.79] -I have got a request.
-Sure, go ahead.
[775.77] Don't distance yourself from me.
[782.09] I am going to stay like your friend
as we were before.
[785.70] I will never ask anything from you.
[788.74] But please, don't divorce me.
[844.24] I know what you are going through.
[850.75] But believe me, my child, it was necessary
for me to take that decision that time.
[857.55] This is what was required.
[862.18] Aima...
[864.55] -Aima, everyone is blaming me.
-I haven't committed any sin either, Dad.
[869.48] But I am being judged too.
[871.48] If you get angry with me too,
where am I going to go?
[875.20] It's you only who understands me.
[879.33] Who can share my sorrows.
[882.31] Aima dear, please don't be angry with me.
[884.93] I'm not angry with you.
[887.93] -But...
-Don't be sad, my child.
[890.75] I took this decision for my
sister's life and your happiness.
[894.61] My happiness? What happiness, Dad?
[898.44] Do you think I can ever
be happy in my life again?
[901.02] Why are you getting so depressed, Aima?
[905.42] Time is the greatest healer. Give
this relationship a little time at least.
[909.42] I'm sure the situation isn't
going to remain the same always.
[912.38] Things will get better
with the passage of time.
[924.68] Whatever happened, neither I
am responsible for it nor my sister.
[927.98] Is there any shame in you or not?
[930.40] What are you saying, Amber?
[935.27] Why? What do you want now?
[937.66] Should I still respect
this shameless person?
[939.82] Hey you, behave yourself!
[943.85] You are standing in my house
and talking to me in this tone.
[946.62] Don't you know what I can do to you?
[948.55] Try to threaten someone else.
[951.09] Neither am I going to
get scared of your threats,
[953.56] nor am I going to care
about any relationship now.
[957.01] Fine, do whatever you can!
[959.98] You'll see now what
I am going to do with you.
[962.42] I am going to take such a revenge of all the
injustice that have been done to my daughter
[966.24] that you are going to
remember it all your life.
[978.38] Yeah, Zoya, tell me how are you doing?
[981.84] -Mom, I'm fine, absolutely fine.
-Great.
[986.45] You know we went out for dinner last night.
[988.72] The same place where he had proposed me.
[993.58] So, did she go along with you two?
[996.36] No, Mom, what did she had to do there.
[999.99] Well, I can't say anything
about the rules in your house.
[1004.10] No, Mom, just don't worry.
[1006.53] It was my condition for
returning in Zaid's life
[1009.18] that Aima's presence
wouldn't matter to him.
[1014.32] And Aima has understood very clearly.
[1017.93] It's just uncle who creates
hurdles in everything.
[1020.96] But, Zoya, listen to me carefully.
[1025.18] Look, you don't have any
written agreement with Aima.
[1030.08] And you shouldn't forget that she
has got all the support in that house.
[1033.66] In fact even Zaid listens to her a lot too.
[1037.39] So, you know it
[1040.00] your father in law has got a crooked mind,
[1042.97] and if she has his support
Aima won't take long to change.
[1046.73] Yes, Mom, you're right.
[1048.88] That's why, as soon as you can
get rid of this girl, get her divorced.
[1055.53] Mom, it can't be done so soon.
I'll need a little time.
[1060.50] Make life hell for Zaid
until he leaves her.
[1063.87] Mom, I'm waiting for the
right time and right moment.
[1068.80] Okay, listen, I am
sending tickets for you both.
[1073.71] -Tickets?
-Yeah, tickets, for you honeymoon.
[1077.02] Really, Mom? I'm so excited.
[1080.12] My child, you guys have been through
such a big phase in the past few days.
[1084.09] It's time to relax.
[1085.75] Thank you, Mom. You're the best mom ever.
[1089.95] Anyway, tell me where are the tickets for?
[1092.08] That's a surprise.
You can see when you get them.
[1095.88] Really, Mom? I'm so excited.
[1100.10] Just stay happy.
[1101.81] -Bye.
-Okay, my love, good bye.
[1195.70] Hello, Zoya,
[1199.11] Yeah, he is sleeping here.
[1203.08] All right, I'll wake him up.
[1214.28] Zaid.
[1216.90] Zaid.
[1223.81] Zaid.
[1226.04] Zoya has been calling you for so long.
[1229.79] I didn't know now I slept here.
[1233.89] -When did she call?
-She called a while ago.
[1237.42] She has been calling you for long.
[1240.41] If you were up you should
have woken me up too.
[1243.27] I thought I shouldn't
disturb you while sleeping.
[1247.05] And by the way,
[1250.45] I'm hoping that you
won't tell dad anything.
[1255.12] Yeah okay, whatever you want
is going to happen.
[1262.63] Thank you.
[1289.12] Zoya, tell me why are you angry?
I told you before I went there.
[1294.43] Just listen to me, what's wrong?
[1297.18] When did you tell me that
you'll be back? 5:00 am.
[1300.95] -Yeah I did but...
-But what, Zaid?
[1305.32] I went to sleep, I'm sorry.
[1309.83] -It's not a big issue.
-Not a big issue?
[1312.98] Zaid, if you consider yourself in my place,
[1315.91] you would know how it
feels to wait for someone.
[1320.41] Look, Zoya, I'm sorry but
I didn't break any promise.
[1324.06] Besides, I would need to go there
after every few days, you know it well.
[1328.05] So what are you expecting from me?
[1330.23] Just that we don't fight over
this topic over and over again.
[1334.31] I'm not fighting with you, Zaid.
[1336.12] Yeah I know, but still your mood is off.
[1339.13] I don't even want that. I just want
you to accept this relationship happily.
[1344.07] Yeah, I know, and gradually you are going
to make me agree to everything you want.
[1347.43] And one day you are going to say that uncle
wants to see mine and Aima's children.
[1351.22] Please, Zoya, you'll have to trust me.
[1353.89] The promise I had made
to you, I have kept it.
[1357.95] And I can't do it without your support.
[1360.33] You have no idea
that I wasn't able to sleep all night.
[1364.24] -Why?
-What do you mean, why?
[1368.25] My husband was with
someone else all night and I...
[1370.81] Relax, Zoya, I love you.
You're my whole world.
[1375.77] Do you love me that much?
[1377.75] Do you doubt me? Try me if you want.
[1380.68] Let the time come.
[1406.41] What the hell, man.
[1430.21] It's a mess here.
[1433.81] Who is going to clean all
this mess, where is the duster?
[1448.56] Who will clean all this mess?
[1451.59] If the old woman sees her
kitchen in this condition then...
[1454.68] It's nice, I will be saved
from coming in here.
[1468.99] -Hello, Mama.
-Hello, Nosheen.
[1472.68] -Mama, I'm in a very bad shape right now.
-What happened?
[1476.01] Has anyone said something to you? Tell me.
[1479.09] Faiq's mom was telling
me that Faiq likes
[1481.60] semolina sweet, chick pea curry
and flour flat-bread a lot.
[1485.77] My God, why are you crying
on that, can't you make it?
[1489.68] That's what I'm doing.
[1492.33] -Then why are you crying?
-I don't know how to make this stupid food.
[1496.35] What's to worry about it? Just
go in the internet and search for it.
[1500.67] It would have been great if the way you are
advising me, it could be made as easily too.
[1505.50] All brides use the internet and
cook, I don't know what's your issue.
[1509.51] Please come here and cook
for me, I am not able to do all this.
[1514.27] Nosheen you are absolutely lack any skill.
[1516.71] Don't give me suggestions but
a solution that what I should do.
[1520.30] The kitchen is a mess right now
and if that old woman sees then...
[1523.24] Nosheen, talk slowly,
someone might hear you.
[1525.55] It's good that she hears, at least
she won't let me in her kitchen then.
[1529.09] If she hears this,
[1531.21] then not only in her kitchen, 
she won't even let you in her house.
[1533.98] Honestly, Mama, I am in
bad state in just a few days.
[1538.06] That mother and son
have so many issues
[1539.54] that they don't even
want to hire a servant.
[1541.81] Okay, now enough of this drama.
[1543.32] You were dying to marry him, no bear it.
[1547.58] Look, Nosheen, you will have to get settled
there, you don't have any other option.
[1551.48] Did you just call to taunt me?
[1554.36] Mother's cook food and
send to their daughters' house
[1557.53] so that they are respected in
their in laws, and here you are...
[1559.82] Listen to me, why don't you ask your mother
in law. She will tell you how to make it.
[1567.30] I don't know what you want, Nosheen.
[1569.46] Didn't you have any
lamer suggestion to give?
[1574.62] Even you are scolding me.
Forget it, I will find a solution myself.
[1578.76] Every one scolds me all the
time. I don't want to talk to you, bye.
[1595.91] Oh, God, Nosheen! What
have you done to my kitchen?
[1615.81] Oh wow, these are tickets to Europe, wow!
[1621.20] Yeah, they both were so
stressed in the past few days
[1625.98] I thought they will get
fresh if they go out for a trip.
[1629.77] But, Amber, aren't two days very
less to get prepared for traveling?
[1634.13] What preparations? They just have to get
ready a bag each and go sit in the plane.
[1639.25] I have made arrangements of all
the reservations and pick and drop.
[1644.47] That's an amazing surprise.
[1647.93] My daughter deserves it too.
[1650.90] May God save our children from evil eyes.
[1653.48] Tell me, do you want to have
tea or should I get lunch served?
[1657.34] I'll have tea.
[1682.81] -Greetings, Mom.
-Greetings.
[1686.01] How are you doing and how was your day.
[1689.77] Don't ask please.
[1692.24] I don't get it, what's wrong?
[1694.01] I have spent all day in
cleaning my messed up kitchen.
[1697.41] But who messed up the kitchen?
[1699.73] Why don't you ask this to your wife?
[1705.62] -Did Nosheen go to the kitchen today?
-She has got zero skills.
[1711.90] She much more inefficient than I imagined.
[1716.25] -Mom, what is so wrong that she did?
-What can I say?
[1721.80] I wish I had taken a picture 
of the kitchen then
[1725.07] you would have had an idea then 
what she did with it.
[1731.06] She has got no idea. She knows
nothing, no sense to work at all.
[1738.46] Even a small kid won't do
what she did to the kitchen.
[1744.49] It took me a whole day to clean it.
[1747.48] But why did you clean it yourself?
[1750.37] Who should have I asked then?
[1751.96] I mean you should have asked Nosheen,
she should have cleaned it herself.
[1755.15] Just forget it, Faiq, she doesn't need to.
[1760.53] To tell you the truth, she wouldn't
have been able to clean it either.
[1766.23] Tell her, she shouldn't even cross 
from in front of my kitchen.
[1771.00] But, Mom, if she won't go to the
kitchen how is she going to learn?
[1774.66] No, she doesn't need to.
[1778.35] I can cook and feed
you both until I'm alive.
[1782.86] Mom, if he won't go, how will she
learn to cook? How is she going to learn?
[1786.92] I don't know.
[1789.10] I just don't understand,
[1790.99] why don't mothers teach their daughters how
to do things before they get them married?
[1797.01] Do you remember how much her
mother was praising the taste in her hands?
[1802.89] -I'm telling you, they both were lying.
-Okay, Mom, relax.
[1807.42] Just forget whatever happened
and please give her a chance.
[1813.29] Faiq, if she is so interested she should
go and learn it at her mother's house.
[1817.97] I am not running an academy here.
[1834.97] You are blindfolded my your mother's love.
[1839.80] And you are unable to see anything.
[1846.45] But it's okay.
[1848.23] What ever I do for you both,
I can never be good enough.
[1851.84] Listen, where is Zaid? Is he happy?
[1856.99] Of course, Mom, why wouldn't he be happy?
[1861.31] Okay, now be careful,
someone might create a drama.
[1865.62] You have been so strangely since I have
returned home. Are you in your senses?
[1869.30] What do you care? 
All you care about is your mother.
[1873.18] Mind your language, got it?
[1875.22] This is how I talk.
