From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned to chirp from you Is everything all right? Yeah, everything is fine. He must be busy with his business. I'm sure he'll call me when he is free. Don't you have any manners?
Why are you checking my phone? Why is Faiq sending you messages? Mind your own business. Nosheen I'm your elder brother,
I have the right to know. Aima, I think you
are hiding something from me. Why would I hide anything from you? I have noticed that you have been
very disturbed through out the wedding. And I didn't find it normal. What's wrong with you? Nothing. Zaid, look at her eyes. Mom, how are you feeling? Dear, I feel great. It seems as if
a long awaited wish is fulfilled today. Thank God I have
completed my responsibility today. I... I really feel wonderful today, wonderful. Aima, dear, I am so happy today, Why do you seem sad then? No, not at all. And don't you ever get sad too. And I'm sure even if you get sad then Faiq won't let you stay sad for long. Shabana, you're here and I've
been looking for you for so long. -Yes, brother?
-Your guests are here. Yeah, I was just coming outside. Aima, dear, are you ready? Yes, Dad. We have to take you out now,
the cleric is here. Come. My child, she is looking so pretty. May God save you from evil eyes. Zaid, did you check up on the catering guy?
I hope everything is fine. Yeah, Dad, I talked to him,
everything is perfect. Just make sure nobody has any
problem, it's a matter of our reputation. Relax, Dad, calm down.
I am in touch with everyone. Okay, fine. -Where is Faiq?
-I think he has gone to attend an urgent call. Oh, okay. Mr. Azmat please call the groom so that
we can start the solemnizing the marriage. Sure, I'll just call him. Please go and see, tell him the cleric is calling him. What's going on here? What's wrong? Is his
cell phone switched off? No, it's ringing but he isn't picking up. It's been quite some time,
please call the groom now. Please wait for a while, I have sent Zaid.
Yeah, so? Dad, I have looked for him
everywhere but I couldn't find Faiq. Couldn't find him? What do you mean? I don't think he is here. You all have to come with me. What do you mean come with you? The marriage
ceremony is about to take place here. I'm telling you all to come with me. Come with me. Zoya, what's going on?
Where has everyone gone? I don't know, they have gone inside. I think auntie needs to talk to
them about something important. Okay, just don't worry. It must be
something, I don't know about it right now. Zoya, I'm really anxious about Faiq. I'm very worried. He must be here somewhere, just
don't worry. Your make up will spoil. How an I not worry, Zoya? Whatever it is, is related to my marriage. Just call Zaid and ask what is wrong. Call him, quickly. How can everyone leave like that? Dial once more. He is disconnecting. Zoya, the way auntie has called
everyone, I think it's bad news. And I'm worried about
mom, she is so weak-hearted. -I'm really worried.
-Calm down, why are you thinking so negatively? Everything is going to be fine. -Please call Zaid.
-Yeah, I'm calling. Relax, relax. Faiq, tell everyone what the truth is. Don't look at her, look at me and answer. Tell me honestly,
what have you done to her? Please, let me talk to him. Faiq, tell right now in front of
everyone what is it all about? Tell them Faiq how much you love me. Tell them that you used to come
and meet me by ignoring Aima. Tell them that we have met
privately at your place and at my place. What nonsense is she saying?
Tell us honestly. He is not as innocent as much
he seems. Tell what the truth is. Zaid, back off. Faiq, say that all of it is a lie. The reality won't change even
if he says it, auntie. He was... Shut up! Just shut up. I know who is telling
the truth here and who is lying. Don't you dare utter a single word anymore. Sister Nimra, I'm sorry. I know what the reality is and all this
drama has been created by my daughter. I'm well aware of her nature. Faiq has no fault. What are you saying? Shut up, if you say
a single word then I'm going to... Zaid isn't picking up my phone. Everyone is looking
at me with strange eyes, Zoya. More than half of the guests
have left already. Aima, I don't understand what's going on. Why don't you ask auntie? Go, ask her. Mama, doesn't know herself what's going on. Everybody is waiting for the marriage
ceremony outside, we're getting late. What kind of a father are you? Aren't you ashamed to accuse
your daughter in front of everyone? I am ashamed, but not on me
but on this daughter of yours. You know her reality very well too.
She hasn't done this for the first time. -Are you done talking or is there anything else left?
-Nosheen! Don't you have any shame? Zaid, Zaid there is no use doing all this. Don't you even think about it. Enough
of your father and son's oppression. Mama, I know why he is getting so
angry because he knows that dad is lying. He is accusing me falsely. Why don't you tell dad
whom you saw me with? Who sent me messages on my phone? I know you are lying.
Dad, is absolutely right. All this is your conspiracy. Zoya, how long are they
going to take? See how late it is. Mama, we don't know
ourselves what's going on inside. And I was calling Zaid
but he isn't answering. But what is it that they
need to discuss right now? People are saying all sorts
of things, this isn't right. Look, sister, the time
for the ceremony has passed. Please let me know what should I do? Please wait for a little while,
they'll be here any moment. Yes, please wait for a while.
I'll go and see what's wrong. I'm coming with you. Please, at least you tell the truth. Tell the truth before it's too late. I don't understand what I should say. What do you mean, Faiq?
Is this all a joke going on here? Dad, everyone is waiting outside. Now stop all this drama. Everybody come outside
for the ceremony quietly, I'm going. No one is going anywhere. I'm going to make you all hear myself. Listen to this. I accept that I like you.
But I can't get married to you. -So are you compelled to marry Aima?
-You can say that. Look, I've been under pressure
to marry Aima since long. Nosheen, I've started loving you too. I enjoy your company. If you
aren't with me I start missing you. But, I can't do it. I don't have the courage to elope with you. -Auntie, get hold of your self, auntie.
-Move away. -Shabana, Shabana.
-Go, get some water. -Shabana.
-Shabana. Come on, Shabana,
have some water and take your medicine. If you won't get well how are we
going to carry on with this wedding? Brother, how will this wedding
going to take place anyways? What are you talking about, Shabana?
This wedding is going to take place. And Faiq and Aima are going to get married. -I will talk to Faiq.
-Talk to him? What are you going to say to him now? And what Faiq has said that
we all heard, what about that? Try to understand,
this is all a game set by Nosheen. You know that she is prone to
conspire. She has trapped Faiq. And she is done all this
to belittle him in front of us. Don't you know her nature?
You know it very well. Look, please, I'm telling you, if Aima is going to get
married she will marry only Faiq. Shabana, he is absolutely right.
And I'm Faiq's mother. Who else can know
her child better than a mother. If there was something like it, Faiq
would have definitely mentioned it to me. But he didn't say anything. Shabana, trust me, Faiq likes Aima. I haven't forced him at all. Yes, I expressed my wish in front of him. But he likes Aima. And brother, with due apology, I have often noticed Nosheen
trying to get close to Faiq. There is no need to apologize. I know that it's true. See, he is saying that too. Trust me, Faiq and Aima
are going to get married today. Come on, take this pill,
take the glass, I'll talk to Faiq. And after taking your pill, come outside. There is already been a scene created. Have it. No, brother Azmat, please
go and attend the guests, I'm going to talk to Faiq. -And believe me he is not going to say no.
-Okay. I just have one request from you.
Please tell Almas and Nosheen to stop. The time to tell them to stop has passed. Had they been so intelligent they
wouldn't have done such a thing. I'm going to handle them my way. Let's go. Just get hold of yourself and
come with me downstairs. Get up. -Brother, what if Aima...
-She doesn't know about it at all. And for God's sake,
don't you even mention it in front of her. or else she would get disheartened
before the marriage. Come on. So you guys are still lying to yourself and you have unheard the truth
even after hearing it yourself? You are a liar, you and
your daughter are a liar. How else can you respond
other than cursing Nosheen. But she is telling the truth. Almas go away from here or else something might happen that
you are going to regret it all your life. Move away from here. I am not going to get
scared of your threats now. I'm not going to let anybody
be unfair to Nosheen. And Nimra, you were just
talking about asking Faiq, right? I just met him and he
has admitted it himself that he wants to marry Nosheen. Shut your mouth or else... I am not going to get
threatened by you anymore. You cannot suppress my voice now. If any one is going to get married
today that will be my daughter and Faiq. And if that doesn't happen
I am going to strangle her myself. Aima, just get hold of
yourself. Just be normal. Besides, whatever Nosheen
is saying, it's nothing like that. She doesn't fins peace
until she does something like this. Besides, what difference does it make?
She is a liar and everyone knows that. Nimra auntie has gone to talk
to your mom. So just be normal. Aima, Aima. Zaid, I didn't get married. Aima, Aima look at me. Aima, just look here. I promise I won't
let anything wrong happen with you. Do you listen? Neither Faiq can't do anything,
nor will I let Nosheen do anything. Don't worry, everything
is going to be back to normal. You have humiliated me
in front of everyone. Am I left with any respect? That girl kept telling lie
and you were just listening quietly? Tell me, was that recording real? Have you been actually
meeting her privately? Been Talking to her secretly? Tell me, Faiq, I want to
know the truth from you. That's true, Mom. I don't like Aima but Nosheen,
and I want to marry Nosheen only. And you are telling this to me now? When you have come here
with everyone to marry Aima? Faiq, you have disgraced me. I have just promised Shabana and
Azmat that my son won't let me down. You have been deceiving me. If you didn't like Aima
you should have told me. I would have said no to the proposal. At least that girl's life wouldn't
have been ruined like this. You have no idea what the consequences
of what you have done would be. Just imagine, Faiq, what Aima
must be going through right now. What's wrong, Faiq?
Why are you sitting quietly? Why aren't you responding to
the allegations by Nosheen on you? I have told mom what I had to say,
I have given my response. Say it in front of everyone. What are you going to respond. I know that Nosheen's allegations
aren't false but true. And I also know that you didn't go to
the restaurant that day for a business meeting but you went with Nosheen,
and still I kept quiet. I kept quiet because
I couldn't see Aima in pain. But I don't like Aima but Nosheen. I don't care what you want. If you have committed marriage with
Aima, then you have to marry Aima. Got it? This is not going to happen. My daughter will never go to a
place where she is unwanted. Aima won't be able to take it. If Faiq likes Nosheen, then
they both are going to get married. Try to understand this is
going to be unfair to Aima. It is very important for a boy and
girl to like each other to get married. And because Faiq like Nosheen then
Faiq and Nosheen are going to get married. I know very well what agony
you are going through right now. Or maybe I am unable to feel your pain. I am really sorry. So much that I can't
even look at you in the eye. If it were in my hands I would
never have let you get hurt like this. Believe me, Shabana. I feel so helpless. May be this is what God wanted. My daughter, my daughter must be in so much pain. She won't get married. Her marriage is going to be called off Just be patient, Shabana. Look, this is God's will,
and may be this is better for her. Her marriage is going to be called off
right before it was supposed to happen. Who is going to marry my daughter now? What if she has to pay
for this day all her life. A girl whose marriage gets called off nobody accepts her then. Nobody accepts her. I'm afraid that that even worse might
happen to my daughter. Even worse might happen to her. God forbid, Shabana, what are you saying? Look, hope for the best from God. Have patience and courage,
everything is going to be fine. Patience? Patience? Where should I get patience from? Tell me. How can I be patient? Please tell me how? I won't be able to see my daughter's pain. I won't be able to bear it. How can I have patience? How can I? How can I have patience? I won't be able to watch her pain. Oh God! How can uncle
take such a wrong decision? This is unfair with Aima.
This is wrong, Zaid. At least you should have
said something to him. Zaid, Zaid! I'm talking to you.
Do something. What can I do? I have nothing in my hands. What's happening is unfair with Aima. Uncle isn't doing right to her. What else can dad do when that
cheap person has denied to marry her. Can anyone be married by force? I can't face Aima. I don't know what to do. I had promised her. What am I going to say to her? What nonsense is going on outside? You know guys, Faiq and
Nosheen are getting married. Zoya, this is so cruel with that girl. Do you guys even know how difficult it is for the girls to get
married whose wedding is called off. Zoya, I swear that girl is going
to become a laughing-stock. People are going to say all sorts of
things and think whatever they want. Have sister and Nosheen
even thought about it for once? Zaid, uncle is calling you outside. Zoya, I could never imagine that
Nosheen could go to this extent. This girl has crossed all limits. I feel like breaking that girl's jaw. Seriously, Zoya, if I
had the slightest of idea, I would never have
married you in this family. I had no idea that this house is ruined. Mom, at least consider the situation
which is going on before you speak. You just go on and on. Listen to me carefully, Zoya, just stay away from
these mother and daughter. She may be my sister, but today I
have seen how her upbringing is. I feel so sorry. Just listen carefully, no one is going to take your
decision for you other than yourself. Even if it is brother Azmat.
I'm never going to tolerate it. You may go, I'll do it myself. -Oh, Mama, this is so beautiful.
-I got it made for your wedding. But I didn't know that you'll
get married in such a hurry. -Mama?
-Yeah, so? See how you are getting married. Mama, don't question the ways
Nosheen chose, just look at the results. Stop this drama. Hurry up, they have brought a cleric to
solemnize the marriage from somewhere,  or he might run away too. Oh, God, mama what are
you saying? I got successful in my planning
after going through so much trouble. Really? Had I not helped her then instead of your marriage
procession going out from here you would have left this house
with your funeral procession. Mama, you're so sweet. Oh, just stop it. Nosheen, tell me were you
actually going to kill yourself? Mama, may my enemies die. Oh, Nosheen, you are such a drama queen. That I am. Now, hurry up before your
daddy changes his mind. Okay, just wait a minute, let me adjust it. Come on, let's go. Mom, please have a little juice. You have just had your
breakfast since morning. Please, just have a little. Mom, why are you doing this? What's going to happen
by you being like that? Why are you getting so disturbed? You should thank God that he saved us. A person who is getting
married to someone else and has a relationship
with someone else would he be a good life partner? Tell me, Mom, am I wrong? If all this got revealed
to us after marriage then just imagine, would
I have had any option? Faiq likes Nosheen and they... Have they gotten married? I don't know, Mom. They got married or not, that
shouldn't make any difference to us. You marriage got called off? Your marriage got called off? I have accepted this reality. Please you should do so too. Get hold of yourself, Mom. Nothing is going to happen this way. Who is going to marry you? Who is going to marry you now? Tell me, tell me who is
going to marry you now? Who is going to? Mom, what will happen by doing this? Please get hold of yourself. I am losing courage too. I am about to break down. I need you. We both should support
each other in this difficult time. Please, Mom, I have
nobody else other than you. Go. Go away. Go away from here. -Mom!
-I'm going to be fine. I will be fine. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Go. Go. Go away. Go away. Go from here. Go away. Aima, as a father I want to say to you that you marry Zaid. Dad, Zoya isn't home.
She has gone somewhere. Her phone is switched off as well. I don't know where she is,
I'm going to look for her. Zaid, don't worry. I know that she must
have gotten this shock. Where is Zaid? Why aren't you saying something?
What's wrong my child? What? You have ruined
everything Azmat, everything. You have destroyed our happiness. This, what we have done. We have hurt
everyone just for the sake of our happiness.
