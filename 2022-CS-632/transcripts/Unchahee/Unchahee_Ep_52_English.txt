From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned to chirp from you Bye. Yes, what is it? Faiq, how is Mr. Azmat doing? I don't know, mother. Faiq, why don't you know? Didn't you call Nosheen or Zaid? Hello. Hello, who is this? Hello, who are you? You called, who do you want to talk to? Dad! Dad, how are you doing now? Dad, I got really worried
after knowing about your health. Nosheen, how is your dad doing now? Auntie, he is doing better now. Thank God. Tell me when he returns
home. I'll go see him then. Nosheen, everything all right? Excuse me, what were you saying? I was asking when your
dad is getting back home? Don't know, may be
today or may be tomorrow. Okay fine, tell me when he returns
home. I'll go see him. Nosheen, is everything all right? Yes, auntie,wrong numbers asking you
to buy this and that, it's just one of them. If you want to go home or
meet your dad then you may go. Besides you are needed
more at your home right now. To hell with you. Nosheen? Oh, I wasn't talking to you. Actually I'm not feeling to good
today. I have a little headache too. So I'll go tomorrow to my mother's. Or when dad gets back I'll see then. By the way, I'm really worried about dad. Yeah, okay, fine. You must be tired. You're
at the hospital since 3 days. No, I'm fine. No you're not. Look at yourself. You have got dark
circles under your eyes and you haven't even
eating anything properly. Just tell me the timings of dad's
medicines. I'll take care of him. Thank you, Zoya, really means a lot. You shouldn't be saying this.
We're a family, Zaid. Don't worry, Dad has recovered at
the hospital and then got back home. No, Zoya, Dad has had a severe attack this time. We will have to take extra care of him now. WE are here for him. Auntie, me and you. He'll be okay. Listen, I saw a couch online. And it goes well with
the scheme of our lounge. I hope you'll like it. Wait, I had it's picture,
where did it go? Here it is. And look at this rocking
chair. Isn't it nice? After dad gets better,
then after a week weâ€™ll... Zoya! I can't shift right now. I'm not asking you to shift right
now, we'll shift when dad gets better. You didn't get me. What I am trying to say is
that for now I can not shift . What do you mean for now? Dad is not well at all and
I can't leave him like that. Really? What cruelty is she facing here? She isn't facing any cruelty here.
She does what she wants. But my be she feels bad by seeing Aima
here. May be that's why she is leaving. So? It's such a big house, there
are so many people living here, is she going to take away Zaid from
all of us because of just one person? That's what I am sad about. How are we going to meet
him? Zaid will get distant from us. Mama, why do you seem so helpless? You should have raised hell.
Stop Zaid from going. But what can I do now, Nosheen? You can set auntie and
her daughter straight. Besides, all of this is done by
auntie. She is the mastermind behind it. Nosheen, if you dad hasn't
stopped Zaid, what can I do then? If dad isn't saying anything
then at least you should stop him. He is Zaid's father. How can I stop him? You are the lady of this house,
it's not a joke. Nosheen, no need to pump me up.
I know my stature and place very well. I have lost that stature
because of your deeds. All you need is two minutes
to blame everything on me. Yeah, don't make me
repeat old things. Okay? You always leave the real culprit
and end up on me and my mistakes. It's not always Aima and
Shabana's conspiracy. -I'm not even talking about them in this case.
-Then? It's strange that you have
always feared Aima and her mom and your own sister and
niece have bitten you. Your own blood has proven to be so sharp. Aima is better than Zoya, at least she would have
stayed under this roof with Zaid. Don't know when we'll get to meet him now. Why are you saying this, Nosheen?
Zaid has promised that he will be visiting. It doesn't matter what he has promised. Now only that will happen
what auntie and Zoya wants. What kind of life is this?
One son was taken away by a girl, and the other is being taken
away by your own niece. Did you raise your son to see this day? Nosheen, no need to incite
me, it is of no use. All right? There is one thing, mama. This
world is a recompense of deeds. You spent all your life in distancing
dad and auntie from each other, and see, your own relations
are distanced with you now. How are you feeling? I feel a little anxious.
Having cold sweats too. Look, Nosheen, keep yourself busy in
chores so that your body stays active. This won't happen then. Tell me, are you going to
go to your mom's tomorrow? No, why? Actually I have invited a
friend tomorrow, so I would like you to stay home
and help mom in the kitchen. Who is this friend and
why is he coming home? You should have taken
him to your restaurant. What are you talking about? I felt like
inviting my friend to my home so I did it. Anyway, which friend? I have invited Sania. What? The same Sania whom you were taking
selfies with, getting too close to her? You talk such nonsense, Nosheen. For now, tell me who told
you to invite her home? Look, Nosheen, this is my home. And I can invite whoever
I want, whenever I want. And I am not asking
you, I am telling you that you have to be
home tomorrow, that's it. What do you want, Faiq? That I should meet this girl
smiling, I should serve her, who I am afraid of might take
my husband away from me? That's why I have invited her that you
meet her and clear your misunderstanding. When you'll meet her you'll know
that she is such a nice and decent girl. Well, one is supposed
to be scared of nice girls. No guy like bad girls. It's useless to argue with you, 
please leave me alone. Rather make a cup of tea for me. He thinks I'm his servant. Iron my clothes, make me tea. Can't see his wife's condition,
and then he invites that witch too. Let her come, I'll show her then. Nosheen! What's wrong? Are you okay? Yes. What's wrong? Are you feeling okay? No, aunty, I'm not feeling
well since morning. I'm feeling dizzy and seems
like I have got fever too. Okay, you go get some rest. 
I'll make tea for Faiq. Okay, then I'll take some medicine. No, don't take any medicine right now. I'll take you to the doctor in the morning,
you can take your medicine after that. Go. Dad, are you feeling any better? I'm a little better. You had to bother so
much because of me. What are you saying, dad? 
We didn't do any favor to you. In fact, as much as you have done
for us, it is nothin compared to that. Who had called him? You were admitted in the hospital
and your condition was serious too. So? What difference does it make? Actually, Dad, I thought that brother
Hammad is the elder son of this house and he should be aware of it. Otherwise he would have felt bad
if he came to know about it later. What are you saying?
Which house? Whose son? what does he have to do with the
problems and tensions of this house? He has left this house, Zaid. Why would he care if we live or die? It's not like that, Dad, he... he cares about you. I had to call him. And then you guys came. Mom, called him on
my wedding too, and forced him a lot, but
he didn't show up then. Well, you can have an idea by it that doesn't
want to keep any connection with us. And you guys are calling him again
and again and forcing him to come. No, Dad, I never pressurized
him, I just told him about your health. He came to meet you himself. He thought that I might
be leaving this world. So, he should come and ask for
forgiveness using this excuse. Otherwise he will be questioned by God. It's not like that, Dad, you are being
negative about him for no reason I should be even more negative for him. You shall be thankful that I didn't
ask him to leave then and there. Did I say anything about him to you? Then why are you doing it now? Because I feel that he is
ashamed on what he has done. That's why he was
asking for your forgiveness. Look, Zaid, he has already left the
house, and you are about to leave. I don't want my kids to do
anything because of my fear. Everybody has a right
to live with their own will, and I have understood this fact now. And I have prepared
myself mentally as well that I don't anyone any more now. Dad, I know one thing for sure, you may not need us but me and
brother Hammad will always need you. Please. Zaid, are these your documents? What documents? Your original educational documents. Why have you come to
give me these at this hour? I thought you might need them. You know that I often misplace my
documents, that's why I keep them with you. I'll take them from you when I need them. I think you should give them
to Zoya, she'll keep them safely. Okay, I'll leave now. Wait, Aima. Sit here. Keep them with you
because I am not moving out. Really? When will you do it then? I don't know, but not right now. Or may be... never. What happened? What? Nothing. Have you thought it out
before taking this decision. I mean, have you talked to Zoya... Yes, I've talked to
her, in fact I've told her. I feel that my family needs
me and I need my family more. That's why keep these documents with you. Dad, are you up? Well, what waking up, dear. I sleep and then wake up to sleep again. That's how it is. That's good then, you should take rest. Tell me, how are you feeling now? How should I feel? I can't move around, I can't do
anything and I lay like this all day long. So, it's just like that. Dad, why are you being so pessimistic? You have taught us that a person
shall stay happy be it any situation. Then why are you losing hope? I think a person gets
disappointed after a point. And this point only arrives when
we don't share our things with God. Why don't you share your problems with God? You'll see, everything
is going to be better. He is the master of miracles. And it's not a big deal for
Him to make us feel better. But only when us humans trust Him. May be you're right. My belief should have
been strong at this instance. But I have gone sad. But what's the cause of this sadness? Everything is getting okay now. What's getting okay? Did you talk to Zaid? He was here a while ago, but then he left. Okay, means Zaid hasn't told you anything. You know, Zaid isn't moving out. Is it true? See, dad, isn't their
relief along with problems. Now just stop worrying and rest. What are you thinking? Aren't you happy? I am happy but I'm thinking why he has done it? May be he didn't think
that leaving is the right thing. Is he doing it because of me? Whatever the reason may be,
the best thing is that he isn't leaving. And no one had pressurized him to take this
decision. He is staying by his own will. And now please don't think
about it too much and take stress. Did Zaid tell you that? Yes, I thought he must have told you. He came, maybe to tell me this but the conversation
went in some other direction and I got a little angry with him. Why? Aima, I have a complain from you. About what, Dad? You called Hammad to the hospital, why? We just told him about your
condition. He came there by himself. What's the use of such an off spring who meets you after so many years, and that too only when the father
is hanging between life and death? He met me after so many years. After seeing him it didn't feel like
my son is standing in front of me. I could see just a person whom I have seen after many years. Who used to be so dear to me. And now I don't
know how he is doing. How many kids does he have? How do they look like, how
old they are, I know nothing. Neither I asked him, nor he told me. He just came like strangers,
stood for a while and then left. Don't worry, brother Hammad
is going to return for sure. It doesn't make any difference
to me if he is here or not. There won't be any change
in my life with his absence. Please don't worry and take rest.
I'll get something to eat for you. Thank you. Thank you, dear. Oh, God, give me patience. Auntie, I have made a chart of dad's
medicines and placed it on the side table. I can give him his medicines too but I have
to go to office so please manage today. You did such a nice
thing, otherwise I got really worried by
looking at these medicines. Don't worry, you won't have a
problem if you follow the chart. I don't want to have
these bitter medicines. Whole taste of my mouth is spoiled. Look at his tantrums. God has
blessed you by giving you life. Try to make him understand. Dad, auntie is absolutely right. When you'll get better then you
won't have to take these medicines. But till then you will have to compromise. I want to go to office. You will go for sure, but for now take
your medicines on time then you can go. -I'm tired of these medicines and time table.
-Greetings. -Greetings.
-How are you all doing? -We're good.
-Wow, you at this time? Didn't you go to office? Actually, the news was as
such that I had to come here. Brother Azmat, how are you doing now? I'm good. You tell me, are you okay? 
What brought you here? To make you feel even better I
wanted to tell you a good news. Good news? Prepare yourself to run around. Sister, brother Azmat, you both are going to become grand parents. Yes, my Zoya is expecting. Wow, such great news! Mr. Azmat you are going to
have a guest at your home. Yes, brother Azmat. The one to carry
on your lineage is going to be here soon. I'm so happy, you took
away all our tension. Now you shall take good care of yourself. Why should she take care of herself?
Aren't you all here to take care of her? Sure, why would you take
care of yourself, what are we for? Just take rest and stay happy. Please have some sweet. Where are you going, sit down. It's
such a big news at least have some sweet. Actually I remember I
had to do something, so... Congratulations, auntie. Come on, Zoya, If you have got the news
then it must be good. No, but I want to here it from you. Yes Zaid, I'm, I'm expecting. Really? Thank you so much! Faiq has told me a lot about you too. Really? Like what? Like about your marriage and the toxic relationship
between you and your husband. I felt really bad about knowing it. Well, it's good now, because
you have another option now. You can trap anyone you like. Faiq, pick up your phone! What does the report say? Oh!
