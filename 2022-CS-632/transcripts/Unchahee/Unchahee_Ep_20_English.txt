From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you I need to go somewhere for
some work, so I'll need your car. Can you please ask the driver? This isn't possible
because I'm going with the driver. And mama is going to work in her car. Will you talk to Azmat? About what? That he takes Nosheen back in. He never refuses what you and Aima say. Nosheen. That girl has cheated us again, Amber. What happened? Did something work out? I couldn't talk to brother. But Zaid is going to talk to brother today. Maybe he agrees. Sister, look, just don't worry. God will make everything right. Everything is going to be fine gradually. I pray to God that He rectifies
Nosheen's future. -Listen.
-Yes, sister. Aima's studies are going
to be completed soon, right? Yes, she is going to have her exams soon. What have you planned further? Aren't you worried about her marriage? Why wouldn't I worry, sister? I have wish her to get married
like every other mother does. It's her age to get married. If not now,
when are you going to get her married? You're right, sister. -I want to, but brother...
-Why? What does he say? He want that Aima should join his
company after completing her studies. So obviously, how can I
get her married then. Oh, so this is what you have planned. I have not planned anything, sister. Brother wants it. Oh, come on,
I know very well who wants what here. First, you got her a good education. And now you'll make her work with Azmat so that you become
a partner in the business. I must admit, you've conspired so well. Sister, I can't even imagine
what you are thinking of. Come one, madam.
You imagined it and made it happen too. It's all my fault
that I couldn't control my husband like other wives do, having full control. Me and my daughter suffered because
of our sharp tongues. You and Aima won the whole game by using
your sweet talk and being a yes-person. Sister, this must be a game for you. But for me, my brother is important my daughter, and the peace of this house. I know it very well that you have
gotten me and Nosheen out of your way. In fact you can say
that you have ruined Nosheen. Sister, whatever Nosheen
has done, it's her mistake. If I'm trying to bring her back then the reason behind it is
to restore the peace of this house. I'm aware of everything. There must be some hidden interest of
yours in bringing Nosheen back home. You're doing all this
to look good in front of Azmat. I know everything. -How did your audition go?
-Very well. Can anybody reject me, huh? Wow, what a pleasent surprise. I wish I had asked for something else. Don't tell me that you wish
for me in your prayers. It hasn't come to that point yet. There are a lot
of other things to pray for. You should say that you are afraid
of asking for me in your prayers. Because I'm out of your league. Zoya, how do you develop
so many vain hopes? Must be really difficult, right? Please, stop fighting both of you. We aren't fighting. Then is this called
expressing love with each other? You got it, Aima. Actually, the love between
me and Zoya is like that. Isn't it so, Zoya? I knew it. After all
you spilled out the truth. What could I do?
I couldn't wait any longer. Okay fine, if you have fallen
in love with me then I don't mind. Please, Zoya. It's time that you confess
how much you love me. Actually, you're right, Zaid. I really love you a lot. In fact, I am crazy in your love. And it's good that you confessed. You eased my difficulty. I love you, Zoya. I love you too, Zaid. I'm getting suffocated. -I can’t breathe.
-Okay, let''s end this drama right here. -I can't digest it anymore.
-I can't do it. Don't act over smart. Aima, all good? -Aima, Aima.
-Aima! What's up with her? Aima! What's wrong? Aima. Auntie. Auntie, I'm sorry. It's okay. Auntie, I'm really ashamed. I didn't imagine that I am going to
misbehave so much with you guys. I didn't imagine a lot of things either.
But they happened. Auntie, please forgive me. Auntie, I was compelled to do so. And you can see,
I have always been oppressed. Nobody has time for me in my family. Dad is always busy with office work,
mama in her own stuff. And brother Zaid,
he is with either Aima or Zoya. What are you trying to say? Just that, that I was compelled. And I had no other option , auntie. I couldn't have gotten married
to that old man. Imagine yourself in my place for once. I know, Nosheen,
you were under a lot of pressure. But some boundaries
aren't supposed to be crossed. I know, auntie, I've realized it now. If you had realized, you wouldn't have
insulted me and sister like that. Auntie, I want to change everything now. In fact, I want to change myself. I don't
want to be the same Nosheen anymore. I hope what you're saying is true. But to change things,
I am going to need your help. Look, Nosheen, I'm not going to be a part
of anything stupid with you. No aunty, just listen to me first. What do you want to say? I'm really very sorry.
Don't know what had happened to me. We don't need your sorry.
Tell us the reason. Yes, Aima, tell me honestly
why you were crying? I really have no idea what happened to me. What a stupid excuse. I mean we were having fun
and you started crying in between. Look, you can share with us. No way, she is not going to tell. She is doing it to you for the first
time, but she keeps doing this to me. Don't know what she is hiding. -Zaid I'm not hiding anything.
-Yes your are, and we can see that. Tell us. I don't know what is happening
to me these days. I start crying on petty issues. And I don't even know the reason. This is so lame, Aima. There is something for sure,
but you aren't telling. Okay, look here. -Are you in love with Zaid...
-No, no. No, no. It's nothing like that. Then? Actually I just started crying by thinking
how much we all three love each other. We three can't stay without each other but we have to be apart
from each other someday. Oh, God! I don't know where does this girl
get these ideas from? We all will remain always together. -Nothing is going to happen.
-Yes, ma'am, we're together. Now please don't start crying again. Whatever you want
to do further, it's up to you. If you want to help her then go ahead. You are right, it's a risk. I will have to get involved
in the police investigation and all. Thank God, Mom. Finally you understood
what I was trying to explain you. Why did I become unwanted? Nobody knows that. Why did I become unwanted? Nobody knows that. How long will this continue, Azmat? Let me rest, Almas. I wish God gave ma a heart like yours too. It doesn't matter to you
if I talk to you or not, our children stay in this hour or not. People find peace in looking
at their children but here... You're right. I had thought the same. That one find peace
in looking at their children. I couldn't find peace in their presence.
May be I can find some in their absence. If not yourself then
at least think about me, Azmat. Call Nosheen back for the sake
of my peace, please. Hammad's sorrow wasn't less as is. And you threw out Nosheen as well. I threw her out? Are you in your senses? I think you have no idea what
that girl has done to us. I know it. Don't embarrass me
by repeating it again and again. No, not at all. You have no idea. If you did, you would have
taught her a lesson this time. I have scolded her a lot, Azmat. She has not only ruined our honor, but she has lost
my valuable diamond sets too. If I hadn't told her where the sets are the fraudster wouldn't have
run off with them. That doesn't end here, Almas. I had opened her account. I had deposited 5 million rupees
in it as a wedding gift. What? Then? Well, that account is empty now. What sins are we being punished for? The amount of money she lost, how may poor girls
would have gotten married in that amount. What has happened to us?
We have been robbed just like that. -We're ruined.
-Nothing has happened. Thank God he has given us so much
that I am not worried about losing money. But... our daughter's character
which has been stained, I am hurt because of that. The girl for whom you are shedding tears, she has not just defrauded you she has humiliated us as well. Humiliated us. I'm not crying because of Nosheen, Azmat. I am crying because of regret. You were right at every instance,
and I was wrong every time. You even told me to be vigilant
over that girl but I made a mistake. You are right. You were right
at every instance and I was wrong. Whatever you're going to ask me
from now on I am going to accept it. Just forgive me. I like it. At least you regret your mistakes. Are you crying? I am allowing you
to bring your daughter back. Really? Have you actually forgiven her? I don't have words to thank you, Azmat. -I haven't forgiven her.
-Then? I have allowed her to come back home only. Make it clear to her as well that
she is just going to be back home, not in my heart. She can't get a place in my heart again. She just can't. Oh, God, why do these kids grow up? What favor? She was asking me
if I had some powerful connections. What for? She wants to find about that guy
who ditched her. And she ran off to elope. but the guy ran off alone,
along with all the gift money. Poor girl. Zoya, behave. Sorry, Mom. Carry on. Nosheen wanted to get 
some information about that guy. I was thinking to take her 
to meet Bisharat. -Bisharat?
-My lawyer. He is a very smart guy. He has got many links too.
I think he can help her out. Mo, please stay away from her. Don't know
what new problem she is going to create. No, she wants to change now. Really? Is she changed? You know very well what she has done. I don’t know how you can
trust her. At least I can’t. I'm doing all this 
just because of my sister. She'll be happy 
if she gets her jewelry back. Mom, in such cases 
you don't get anything back. Instead one has to pay 
even more from his own pocket. Then what? If you'll listen to me,
I'd say, do her a favor  and just send her back from this home. At least cooperate 
with me just a little bit. I can't say to my sister 
to just come and take her away. Mom, I have tried to explain you 
as much as I could. It's up to you whatever you want to do. If you want to help her then go ahead. You're right in a way. It is risky. I'll have to get involved 
in police investigation and all. Thank God, Mom. Finally you have understood
what I was trying to explain you. Actually, you're right, Zaid. I really love you a lot. In fact, I am crazy in your love. And it's good that you confessed. You eased my difficulty. I am not interested too look at you either. Tell me, that fraudster, 
did you find out anything about him? I don't know how, but I want each 
and every penny back from him. Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that Listen, I was thinking 
that Nosheen's room... The tea is really good, Aima. Zaid, do you know Mr. Jaffery? Jaffery? Are you talking 
about the one who is a trainer? Yes, the same. I met him today. I found a very old link 
to connect with him. I have talked to him regarding you. Regarding what? Just meet him 
and have a detailed discussion. Share your future plans with him. He'll guide you well. That's great, Dad. In fact I'll also
ask him something about my studies. Aima, how about your exams? Yes, Dad, going great. I have prepared all my presentations. And now just exams are remaining. They'll be over by this month. Very good. You can join the office 
soon after that. Whenever you say. It's just that 
I have reminded you about it, so that you don't join any other company. Actually what happens is that
whenever a brilliant boy or girl passes out different organizations 
pick them up right away. Dad just don't praise her so much, she
is going to ask for an exorbitant salary. I'm going to pay her as much as she wants. She is everything. And when you guys are going 
to join the company, you'll be relaxed. Who is it at this hour? -I'll just go check.
-No, sit down, Durrani will see. Durani! Just see who is here at this hour? So, Dad, What department 
will Aima join at the office? For now, you both are going 
to get some training for 3-4 months. There are different positions 
in the department wherever I'll feel that.... Greetings, Dad. Greetings, brother. Greetings. Excuse me. -Brother, I wanted to talk to you about...
-Actually, Aima, send me those printouts I have to get them printed and
submit them tomorrow morning. You must be having real fun 
with all this situation. You must be enjoying a lot. Keep enjoying, because I'm going to snatch
all this happiness away from you real soon. I feel proud that my children 
are going to help me with my business. I have a lot of expectations with Aima. This girl's future is really bright. And, look, how merciful God has been that Aima's university 
and now business are with Zaid. Commuting is not going 
to be an issue. So just don't worry. Once these kids learn about the business then I'm going to hand it over to them 
and spend a carefree retired life. Brother, That's really nice that you're hopeful about Aima's future. But I'm not satisfied. Regarding what? No matter how well Aima studies, how great her job is but one thing bothers me all the time. I know, you are referring to her marriage. Yes, brother. She is a girl and proposals for girls... Shabana, you are 
just getting worried preemptively. Just look at her age. 
There is still a lot of time. You don't have 
to worry much regarding this issue. Who knows what tomorrow holds. You know very well about my health
condition, it gets worse suddenly. I just want to fulfill my responsibility 
towards my child while I'm alive. I want my daughter 
to get married in front of me. I get really scared 
that if something happens to me then... May God give you a long life.
Why are you being so pessimistic? Life has tested me so much that now I don't expect much from life. Only thing I'm worried about 
is my daughter. You always ask other to stay optimistic 
and you yourself are being so pessimistic. Yes, brother, you're right. We should always expect the best from God. But I don't know, at times I get really depressed. And the reason behind it
is the worry about her marriage only. Nothing else. What do you think? Am I not
worried about Aima's wedding? No, brother. I don't mean to say that. I know that you are going 
to do what's best for Aima. But what can I do? After all I'm her mother. Shabana, you must have noted, that whenever
you start the topic about Aima's marriage then I avoid it. That doesn't mean at all that
I'm not worried about her marriage. In fact you can say that I have 
a good proposal for her in mind. I have a guy in my mind for her. But I'm just waiting 
for the right time and moment. I've been looking for you 
in the whole house and here you are sitting
peacefully playing games. Can't I sit peacefully in my house now? Of course, after losing all the property 
you should be at peace. Nosheen, you have given us 
a huge shock along with sorrow. That fraudster got away 
with such a huge amount of ours. Just by thinking about it my heart sinks. How would have I known 
that he is going to do this to me. Oh you fool, 
that's what I used to tell you. That guys in this category
trap silly girls like you in their love. And then girls like you lose their
money, life everything over them. Your dad has done a favor to you by taking you back in. For God's sake, Nosheen. Please have
mercy on us and get back to your senses. Rectify your conduct. This is your last chance. Enough already. You guys bothered me so much by
repeating one thing over and over again. A human can commit mistakes. Nosheen you are referring what you did
 as a mistake only? No human can commit such mistakes 
what you have done. Okay. But for your information I am telling
you that I have apologized to everyone. But no one is ready to give up 
showing attitude. Who are you talking about? I'm talking about everyone. Okay, dad is like that. But brother? Why are his collars to stiff suddenly? Talk with respect. 
He is your elder brother. I am not going to respect anyone. 
Do they care about me? What is wrong? What have they done? I have never been so humiliated. When I entered the house I greeted dad and dad, he ignored me 
as if I don't even exist and he left. And brother? He just crossed the limit. He made me feel in front of Aima 
as if he was disgusted by me. In front of that Aima. Oh, so you wanted that they would have
welcomed you by showering you with flowers? They should have given you a
reception like the Queen of England, because you have done 
such a huge favor to be back home. Don't try to pose as the oppressed one. You are facing the consequences 
of what you have done. And don't expect that I am going 
to take your side next time. I don't even need you. Just go from here. I am not interested to look at you either. Just tell me that have you found out 
anything about that fraudster? I don't care, I need each 
and every penny back from him. I'm trying my best, Mama. I am want to catch him as soon as
possible even more than you guys want it. But what can I do alone, 
no body is supporting me. I'm even ready to go to the police station
and even file a complaint against him. -Well, it's good to know.
-What? That you aren't involved 
with that idiot anymore. I have a guy in mind for her. But I am waiting 
for the right time and moment. Did brother mean the same 
what I have understood? If that's the case 
then I have no objection. Why did I become unwanted Nobody knows that Nobody knows that. There has been lot of change in Zaid 
in past few months. There is one more child of yours 
in this house other than Zaid. If you have taken her back in 
then why don't you forgive her as well? Why do you keep mentioning her? Isn't it enough 
that I have allowed her back home? Actually, you dad has chosen a boy for you. Really? Yes, I don't know his name but my heart tells me 
that he has chosen Zaid for you.
