From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned to chirp from you From now on, you won't go
anywhere without asking me. You will go only if you have my
or mom's permission otherwise not. I went to my Mama's
not to meet any boyfriend. -Aima is joining office from tomorrow.
-Okay. She is starting work, this means
that everything is normal at home. I think you shouldn't delay
joining office anymore. -You tell me how can I keep everyone happy?
-Zaid, you don't need to keep everyone happy. Just keep Zoya happy. Even I wanted that. But it isn't possible in this situation. -Greetings.
-How was your day today? It was fine. There you go, your mother
has already poisoned you. What nonsense, Nosheen. I am right, tell me didn't she
complain about me to you? You are at fault yourself and
then you are arguing with me? I don't want to argue either, Faiq. Oh, really? Then what is it
that you are doing now? Do you know mom had to clean the
whole kitchen herself because of you. You had made such a mess. For God's sake, Faiq, when one works in
the kitchen then it's supposed to be messy. If you don't believe me
you can ask anybody. Your mother has a problem with me. No matter what I do for her,
she will never be happy. She just can't bear looking at
me in place of her favorite one. What happened? Why
are you quiet? Answer me. I don't want to give any answers. Just keep one thing in mind, if you want to see me happy you
will have to keep mom happy too. And if someone doesn't want to be
happy then what can I do about it? Look, Nosheen, nothing
is impossible in this world. Maybe you aren't trying sincerely. Sincerely? You are blindfolded
my your mother's love. And you are unable to see anything. But it's okay. Whatever I do for you both,
I can never be good enough. Look, Nosheen, I know,
mom is being tough on you. But that's not the solution to our problem. You will have to win mom's
heart. You will have to try your best. Faiq, please believe me
auntie treats me very badly. Okay, do one thing, whenever you go to the
kitchen take her with you. This way she won't have
any complains with you. No, Faiq, I won't go to your
mom's kitchen from now on. She has insulted me so much today. No, Nosheen, not so easily. Or else she would think that you
were just waiting for it to happen. Nosheen, say sorry to mom and next time take her with you so
that you work under her supervision. And please get my clothes ready,
I have to go out on a dinner, I'll change. Till then I'll freshen up. Such a tough bone he is,
all the drama for nothing. Oh my God, Zaid, it's a 28-day
trip, it's going to be so much fun. Aren't you excited? No, no, I am excited. -Are you sure?
-Yes, of course. What? Nothing, it's just that your expressions
and words aren't syncing with each other. It's not like that, Zoya.
It's just that it's a 28-day trip. We have so less time. One has to manage so many things. Leaving the house for a month,
it's not easy. Yeah, I get you. What things and what people
you are talking about. It's not that, Zoya, try to understand. Why should I have to
understand every time? Why can't others understand
that we both have a life too. We both deserve some privacy too, Zaid. Yeah, you are right,
I'm handling the situation. Tell me honestly, Zaid. If you can't
manage then I am going to say no to mom. For God's sake Zoya, what are you saying? Of course I want to go on
this trip, I want to go with you. And why do you get
aggressive on everything? I'm sorry. Zaid, I hope nobody is going to
have any issues with us leaving. Why would anyone have any problem? We'll go, we'll definitely go. Okay then, I am going to look at all
the locations where we have to travel. Look, Zaid, look at this, such a beautiful location. We are going to get
a picture here for sure. Done. Wait a second, Zaid, scuba diving. You'll come with me for that, won't you? Zaid, promise me that
you will come with me. No promise me right now. I promise, we'll do it. Zaid, look, I really need this trip. I am too tired. You know what? I get it. Honestly
I am too stressed myself these days and you know what, let's go have some fun. Done! We are going to
go and forget everything. Yeah, yeah sure. You know what,
let me get some hotel bookings done. Why are you looking at her? Talk to me. Actually, Dad, what happened was... You don't need to worry. In fact you should be happy. I have no objection on
your choice. I'm really happy. Dad, seriously? What's wrong with that?
The girl is well known to us. Come, come. I was pulling your son's leg. You ought to do that in such matters. We thought of him as a kid, but he
has proven to be a hidden warrior. Before I started looking for girls for him,
he has made things easy for us himself. Yes, you should be happy.
He has solved your problem. Yes, I'm really happy. After all he
has chosen the girl of my choice. I was just checking your fever, so... I have told you so many
times to stay away from me. How can I leave you in this condition? Dad has given me the
responsibility to take care of you. I don't need anyone. Whatever happened, what's going to happen
in future, I'm responsible for that myself. Stop being so stubborn.
Till when is this going to go on? You have been like this since a week. You should keep in mind that you aren't
just hurting yourself but all of us as well. I haven't hurt anyone, Aima, nor
anybody needs to worry about me. How can we not worry about you? You are very important for us. Do you have any idea in what
condition dad brought you home? We all got so worried after
knowing about your accident. What if anything happened to you, Zaid? It would have been better,
your lives would have been easier. I have told you already that they
were satisfied till our last project. Something has gone wrong. Otherwise it is out of
question that Imran industries gives such a major
project to someone else. Did you mail them? Really? So when have they set the meeting? Yeah okay, I hope there isn't any issue. I want that client at any cost,
okay, you can't let them go. They are our biggest and oldest client. Understand? Okay, bye. Oh, Zain, come, I was about to call you. Come sit. Everything okay, Dad? Yeah, I have set your
meeting with Imran Industries. But their office has shifted to Islamabad. Don't worry about that,
your ticket will be booked. In fact, take Aima with you too. Because she was on their last project
and they were very satisfied with her. But Zaid, you have to
convince this client at any cost. We can't lose them. Because if they leave our company's
reputation will suffer great loss that we can't afford right now. They are the biggest client in the market,
who make their payments timely as well. You get my point? Yes, Dad. I have confidence in you both that you
are going to get this client back to us. What's wrong, Zaid? Is there
something you are worried about? Dad, actually I cam to
talk to you about something. Go ahead. Actually, Dad, I'm a little confused. I
think I won't be able to go to Islamabad. Actually, auntie has booked
mine and Zoya's tickets for Europe. I was just a bit confused. Our flight is in two days. Fine. See for yourself. Whatever you think
is more important, you shall go there. I leave that decision to you, you decide. Mother thinks that after Zaid came to my room,
everything has got normal. But she doesn't know that some
decisions are never reversed. Did you talk to Zaid? Did he say anything? No. -Did he?
-He didn't come to my room. And even if he did, what
would have he said to me? That he is indebted that I have destroyed
his happily married life? Why are you thinking like that? What should I think then?
Haven't I committed a sin? It would be better if
we don't talk right now. I am in such a situation
right now that I'm hearing something else
and understanding something else. Try to understand. Are you feeling all right?
I'm worried about you. Yes, I am fine. Don't worry about me. Where are you going in such condition. Aima, please, I have
told you to leave me alone. My relationship with
Zaid is just like that too. That the decisions between it
are going to remain the same. But I can't tell that to mother. I will have to stay happy in
front of her for her own happiness. You won't believe, Mom,
I have already made plans. Scuba diving, sky diving,
late night beach walk. Thank you so much. Okay, listen, Waheed told me
that he has arranged for cabs online, so that you both don't have any issue. And if you get any other bookings
too then you may call Waheed. You're the best mom ever. I just want that my
daughter always stays happy. Listen, where is Zaid? Is he happy? Of course, Mom, why wouldn't he be happy? Okay, now be careful,
someone may create some drama. Who are you talking about? There are so many people in your house who
must not be liking that you both are going. Yeah, that's true. Okay, listen, no matter what
anyone says, just ignore them. And prepare Zaid for it too. I don't want your plan to get
rescheduled because of anybody. You get my point? Yeah, Mom, don't worry, nothing
as such is going to happen. Zaid has promised me. With due apologies, please don't mind, but your Zaid is an arrant fool. He has no opinion of his own, and in front
of his dad he just can't say anything. Mom, don't worry, we will go. Okay, if you are that sure
then I won't say anything more. Yes, Mom, I will handle
everything, don't worry, okay? And listen, do keep warm
clothes like over coat etc. Yeah, Mom, in fact I have got
two leather jackets for myself. I'll just send you their picture, okay? Bye. Okay, take care of yourself. Bless you. What do you mean he can't come. I don't care if it is his family
commitment or any other thing. Tell him that he has to attend
tomorrow's meeting, okay? What? Which hospital? Oh! You should have told me that before. Yeah, okay, tell him to take care of
his mother, I'll so something. Yeah, okay, I'll manage. Brother, everything all right?
You seem a little worried. Yeah, there is an issue at work,
I'm just worried about that. Anything serious? Yeah kind of, but I'm trying, it
will resolve soon if God wills. If God wills. You tell me, everything all right? Yeah, actually when sister Farhana heard
about Zaid and Aima's marriage then... She wants to invite us for dinner. That's really nice, when do we
have to go? We'll definitely go there. But this issue going on at your office... What does the official
issue has to do with it? I keep my personal and
professional life separate. -It's okay then.
-So, when do we have to go? -She said if we could come tomorrow.
-Tomorrow, okay we all will go then. -Let's go, make me a cup of tea.
-Sure. Where's Zaid, Aima? I have no idea. Why, what happened? Everything all right? I thought everything was fine, but it's been 4 hours now and Zaid
hasn't replied any of my calls or messages. He might be busy. That's why he couldn't
reply to your messages. How can he be that busy that
he isn't even able to reply me? I don't have any idea about that. Where did you see him last? I saw him in the lawn.
Yeah, I saw him there. Did he say anything? No, nothing, in fact I went to talk to him. So he seemed a little disturbed. What do you mean? You went to meet him? Anyway, forget it, did he tell
you why he was disturbed? No, I don't have any idea about that. -How can this be, Aima?
-What do you mean? I mean, he shares every problem with
you, he must have said something. He used to. Not anymore. Isn't there any alternate? No, sir, right now we don't have
anybody to work on this project. Where is the rest of the team
which was dealing with this project? Sir Hassan was on it, his
mother is in the hospital and in a very serious
condition so he has taken off. And Farooq? Sir Farooq has the same issue, his wife has some medical issue so
he had applied for leave long before. Sir, Mr. Azmat called, he said that he
is going to go for this meeting himself. Dad's going to go? He was telling that you are busy, so may be
he is going to go himself, with Madam Aima. -Are their flights booked yet?
-No, sir. They said he will confirm me
once it's done. All right. Sir, I think, Mr, Azmat isn't
comfortable with going himself. Because the owners don't
attend such meetings themselves. They will be having their team too, and Mr. Sadaqat won't be
present in the meeting too. Yeah, I know the team
attends such meetings. Okay, I'll do something about it,
please go and brief the accounts about it. Okay, sir, thank you. Zaid I have been noticing that you are
ignoring everything related to that girl. I have told you this
a lot of times before too. But I don't see that you are
giving importance to what I say. Zaid, if you have taken the responsibility
then you will have to fulfill it as well. It's important, you will be
answerable for that as a husband. God may let go of his rights but he will not forgive if one
doesn't give people their due rights. Aima is your wife give her, her due rights. You have to give her her rights
either you want to or not. If Aima stays quiet that doesn't mean that you treat her as you like and nobody
is going to question you about it too. I can't see injustice being
done to anyone in my house. Half of my life is spend
advising my wife and daughter to be fair to my sister and niece. And I don't want that rest of my
life is spent in lecturing you about it. Dad, please don't worry, I will go for the meeting. Yeah, but you going alone
isn't appropriate at all. You must have to take someone along. They have such a big team how
are you going to handle them alone? I'm thinking of coming along with you. So would it be appropriate for you to go? Well it isn't but I don't
have any other option either. I'm actually very worried. Don't worry, there are still
two days left for the meeting. We will find an option eventually. Did you talk to Zaid? Yeah, I did. But right now he has more
important things to do than this. Anyway, we will have to go for the meeting. If you are ready to come, then
I'll get your and my seats booked. Okay, fine, Dad. Hello, yeah, Mr. Danish, please book two seats for me and Aima to go
for the meeting of Salman group of Industries. Wait a minute, Dad. I'll just call you back,
hold it for a minute. You don't need to go,
I'm ready to go there. -Mom, sit down, Nosheen will bring it.
-Just have to get the glasses now. Be a little gentle, Nosheen. What's wrong?
I have just put the glasses down. Well you could have kept them gently too. -Is there a specific way to do that too?
-Yeah there is. Do I have to learn that as well? Nosheen, you are supposed
to put glasses on the table in such a way  that they don't make a sound. Otherwise either the glass will
break or the table might get a scratch. And if the glass breaks, 
you might get hurt too. If I can't do this right even,
why don't you keep a servant then? You do not hire servants for everything. The women in the house
should do some tasks too. And where is it written? Nosheen, instead of arguing,
why don't have your meal quietly? Faiq, pass her the kebabs. I don't want these. What's wrong with you? You have been behaving so strangely since 
I have returned home. Are you in your senses? What do you care? 
All you care about is your mother. Mind your language, got it? This is how I talk. Then do one thing, 
get up from here and get lost. As if you are so well-mannered. 
Have you ever noticed your tone? My tone gets bad when
your attitude gets bad. Faiq, how are you both
talking to each other? I wish you had taught some
manners to your son as well, it's very easy to point fingers 
at other people's children. Will you just shut up? -What are you going to do? Hit me?
-Yeah, I'll hit you. If you won't control yourself
then I am going to even hit you. Mom. Zaid, do you have any
idea how worried I was? Okay, I'm sorry, I got stuck somewhere. You got stuck? You could have at
least replied to my messages or my calls. What's wrong, told you I'm sorry. Sorry, once again sorry. You have no idea how I
felt during these six hours. You are getting worried for no
reason, where would have I gone? What kind of weird things are you saying? What's wrong? What is it? What are you thinking? Nothing. Anyway, forget it, Listen, we have to go for
shopping, and please cheer up a bit. Show me your happy face. Smile. And we are going to go to nice
places, and I'm really excited, okay. Where are we going? What happened? -For shopping.
-Why? Zaid! I just told you that we
are going for shopping because I talked to mama and she said
that we should keep warm clothes with us. I have mine, but I think
you don't have any. So, let's go for shopping. 
Shall we go right now? Zaid, is there a problem? -Hmm.
-Hmm , again? Tell me, what happened? Zoya, we are not going on the trip. -Wait, Zoya.
-Leave my hand. Zoya, just try to understand
me, at least listen to me. Zaid, I don't want to
listen to anything you say. Zoya, I swear it's not my fault, 
I compelled to. You may stay compelled for life. Zoya, I'm really sorry, please try to understand. I said leave my hand. Zoya! You were right. I was always wrong. They are never going to let me be happy. And Zaid is just like a puppet. I am not scared of your threats, nor
am I scared of your threats to hit me. These aren't just threats, Nosheen. The way you are misbehaving, I'm afraid these threats 
might turn into reality. Mama, I can't tell you, his mother is
nothing in compared to Faiq's cleverness. My fate is ruined. 
Oh, God where did I get married. Listen madam, why are you blaming God now? His nature tried it's best that
you don't jump into this hell. But you were your own enemy. You always thing I am the one who is wrong.
