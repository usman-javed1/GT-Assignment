From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you I'm Nosheen, and this is my house. I'm really sorry, I thought
my auntie lives here. She lives with us. Didn't you see how that lady
was praising her niece? I mean, okay everybody has some qualities. But why did she need to praise her so much? I don't know, I'll change.
I wish I could go somewhere. Well, if you want you can join us. What happened? Where is she? With Faiq and Aima. With God's will. I just wish that may God keep them
really happy. May he gives them good fate. Amen. Have you guys seen Nosheen? Nosheen? Isn't she home? I didn't see her since evening.
I thought she might be in her room. But now I have looked for her in
the whole house but I can't find her. So I thought of asking you both. Call her and ask. Why don't you call her.
I can't find my phone right now. Hello, Nosheen, where are you? Dinner? With whom? All right, okay. What happened? Where is she? She is with Faiq and Aima. Auntie, did Aima tell you
that Nosheen is going with them? No she didn't tell me about it. Just Faiq and Aima were
going, that's all I know. I'll ask her when she returns. Somebody must have asked her.
How can she go like that? She is not a child anymore. Look, Zaid is saying that his
wedding reception and Aima's wedding day should be on the same day.
That's his wish. And I think there is nothing
wrong with that either. If both the children want that,
then we'll have to agree. By the way, you can discuss
it with you sister in law. Brother, she has no objection. She has left the decision
of choosing a date on me. Well, then there shouldn't be any issue. It's my son's wedding too,
my consent is important as well. You are here right now and it's being
discussed in front of you, so if you have any
objection you can say it. It's not necessary that you
fulfill all desires of children. If it's his desire, even then
what is wrong with that, tell me? If both the kids together... Look, I mean they will
get married the same day. There can be a hundred different problems, how are you going to
marriage two events at a time? There is going to be mismanagement,
in fact something unpleasant may happen. Why don't you do one thing? The dates may
be close but the events shall be separate. It would be a little easier for us. You are right. Shabana, what do you say? I think sister is right. Okay listen, there isn't much time left. When these few months
are going to end you'll never know. That's why please start
preparing for Aima's dowry. Yes, brother. I'm going to help, Shabana.
I'll take her with me. Besides, I am aware of the markets
and I can give her proper advice. Aima is our own daughter,
and Shabana isn't well as is. She won't be able to go
to the markets alone. Almas I think it's better that
you focus on Zaid's wedding. You were saying that we
should shift in the new home, so I have to focus on
the construction too. And should concentrate on the renovation you
are getting done these days and other things. First get it completed,
we'll take care of the rest later. Then you will be in a new place,
it won't be any problem then. Shabana will manage herself. Okay? Where I'm doing so many other things,
I can help Shabana too. Aima is going to go.
I'll send Aima with Shabana. She will take whatever she wants. -Okay, Shabana?
-All right, brother. -Let me make a list of the things first.
-Fine. Did you ask your sister in law
what she needs in dowry? I don't find it appropriate
asking her this. Sister, Look, I'm just saying that in your favor. This way you'll know if they want any dowry
or not. And if they do what do they want? Besides, she is Aima's auntie, and by looking at their splendor it
doesn't seem right that they ask for dowry. Either Nimra wants dowry or not
it doesn't make any difference to us. -Instead of taking useless things...
-Look, telling them, if they agree or not,
we shouldn't be concerned with that. And besides, even if they
want any dowry, then we would still give Aima
what we have to at her wedding. Yeah. What happened, Zaid?
Why are you sitting so worried here? Nothing, Dad, just like that. I know you're worried
because you're getting married, right? No, not at all. I'm not worried about
marriage at all. In fact I'm happy. But, yeah I'm a little anxious if I will be able to take care
of my relationships properly. I can understand. I've been through it. By the way, what do you think?
Is Zoya a good match for you? Of course, dad, I'm really happy with Zoya.
And I'm sure we'll do great. And besides the
relationship we have, our friendship, that is
rarely found in couples. Look, son, it's nice that you
are confident about your decision but you can look away from the truth. What truth, Dad? Zaid, this friendship, pre-marriage and post-marriage friendship
is very different from each other. I'm telling this from my experience. Just friendship can't make
a marriage successful, Because the friendship is
limited to just two people,  where as marriage
isn't limited just two, Then what is it that strengthens
the relationship of marriage, Dad? There are a few things,
but to me husband and wife should
have the sense of responsibility. It would be better that you both
fulfill your responsibilities properly. If you decide that, you won't
have any problem in future. Yes, Dad, we are discussing that. By the way, Dad, what do you think?
Am I going to become a good husband? Yes, I have started seeing
your sense of responsibility now. Then why are you worried? I'm not worried about you. Anyway... Forget it. Dad, why do I get a feeling
that you don't think much of Zoya? It's nothing like that. Look,
Zoya is one of our own, she is your cousin,
why would I have any objection on her? Still, Dad, I feel like you don't
reveal your opinion about that. No, no, it's not like that.
She is a good girl. Then what is it, Dad? Zaid, although I left your
decisions on you guys, I gave you all the authority. But as a father, it's my duty. I think about you. I analyze the decisions you kids take 
through my experience. That's why I'm worried. There is something, Dad. 
Don't you like my and Zoya's relationship? No, no, I've accepted it, but...
but still, dear... Look, I just want that you avoid
those mistakes in your married life  that I have faced. Dad, you're talking to me. To your son. Whatever is in your heart, please
say it without hesitation. I won't mind. I... Zoya seems a little irresponsible to me,
and I've observed that she doesn't have the ability
or the interest to take responsibility. And it isn't easy to run a household. Housekeeping, husband, in-laws, 
one has to take care of everyone. Every relation 
has it's own set of responsibilities. It's really important 
to take every thing along. I'm just trying to teach you that I have
learned from my unsuccessful married life. Why are you saying that, Dad? Because my marriage 
is an unsuccessful marriage. One of us hasn't fulfilled 
their responsibility and you can see yourself
what are the consequences of it. Where is your brother today? You sister.. Anyway, forget it. You should teach Zoya 
how to take responsibility. Look at Aima, she is the same age as hers. But still she has 
the qualities to run a household. But, Dad, not everyone is the same. I mean, sure Zoya's values
and habits are different from Aima but don't worry, we'll make it work. I'm hopeful that you can fulfill your
responsibilities too,  and you'll convince her to do so as well. -Anyways, you don't need to worry.
-Not at all. Come let's have a nice coffee, come on. What have you done, Aima?
Who told you to act so intelligent? What do you mean? Why did you take Nosheen along? This
was supposed to be your special moment. And you involved Nosheen in it? You're so stupid. Zaid, at least don't blame me. Really? Who else should I blame? I didn't even know 
that she is coming with us. When I went to the car 
she was already sitting inside. This girl is getting clever 
more than required. She thinks that if no one is
going to pay attention to her then she is going to do whatever she likes. I'll take care of her. Zaid, please, please
don't say anything to her. A mountain of a mole hill
will be maid for no reason. For no reason? 
Is this something small for you? You should have got her out of the car, 
or called me or dad. Zaid, we aren't kids anymore that
we take small complaints to our elders. And besides Faiq was there,
may be Nosheen went with his consent. I really feel ashamed 
calling her my sister. I know that she is used to create a scene, she is used to seek attention. But don't say anything to her. Just let it go and end this discussion. Anyway, how was you day?How was Faiq? Faiq? Faiq was nice. We talked about a lot of things. Yeah right, you talked 
about a lot of things. What would have you guys talked
about in presence of that witch, Nosheen. We talked as much as we could. Anyway for get it, I'm glad, 
I'm really happy for you. Phew, Nosheen. So, when are you meeting him again? Yeah, you're right. It's just that 
brother has made my life hell. He has been a headache to me all the time. Nosheen, -I have to talk to you.
-I'm busy right now. -What do you think?
-What the hell? That if we don't remind you that
doesn't mean that we all have forgotten. Are you going to do whatever you want? Have you forgotten what you have done? -Who the hell are you to forgive me?
-Behave yourself, both of you. You guys keep fighting wildly all the time. Mama, does she even deserve 
that one should behave well with her? Oh, hello, mister. You are the one 
who came here to talk to me. So behave yourself 
and give me my phone back. Just wait a minute, Zaid. What's wrong? 
Why are you getting angry on her? Mama, actually you should be 
the one getting angry on her. But why, Zaid? Tell me. The thing she has done... I don't have time to
listen to this nonsense. Mama, tell him to return my phone. Mind your language. 
Would you like to get slapped at your age? Give her phone. Zaid, 
give her phone. Give it to me. -Give it. 
-You're not doing right. Take it. You have spoiled her. It's your
support only that she is doing all this. Will somebody tell me what she has done? She tagged along on Aima's date. Aren't you ashamed 
of interfering anybody else's date? -What? I interfered?
-Yeah who else? You both keep your voices low. I won't keep my voice
low. I'm not afraid of anyone. And who told you 
that I went as an uninvited guest? She is lying, Mama. 
Aima hadn't invited her. Who is talking about your Aima?
It was Faiq who invited me. -Faiq?
-You liar, why would he ask you? He doesn't even know you.
I don't believe her, she is lying. Am I lying? Let me call Faiq, 
everything will be cleared then. -What are you doing?
-I'm making you guys hear the truth as I am a liar. Mama, stop her, look what is she doing? Faiq, tell me, who asked me 
to come with you and Aima? Just answer me please, Faiq. Okay, thanks, bye. I hope everything is clear to you guys now. And you, stay away from my life. Did you see her, Mama? Didn't she clear everything? 
Faiq invited her and she accepted. What's the big deal in it, Zaid? Hello, yeah, what's up? I thought all is well at your end. No, man, nothing's well. Why? What happened? There was a huge scene created at home. Your family is really conservative. They didn't like me going 
with you and Aima. What's there to mind in it? -There isn't but...
-But what? -I don't understand how to tell you this.
-Tell me whatever it is. Aima created a big scene when she got back. She told everyone 
that I forced you guys to take me. And then what, everyone was after me. I went just like that, 
and that too because you asked me to. Yeah, but I think this isn't 
that big an issue. If you say, should I talk to Aima? No, no. Don't say anything or there are
going to be more problems created for me. You just cleared it 
over the phone, that's enough. Okay fine. So, what are you up to? I just got done 
dealing with all this issue. Your fiance is just... You are stuck at the wrong place. Sorry, I hope you didn't mind. No, it's not like that. Okay listen, should I tell you 
something interesting? No, no, I told you to keep it ready. The driver is coming
to you in half an hour. Okay. -Greetings, Mom.
-Greetings, where was my son all day? I'm sorry, Mom. I had
to go to a meeting, when I got back I got a call,
so got a little busy. -Was it Aima?
-No. Then who? It was a friend's call, that's why. You didn't tell me 
how your date with Aima go? What did you guys talk about? And
most importantly, how did you like Aima? She's fine, she's nice. What is it, Faiq? It doesn't seem so 
by the way you said it. Whatever it is in your
heart tell that to me honestly. Mom, you know 
that I'm an open-minded person. I think that Aima is 
of a little orthodox mentality. Means, if tomorrow I talk 
to my friends she might mind it. Besides, Mom, 
I don't like such girls anyways. But if you have selected her, 
then she must be something. Dear, noble girls are usually 
shy like that. They don't talk much. Yes, but one can tell their likes and dislikes
by being within the limits of nobility. I know it very well 
that she doesn't talk much. It's in her nature to stay quiet. But if you are going to give her some time,
she'll get completely normal with you. -It takes time for some girls to get frank.
-How much more time, Mom? You know since the day our marriage
is fixed, she hasn't contacted me once. She could have contacted me herself. But I feel like she isn't giving me 
a chance to understand her. Okay, let's do one thing, Faiq. I've
invited Aima's family over lunch tomorrow. You can talk to her privately. And I'm sure there must be  
a misunderstanding between you two. You can tell her that
you would really like if she calls you herself and
asks about your well being. Okay, Mom. Faiq, I have sincerely 
got you both together. I have considered a lot of
other girls for you, but as a daughter-in-law only
Aima seemed suitable for you. And I'm sure, Mom, 
 your choice can never be wrong. With God's will. -Now please, order some tea, I'll have tea and leave.
-All right. Akbar! Sister Nimra where is 
our dear Faiq? Didn't see him. He just got back from a meeting. 
He'll be here after freshening up. Oh, all right. And how is my daughter doing? -I'm doing good, and you?
-I'm good too. I just got a little tired 
as I was in the kitchen since morning. You should have called me, 
I would have helped you out. You have to take care 
of all this when you're here. I can do it until I can. Auntie, where is the washroom? -Let me take you.
-No, just let me know, I'll go by myself. Okay, go yourself then. Faiq's room is on the right, 
and guest room is on the left. You can use the washroom there. Okay, fine. Thanks. Nosheen, you here? Actually I wanted to use the bathroom
and I came to your room by mistake. I hope you didn't mind. No, it's okay. 
Sorry, I intruded your privacy. By the way, there is a washroom 
in the other room too, you could have gone there. Yeah, I'll go. Wow, guitar? Do you know how to play a guitar? No I used to play when in college, 
so I bought one. Okay. I'm sure you must have broken 
a lot of girls' hearts. No, it's not like that. Will you teach me how to play a guitar? I never learned it myself. 
I just bought it because I liked to play. Means you don't 
want to teach me how to play. -Okay, no problem, I'll teach you.
-Sure. Can you please take my picture?
I'll have my today's DP. Nosheen, I'll take your picture later. 
Everyone is waiting outside. Okay, fine. Had Hussein been alive today, 
he would have been the happiest. You are absolutely right, brother. I miss brother Hussein every moment. And he would have been 
the happiest on this union. It's just... He would be happy right
now too, sister, Nimra. He really thought 
of you as someone very close. To tell you the truth, Shabana,
when I meet you and Aima  I feel like I'm meeting my brother. Hussein was very dear to me. May he rest in peace. Let's change the topic, I've made everyone
emotional by talking about Hussein. Brother, even if our dear ones leave,
their memories don't leave our hearts. It seems as if they are with us. You're right, that's how it is. Now where is this boy? Oh! See, Shabana, Faiq had asked me to iron his
shirt and I kept sitting here and forgot.  He must be waiting I'll be right back. Sister, why are you going? Aima's here, she'll iron the shirt. Auntie, just tell me, I'll iron it. -No, no, you keep sitting.
-No, Aima will do it. She irons really well. Go ahead, dear. Okay, fine. Go Aima, 
you'll have to do it in future too. You go and iron his shirt. -Where's the shirt?
- In Faiq's room. Go. Oh, no, mama didn't even iron it. Hey let me iron it. No, Nosheen it's okay. I'll do it myself. Faiq it's just a shirt, let me do it. It'll take just two minutes, 
I'll do it, no problem. -Faiq, I'll do it...
-I told you... Aima! I had to iron my shirt, so, Nosheen... Yeah, I told him that I'm going to iron it. Actually, auntie, sent me to do that. Yeah, so Nosheen will iron it, 
till then come in we can talk. No, what is she going to do here? Why don't you go to the kitchen and
help auntie? She must be working alone. No, that's not an issue. 
Mom is used to work alone. Aima, come in. No, I've got something 
to do in the kitchen. I told you she won't sit here. I know my cousin better than you. Okay, let me iron the shirt now. Sister, even after so many years 
food made by you is still amazing. The same taste. It was so delicious. Shabana is right, the food 
was so good that  I overate, believe me. Having green tea was necessary right now. Thank you so much. It's enough for me that you
liked the food. My hard work paid off. Auntie, specially
the kebabs were really good. Will you teach me how 
to make such kebabs? Please? Sure, why not, dear? 
Are you fond of cooking? Oh yes, other than traditional dishes 
like Qorma and biryani she makes really good pizza and lasagne. That's really good that she 
has learned all that in this age. Yeah, I have this rule that girls should
learn how to cook by the age of 18. Without compromising on their education. Nosheen is Aima's age right? No, she is two years younger than Aima. Really? What are you studying? You should as what she doesn't study. She has books around her
all the time. So much so that she even makes
dishes from recipes from magazines. No, I meant to ask that which institute
does she go to? What's her qualification? Actually, I'm giving exams 
on private basis, for A-levels. But why private? Why didn't you
take admission in some good college? Actually, auntie, my time
was getting wasted in college. Colleges these days focus
more on parties and events and I'm not involved 
in all this, that's why. Actually me and Azmat let
kids decide in such matters. No matter if it's about studies, 
career or marriage. That's really great. -Is your younger son coming for the wedding?
-Just don't ask about him. He is settled there. And says that I
don't want to come to Pakistan at all. Well, I think he's right. 
What is left here. No, whatever it is. Our country is our own. Yes, sister, ask Asim, 
he must come for the wedding. Yes, Shabana is
absolutely right about that. By the way, why don't you choose
a girl for your younger son too? They both will get married at the expense
of one and their homes will be settled too. Let the ones who are getting
married, get married first. No, actually my younger son 
doesn't intend to get married right now. So when he wants to
get married, we'll see then. Yes, you are right. Besides, there is no issue with boys. Mothers are usually
worried about their girls. Because, you see, you never know what kind
of husband she gets, how the in laws are? By the way, Shabana 
is really lucky in this regard. I just wish that I get my daughter's
mother in law just like you are. That's your greatness. Aima, what is it? You're really quite. No, it's nothing, I'm fine. Yeah, when her fiance is outside,
why would she like it between the elders? Zaid, I think, auntie is forcing Zaid 
to marry me, he doesn't like me. Nosheen, everything all right? 
You called so early in the morning? Yeah, actually I was getting bored, 
so I thought of calling you. Mom, I'm going to Dubai for a shoot. Dubai? Your dad has given permission
for you to join college again. Really? I have booked an apartment for Aima. And I've opened a bank
account for her personal use. So, these are all the documents for those.
