[5.96] smell When I
[8.20] saw
[10.92] you I
[17.36] learnt to chirp because of you Brother the plan should be simple, the
[20.48] girl goes to the house, learns the way and then gets married

[25.68] girl, Aama is intelligent, you can't waste her life,
[28.20] can you? Bhaijaan he is
[30.56] my dad and to take care of my dad there is my maternal uncle,
[32.80] now why don't you worry about your daughter Aama,
[38.12] keep Zaid away from this girl I don't like his intentions
[49.04] I can guess, Bhaijaan that's why I told him that I should
[52.76] first consult with brother then I will
[56.08] tell him that's fine but Shana
[58.92] for now refuse him by giving some suitable excuse

[86.52] know good proposals don't come again and again,

[447.40] yes, you both
[450.68] talk, I am a tea seller, oh, I
[455.76] remembered that I have a friend, she is looking for girls for her brother-in-law,
[459.72] nowadays there are many
[462.48] well-off people, her brother-in-law also does some
[465.00] business,
[467.76] but you know, Zoya is
[471.28] not ready for marriage yet, well, then
[474.40] this, I remembered that you also have daughters in your house,
[477.52] Mashallah,
[480.56] so I mentioned them to my friend, so
[482.40] what did she
[484.68] say, she said that after talking to her brother-in-law,
[487.76] she will tell me, they are
[489.96] very good people, they are very rich, they are
[493.64] not even asking for marriage, otherwise
[497.80] where do you find such people these days,
[501.36] this is a good thing, that's it  I was thinking
[506.00] that how good it would be if Amma gets married to them,
[512.20] now let's see how much Azmat Bhai will do for you
[515.76] people
[516.86] [Sangeet],
[519.20] others should see it, now
[521.80] Azmat will say a little to himself
[523.45] [Sangeet]
[530.80] I will go and see, it's getting late, I will
[535.12] bring the tea
[538.48] [Sangeet]
[560.48] Hello Assalam Walekum Pappu how are
[564.44] you, yes, this Ammi is sitting next to me,
[569.52] Kupo's
[575.08] call Walekum
[578.72] Assalam ji, I am absolutely fine,
[583.56] yes I spoke to Bhai,
[587.56] but we cannot do it right now
[592.40] and Aima is also studying, right, yes,
[600.00] you are absolutely right, but when
[604.28] Aima completes her studies, we will
[608.96] think about it later, Inshallah,
[616.96] definitely, I will
[620.00] come, Allah [
[622.22] Sangeet]
[624.40] Hafiz Amma, what were you talking about,
[627.72] nothing
[630.32] son, she was talking about your marriage for your FF, so
[634.40] what did you
[638.28] say, what should I say, I was happy
[642.18] [Sangeet],
[645.68] but Bhai refused, he said, let
[649.72] Aima study
[651.10] [Sangeet]
[653.16] first, Baba said absolutely right, I still have
[657.00] a lot to do, yes, okay,
[660.80] but son, good relationships do not happen again and again
[666.64] Why did we meet? I am not aware of
[671.36] this.
[675.48] [Sangeet] I do
[677.24] n't know what is going on in brother's mind.
[682.00] But Amma Faiq is not older than me. There is not
[689.68] that much difference.
[692.12] Son, there must be a difference of about seven years.
[699.36] And you know
[702.80] that there was a difference between me and your father too.
[707.20] Amma Jaan, in those days, such marriages were acceptable.
[711.12] Nowadays, there should not be so much difference.
[713.76] Son, no matter what the time, the
[717.12] difference does not matter.
[719.67] [Sangeet]
[722.28] Marriage is successful with patience and understanding.
[726.48] If pride and stubbornness come in between, then the
[730.68] relationship is left behind.
[737.72] [Sangeet]
[741.44] Amma,
[744.64] mother, I want to ask you something. Amma, what are you saying?
[749.84] You don't need permission to ask me anything.
[753.84] [Sangeet] Hey
[759.92] son, do you like anyone?
[763.23] [Sangeet]
[764.64] What kind of a question is this?
[768.84] Amma, look son, nowadays
[773.04] girls often make an ideal in their heart
[778.04] and
[780.48] also like a boy like that. So
[784.20] I thought of asking you. There is no
[786.48] such thing.
[791.24] But, if it is so, then son,
[797.64] remember that loving someone is a habit,
[802.64] but if you don't
[805.60] get that person, then your love will end.  Never be stubborn
[809.72] but why
[812.80] ammi because
[815.68] son we get only what is destined for us
[820.44] [sangeet] it
[827.96] means that there is someone no no
[832.48] ammi there is no such thing
[836.32] I was just thinking about what you said
[839.96] [sangeet]
[856.48] Baba it is very interesting for you may you live long thank you
[860.72] very much thank you
[863.36] tea looks very good from your face itself where else would you have been you do
[866.76] n't even have time to sit with baba it is
[869.24] possible that I don't have time for you then
[871.64] I felt it was wrong maybe no no you can never make a
[876.76] mistake it is possible that I have been
[879.56] negligent how dare I ever
[884.16] argue on any matter or question you whatever you
[887.68] say is the last thing for me
[891.96] then why what how nothing remains stay
[896.28] safe live long may Allah give you a long life
[903.00] amen well I had told your mother to let
[906.48] you study now marriage will happen
[908.56] you don't have any objection you are upset
[910.84] with my words whatever you have thought for me you must have
[913.44] thought for the best stay happy son
[917.56] stay alive you always respect me my
[920.40] baba if I am happy then I am happy may Allah
[923.92] always keep you safe on my head
[925.88] you also did not live after drinking tea  Have you had your
[929.64] breakfast before me, how was it?
[932.68] Very good, very
[938.64] good Zoya, check it. I
[941.80] remember I got a message from the girl to whom I had given my number yesterday.
[944.52] You should be
[948.04] happy with this friend, will you stop being jealous?
[951.36] Excuse me, it doesn't matter to me whether
[954.88] you talk to one girl or
[957.24] all the girls in the university. I don't care,
[960.00] right friend, stay a little away from me or if you are
[963.08] burning too much, I am feeling hot.
[964.72] Please, ok, Ima, you should
[967.84] listen to his nonsense a little. Yes, what nonsense, he who
[971.36] keeps himself happy by doing it with girls. Actually,
[975.84] both of you don't value me. The day you will
[978.76] realize my value, you will regret a lot.
[981.72] Mark my words, you will regret a lot. ok, ok, you have
[984.20] some misunderstanding. What
[985.68] ever,
[990.80] by the way, lost and sad, where were you, what were you doing,
[995.52] thank God, the firing of you both is
[998.40] over, I was taking the class and
[1001.60] where were you both missing? I got late
[1005.16] but he was engrossed in thoughts of that girl.
[1007.76] No, no, I actually knew, I was
[1010.64] confident that Ayawa would take the class, so I said,
[1013.44] what is the need for us to take him, he is in the class
[1015.88] and  Sir I am asking about both of you
[1020.16] so what did you say what did I say I
[1023.40] made an excuse for both of you useless people can
[1025.52] you
[1027.97] [Music]
[1031.12] Believe me friend if you are a friend then just like this yes yes of course
[1034.28] come this was the last time yes yes done done okay done okay okay okay okay come let's
[1039.96] go to eat something she is always hungry she gets up I will
[1043.20] make a meal and Zoya see this happens
[1048.00] friend
[1055.68] brother today you are going to office late no it was just that night I
[1061.00] slept a little late that's why I am fine are
[1064.40] you well are you not well no I am not well
[1066.60] this just happens with time
[1069.32] now
[1070.84] where has Almas gone out okay okay okay
[1076.73] [Music]
[1079.60] what happened are you worried
[1082.96] no brother I am not worried then what are you thinking
[1088.44] Almas has said something tell me no no
[1092.12] Bhabhi did not say anything to me look
[1095.16] Shabana you cannot be worried without a reason I
[1097.32] know very well brother you are getting
[1099.48] worried for no reason I was thinking
[1102.68] that Aima is a fatherless daughter
[1109.40] and it is not possible that wherever she goes
[1113.44] a good proposal comes from there what have
[1117.00] you said  A fatherless
[1121.28] daughter, I am not her father. She is dearer to me than my life. I love
[1127.08] her as much as I love Nosheen.
[1129.08] No brother, there is no such thing. But the reality is that
[1133.60] I feel that if a good proposal is
[1136.28] available for Ama, we should definitely look for it.
[1142.12] Look,
[1144.12] I know that because of me, you have
[1148.08] lost faith in me. Bhaijaan,
[1151.84] you should not think like this. You may not even
[1155.76] say it. I know that
[1159.20] I talked about Amaad and Yama's marriage.
[1162.44] Now how would I know that Ama will cheat me and
[1165.04] leave in the middle. No brother, I am
[1167.72] saying this because
[1169.68] yesterday Amber came and
[1172.04] said that there is a good proposal. The
[1175.72] boy is very good and has his own business.
[1178.68] And then he will not even
[1181.40] take dowry. Now how did this matter of dowry come in between.
[1185.96] Everything that I have to buy for Nosheen, I will buy the
[1188.96] same for Ama as well. Now, as far as the matter of the
[1192.40] proposal is concerned, I do
[1196.16] not want to say anything at this time. But I am
[1201.28] her mother. Whatever you decide for her, it is better.
[1204.88] Brother, do not take my words wrong. I do
[1208.68] not have any such thing in my mind.  You have every right.
[1212.56] Whatever decision you take for Aima, you will do it for the best. I will
[1220.24] not talk to you about this anymore. So that's it. Then just
[1224.20] believe that whatever I think for Nosheen, the
[1227.28] same will be for Aima too.
[1229.36] I am completely sure that
[1233.28] you don't know what happened. I do
[1238.08] n't want this.
[1242.20] [Music]
[1248.24] Sir, try to understand. It is
[1252.64] very difficult for me to go out of the house these days.
[1256.20] Dad comes early. It is
[1260.92] impossible to go out of the office at night.
[1263.84] My exams are also over. There is no
[1266.84] excuse.
[1268.40] Well, don't get angry. I will think of something. In
[1273.00] fact, I will do one thing. Tomorrow I will come to meet you on the pretext of shopping.
[1276.16] But only for a little
[1279.40] while. And
[1281.80] during the day, okay, now you put the phone down. If someone comes, it will become a
[1286.40] problem.
[1290.96] You don't know my father.
[1296.72] Okay, now put it down.
[1300.72] Fun, bye.
[1304.26] [Music]
[1329.65] [Music]
[1336.28] How is this possible? How is it possible that a
[1339.48] girl was chatting with boys in front of you
[1341.92] and so much was happening under your nose?
[1343.76] You didn't even know.
[1346.48] You have some misunderstanding.
[1350.16] You have misunderstood that you talked about a child.  It is
[1352.56] not a good upbringing that this life should not be spent like this
[1354.52] I have already thrown my
[1357.44] son out of the house due to misunderstandings now stop taunting him on every small thing don't
[1359.40] change the topic now
[1362.16] answer what I am asking did you know that she
[1364.56] talks to boys no you don't know how you would know that the one who
[1371.00] talks behind other's children she is getting up to cannot look after her own
[1372.76] daughter how would you know
[1374.76] what do you want to say
[1376.76] I want to say that the relation you are looking for for others for
[1381.12] Ama along with Shabana find one for your Nausheen
[1383.36] Nausheen is of studying age when
[1385.92] she will be of marriageable age I will see she is studying
[1389.68] which one she is studying she is of studying age
[1391.88] but she is not studying
[1394.00] once I get to know who that boy is then I will make it up in
[1398.08] such a way that all her misunderstandings will be cleared
[1400.60] without you investigating
[1403.24] why are you getting so angry should I explain to her
[1405.48] this time look at Nausheen no matter how many times I have
[1408.52] given warning now time has passed
[1410.96] she has crossed all limits now  Explain, take her
[1414.40] mobile phone, make her sit at home, she will not go to college,
[1416.84] what are you saying, I did not say anything that
[1419.40] you cannot understand,
[1421.64] such a big decision, her studies will be stopped midway, if
[1423.68] studies have been stopped then go to hell, I
[1426.20] told her that from today onwards she will
[1428.60] not go to college, take her telephone back from her,
[1431.08] find a good match for her and
[1434.20] send her to her home, her studies will be stopped midway, I got it disconnected, I don't know
[1437.44] what is left now,

[1569.96] Baba Jaan has taken a very strict decision in
[1572.72] this way poor Nausheen's studies will be affected a lot
[1578.06] [Music]
[1581.92] Amma, why are you not saying anything?
[1589.00] What should I say? The
[1590.56] son and his father think for
[1595.28] him, whatever they
[1602.04] think will be good. You are right, but the
[1605.32] poor girl's mistake was not so big that she should be forced to leave
[1608.24] her studies.
[1613.16] Look
[1615.96] son, I don't want to talk about their matter. I
[1621.56] just pray to Allah that whatever happens should be for the
[1625.96] betterment of that girl and in her favor.
[1629.99] [Music]
[1634.60] Amma, does Baba have any objection to her friendship with boys?
[1640.64] I mean, can't boys and girls be
[1645.00] friends? Now look,
[1649.48] Zaid and Zoya are also very good friends. No
[1657.48] son, there is nothing wrong in this.
[1660.60] Friendship is a good thing. But today
[1665.88] 's children take wrong advantage of this
[1671.92] and do something that is strictly prohibited in our religion.
[1681.68] And if they don't do this, then son, there is nothing
[1686.68] wrong in it.
[1688.36] But our religion, our
[1693.12] Mushaara, does not give a woman a free hand. A woman
[1698.00] should stay within her limits. And anyway, son,
[1702.48] everything looks good only within limits. So,
[1705.76] it means that
[1708.64] all restrictions are for girls.
[1711.92] No, no, not like that.  It's not the point,
[1714.80] boys should also stay within their limits,
[1719.04] rather I say that there should be legitimate restrictions on boys as well,
[1726.20] but this never happens,
[1730.24] Amma,
[1732.00] yes, you have said the right thing, but
[1736.64] son, the girls in our house are
[1739.88] very delicate,
[1744.64] son,
[1747.08] remember that girls should
[1749.20] take every step with care because
[1754.48] many people have an evil eye on them,
[1758.24] yes,
[1760.16] and if the girl does not take a single wrong step,
[1763.64] her parents would lower their eyes out of shame,
[1771.76] Amma, but Baba could have explained to Noshin with love also, yes,
[1781.56] but at many places, parents have to be strict as well,
[1789.40] that is what is for the betterment of the children,
[1796.16] well, leave these things,
[1799.16] Aima,
[1801.12] Aima, come with me,
[1806.48] where are you, Walekum Assalam, son, we both are
[1809.88] going, we will be back, get up, Aima, yes,
[1812.92] I will quickly, Aima, son
[1815.52] [Sangeet]
[1818.64] Wait, Aima, I can go to the mall, but why, what work do I have to get done,
[1828.64] son, don't insist, please let me go,
[1831.52] it's been a whole week since we three
[1833.52] sat together, okay son, she will go again some day,
[1837.52] you can't say anything,
[1840.44] not from Po, Zaid, today  Let it be, Amma has
[1844.68] some work with me
[1847.44] [Praise]
[1853.99] [Praise]
[1855.84] [Music]
[1867.60] Where are Nausheen and Zaid missing, why didn't they come to the dining table?
[1870.00] Nausheen is in your room, did
[1873.12] you not inform her that the food is served, I was not
[1875.32] hungry, you should have told her
[1878.96] that I need everyone's presence, I had
[1881.72] told her but she didn't listen to me,
[1888.60] go and tell her, if she thinks
[1891.52] that I will return her phone and
[1894.00] change my decision, then this is her
[1899.36] misunderstanding and where did Zaid sahab go, he did
[1902.92] n't inform me, you should keep an eye on me,
[1906.56] you are a mother, Baba, that Zaid, your children are
[1909.84] not milk-drinking babies who can't be left alone even for a moment,
[1911.88] children of any
[1913.80] age have to be kept under observation, what do
[1916.00] you want to prove to the parents, if I
[1918.92] am an irresponsible mother, then you should have gotten
[1921.32] married again, why did you live, can you talk politely, can you
[1925.16] not,
[1927.72] answer whatever is said to you, is this a home or a court, keep
[1930.68] standing in the dock all the time, keep answering,
[1936.08] brother, brother, Zaid has gone towards Zoya, yes, then you
[1940.60] couldn't have told me earlier  I kept sitting quietly with a dumpling in my mouth I should have
[1942.92] told you earlier
