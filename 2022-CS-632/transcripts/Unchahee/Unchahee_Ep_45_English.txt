From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you Who is calling you this late? Faiq, it's mama. Is this the time to call? Faiq, she is my mama. She worries
about me that's why she is calling. Nosheen I know what you are going through. Really? You must be really happy then. Why do you always think
that I'm your enemy? Because I know very well
whatever you are doing with me. I am not stupid. We have the contract ready with us. We'll
just have to print your name on it. What else. Sure just get the contract, I will sign it. You didn't let me down, son. And this means a lot to me. I'm talking about Aima. I can tell by looking 
at the joy on her face that you listened to
me and treated her well. Oh, wow, that's an achievement. So, when are you throwing a party? Come on, Sania, since when
have you been so formal? Of course, tell me when would you
want to meet. I can come even now. What difference does it make? And it's not like one doesn't have
any desires after getting married. Besides, I really like
flirting with pretty girls. All right then, we're
meeting at lunch tomorrow. Okay, hold on. Mom and me were waiting 
for you over dinner. Okay, you guys start, I'll join you. Ya, hello? No, nothing I just don't feel
like eating right now. I'll go in a while. Tell me what were we talking about? Yeah, so it's done. I'll be there. Done for sure, tomorrow afternoon. Okay. I told you. Sure, don't worry, I'll manage. Just tell me the date and time. 
I'll be there. No, I won't be late. I'll reach on time. Yeah, okay. Perfect. Okay, bye. Oh, I, I'm good, how about you? I'm perfectly fine. I landed yesterday evening, 
my flight was yesterday. Okay, you came yesterday? Yeah. Actually, I was too tired 
so I couldn't come yesterday. No, it's okay. Good that you took rest. What else? How was 
the weather there, how was your trip? Well, the weather was good, it's just that it started raining 
on the last day so our flight was canceled. So... otherwise you know I... -You're busy.
-No, I was just texting something important, just give me a minute. Zoya, by the way, did you see this? What's in there? There is a shawl and a
perfume which I liked a lot. I really liked the fragrance so I
thought why not take it for Zoya. I'm sorry it's not a big brand, 
but I hope you like it. Thank you, just keep it here somewhere. You know I don't use cheap perfumes. Give it to Aima, she uses them. Zoya, let's go home. -Right now?
-Of course, I have come to pick you up. Sorry, but I can't come with you right now. What do you mean? I have a meeting today. I'll come tomorrow, Zaid. May I know what meeting is it? Oh, yeah, I forgot to tell you. I have signed a contract with an agency. What kind of a contract? A modeling contract. I'll have to work for them for two years. It was a good deal so I
couldn't say no to them. But the contract is really good. What's wrong? Aren't you happy? No, good for you, congratulations. Thanks. I'll come tomorrow, Zain. Okay, then I'll leave. Have a cup of coffee, now that you're here. No, thank you, I don't feel like it. Listen, I forgot to discuss 
the main thing with you. I think you must have decided by
now who do you want to live  with. What do you mean? Look, Zaid, it's very simple. Just tell me who do you want
in your life. Aima or me? And if you can't leave Aima 
then you should divorce me. Because I can't handle
this tug of war anymore. Really? Oh, my God. Stop it Faiq,
I am having a laughing fit here. You look nice when you smile. Okay, now that's a compliment. I have heard that girls like compliments. Yeah, right actually. But I am not such a girl who gets
happy by listening to a compliment. Yes, but who doesn't like to be praised? That's also correct. I know, I'm always right. Oh, please, well it's not like that. It is like that, Sania. Well one must ask this question to
your wife. She must know the right answer. I fell that every husband 
has two personalities. Really? How come? One which is his actual one, and the other
that he pretends to be in front of his wife. OMG, that's so mean! -That's a fact.
-I just don't get one thing. What's that? Why can't you guys stay like
how you are in front of your wives? To tell you the truth,
you are quite comic yourself. -Shut up, Faiq.
-No, I'm serious. If you will say this in front of
any guy he is going to laugh. You guys are so culprit. Come on, we men are the most
innocent creatures of this world. Yeah, sure, do we have any
other option than believing on it? We didn't even order anything
because of your chattering. We'll grab something on our way back. So now you will blame 
even that on us girls? By the way, shall
I say something? Sure go ahead, say it if
there is anything else left to say. -No, seriously.
-Okay, go ahead. Sania, with you time passes so quickly. -And you know what the beauty is?
-What? -The time passes really well too.
-God, you have become so flirtatious. Excuse me, what do you mean I have become?
I was always like that. Yes, I am aware of that. But don't
forget that now you are a married man. Well, this is an
unforgettable incident, Sania. Come on, let's walk. What can I tell you, Shabana, my innocent
daughter is facing so much cruelty there. I just can't believe that Faiq
and sister Nimra can do all this. Do you think I'm lying then? No, if you are saying it 
then it must be true. Just have courage, don't cry. How can I not cry, Shabana? We have been so unfortunate. I am dying to see my children happy. I don't know whose evil eyes 
have caught my children that they never have any happiness and
if they do they aren't beneficial for them. May God make it better for them. He will create ease. That's true. But I thought
you could help me. After all she is your
sister in law, Shabana. For God's sake, tell them to
have some mercy on my daughter. Yes, of course sister, now
that you have talked to me I will talk to sister
Nimra about it for sure. And if necessary I will talk to Faiq too. Yes, please talk to them and tel them. Otherwise I could have
set them straight myself, but we just suffer because
we are noble people. People try to control
their son in laws first, so that they can get the whole
family dance to their tune. But we don't know how to be so shrewd. My elder son isn't with me
anymore, and Zaid isn't happy either. And now Nosheen isn't able 
to sustain her household either. Tell me honestly, Shabana, you must
be laughing on my misfortune in your mind and you must be
celebrating my helplessness. Because one doesn't get
as sad on one's own misery than one gets happy on others' pain. It isn't like that at all. Neither have I ever considered you as my
enemy, nor I ever celebrate anybody's pain. No, I didn't mean it like that. 
You took it wrong, Shabana. Obviously, you said something like that. Shabana, I am a human too. It
just slips out of my mouth at times. Now look, you have such ease in your life. You are leading a life with so much luxury. And apparently I have got
everything but  even then I really don't know what you think of as ease and luxury. But I am just happy. and content too on
whatever God has given me. That's nice, but may I say something? Your Aima's family is so weird. May be she could have coped with Faiq. That's the reality. Because
my Nosheen isn't that sharp. Don't know how she got in between
Faiq and Aima, my poor Nosheen. Well, she took this decision herself. And she shouldn't regret it now. Of course, now you are
going to hit me with taunts, because I have asked you something to do. Anyway, will you talk to them about
Nosheen and tell them not to do it? Sure, as soon as I get a
chance I will go to their place. Just don't worry, 
God will make things better. I think you must have decided by
now who do you want to live  with. What do you mean? Look, Zaid, it's very simple. Just tell me who do you want
in your life. Aima or me? And if you can't leave Aima 
then you should divorce me. Because I can't handle
this tug of war anymore. -Dad.
-Oh, thank you. Were you busy? No, I'm not busy at all, what is it? Good. We are extending our business, and I am happy about the fact that
you and Zaid are supporting me in it. -I am proud on you both.
-Thank you, Dad. I want you both to get regular now. Not just one or two projects but deal
with overall business matters now. What do you say? Dad, it's a huge responsibility. But still if you think that we are able
to do it then I have no issues with it. But still we will need your guidance. -I am always there to guide you both.
-That's true. If you ask me, I am completely
satisfied from your side. But with Zaid, I think he will take
a little time in completing things. In taking over complete responsibility. Zaid is still not able to
adjust his matters properly. -What do you think?
-About what, Dad? That he is still not happy. He stays a little disturbed. What can I say? Maybe you're right. I know it's easier said than
done in such a situation. But still... I know one thing, you are his good friend 
and now his wife too. Remember, if he finds peace with you he will be able to solve all his
problems and get out of them. He will get rid of his tensions because
you are a wise and a loving wife. You are no less than a blessing for a man. I think you get what I mean. Yes, Dad, I will try my best. I am sure that you will prove
to be the best wife for Zaid. And with time Zaid will
realise this fact too. You'll see. Actually, these are official matters. I wanted to get it done
in front of you both but you both didn't come for lunch. 
I thought you both might have some plans. No, Dad, we had no plans. Really? I thought you
both must be together. He has gone to get Zoya. But he is back home. 
It's been long since he returned. -Don't you know?
-No. Zoya didn't return with him. 
Didn't he tell you anything? No, I haven't talked to Zaid yet. I have a feeling that he 
is worried because of Zoya. Anyway, go ask him if
he even had lunch or not. And please, if you think it's
appropriate ask him about Zoya too. What are you thinking, Aima? Nothing. Dear, if he is worried about something then it's your duty to help
him out of that problem. Do I have to tell you both again and again that you both have rights
and duties on each other. You will have to understand that. Yes, Dad. -Where is your tea?
-I don't want to drink. You drink yours. Okay. Have you lost your mind? Why do you keep calling and messaging me? I am at my in laws, 
and I am a married woman. And listen to me carefully, I don't
have any sympathy for you now. And as much as you have suffered, 
I wish you would suffer even more than that. Nosheen, just believe me, dear. Don't you dare call me dear. 
I am not dear to you anymore. And listen, I am not going
to get trapped by you now. My life is ruined because of you. I want to make everything right, 
just believe me. Oh, come on. As if you can make them right. And listen to me carefully, now only call me when you have
to return my money, understood? I will return it all. I promise you I am
going to return each and every penny. That's a promise. Just believe me once. Hello, Nosheen. Did you come to say something
or are you spying on me? I just came to tell that Shabana is coming. -Auntie?
-Yes. And I am going to the market
to get some stuff with the driver. Just go to the kitchen. I have put the rice
to steam, turn off the stove in 7 minutes. And the milk is on the stove too
for boiling. Just keep an eye on it. -Okay, fine.
-I'll be back in a while. Okay. What happened, you... Your hand was hanging down 
so I was putting it up. You didn't even take off 
your shoes and slept. It's 5:30 already. Been so much
time and I didn't even know it. Dad was telling me that you didn't
eat anything, did you have lunch there? -No.
-Why not? Why didn't you have lunch at home? Just like that, I didn't feel like it. Is there any problem? But didn't you go to get Zoya? Didn't she come with you? No. Did you both had a fight again? Aima please, can we
talk about something else? Sure, but first eat something. 
It's too late. -I don't want to eat right now.
-But why? Please, I'm not hungry. How can it be? You just had a
couple of slices of bread since morning. Aima, please, don't bother me. Okay then I won't eat either. What do you mean? Why didn't you eat? I didn't feel like it, 
but now I feel hungry. Then eat it now. Okay, listen, I'll just freshen up,
then we will eat together. All right. Your phone has been ringing for so long. Why don't you keep it with you? You should have left it there. 
When did I ask you to get it? It was ringing continuously
near me that's why I got it. By the way, who is this lady? -Excuse me?
-Why? I'm just asking who is she? Why are you asking? And what would you do by knowing it? What do you mean why am I asking?
I am your wife. Well then stay like a wife. No need to guard me, understood. I get several calls in a day, I can't
submit the call record of every call I get. The one you feel guilty about, usually
you aren't able to tell about them only. Well you may think like that. Now please,
go from here and let me stay in peace. Zoya, if you were coming
you should have told me,  I would have come
to pick you up myself. Actually I had no plans, but I got in
the mood early morning so I came. Besides the driver dropped me.
And I haven't got my stuff either. I thought you must be waiting for me. But I think I was mistaken. By looking at you it seems as if
you were waiting for me to leave that when I am going to leave
and when you can live without fear... Why are you doing this, Zoya? You are assuming everything yourself. Like what? Like, why do you think 
that I didn't miss you? I missed you God dammit. That's why
I came to pick you as soon as I landed. Not as soon as you landed,
you came to pick me the next day. Anyway, I believe what you
are saying like I always do. It doesn't seem like you
missed me by looking at you. Why are you being so bitter? Oh, am I hurting you Zaid? I'm so sorry. I didn't meant to. I'm already too stressed, Zoya. Will you just stop being sarcastic? Can't we sit and talk like normal people? Really? Is everything
normal like it used to be? It's only things like these
that you say which hurt me. Of course it's only
what I say that hurts you. That's why you go to Aima to vent out. It's nothing like that, Zoya. Having a good time? Don't you lie to me, Zaid. And I'm sorry I ruined
your moment with her. It seemed as if you are on a honeymoon
flight and I have come like bad weather. You think I was lying? When did I say that? Zoya if you have even a little doubt,
you may inquire at the airline office. Right, like this is the only thing
I have to do to keep inquiring. Leave Aima and your dad's house. Zaid, I will talk to mom, she will arrange
for your job and house, everything. Are you serious, Zoya? What
the hell are you talking about? I am saying all this to you because be this girl quarrelsome,
ill-mannered or unskilled, you will have to spend
your life with her now. I don't know how am I going to spend it. Wow, what a way to explain your son. I am really impressed. Everyone should have
a mother in law like you. You are fueling up your
son and then telling him that he will have to
spend his life with me? If I slit your throat and then
say sorry, would it be okay? Zaid you loved my
daughter so much, didn't you? You married her and took her from
here, with so much begging, pride and love. What have you done then? Why did you do this to my daughter?
