From flowers and from buds I have learnt to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you Well then to prove your friendship, 
give me a favor. What kind of favor? I am going to leave for the
farm house in a little while. Just stay for a little longer. Faisal, don't be silly. Dad, often wakes
up for early morning prayers, just go now. If you could just stay for a little longer. Mind you language, she is my mother. Really? The thief scolding the police? I am well aware of the plan you and
your mother had made to get me caught. Look, you are misunderstanding me. And secondly, my mother is your aunt.
You have got a blood relation with her. To hell with such blood 
and such a relation. I can trust any random person walking
on the street, but not you both. Thankless people.
Biting the hands that feed you. Enough, Nosheen. Get out from here. You are the one 
who is going to get out from here.  I won't go anywhere, this is my house. Until I am under the shelter of dad, 
this is my house too. Fine, stay here, 
until I am going to let you stay here. You have made a huge mistake
 by messing with me. You are the one who has
committed the mistake. Instead of accepting your mistake
 you are blaming us? Don't you ever judge me. You have humiliated me
in front of my father, I am going to humiliate you
in front of the whole world. Remember that, it's a promise. Whatever has happened
in this house yesterday  isn't worth it to get discussed
again in front of anyone. That's why I have made some decisions. And that's why I have called both of you. Why don't you eat something, you
haven't eaten anything since morning. -You don't need to worry about me.
-Azmat you... I went to get her admission
canceled from her college.  She won't be going from tomorrow. -Yes but...
-Don't interrupt me. She is not going to use any phone. Dad, Dad just listen to me. She is not allowed to go anywhere. Neither anyone is going to come here,
nor she is going to go anywhere. Meeting friends all these excuses
and pretense must end now. If there is something really
important then the person should meet her here
at home in presence of everyone. If you both have any questions you can ask.  Look I admit that she is at fault, but... No ifs and but. If she has committed a mistake
 she must be punished for it. Dad, Dad I'm sorry,
 please just give me a last chance... I have given you that chance last time. You have lost all your
chances to get excused don't expect any
relaxation from me now. Dad, without a phone,
without going to college, how am I supposed to spend
my time staying at home? Don't worry, you won't be spending 
much time in this house. Meaning? I mean that she should be get
married as soon as possible. But I don't want to get
married right now, Dad. I haven't asked for your opinion,
 I have told you my decision. You can't do it, Dad. Marrying someone with my own will is my
right and it's your responsibility... I just stopped myself before hitting you
today, don't you dare say that again. Or else I won't stop then, understood? What are you doing, Mother? 
I told you to rest. Brother is here, I thought
of making tea for him. You should have told me, Mother, 
I could have made it. Oh, it's all right. You both must be relieved 
after seeing my daughter like this. I don't want to talk to
you on this issue at all. Of course you won't want to talk about it,
because your planning has been so perfect. There was no planning. Really? How was your timing so perfect?
Could you please tell me? You won't believe me 
no matter what I tell you. Those who are guilty 
at heart always say that. Auntie, please stop now, 
you know mother is not well. Does she gets worse by listening the truth? What do you want, auntie, 
why are you behaving like this with us? Do you want to know what I want? I want peace in this house 
which I can't get while you both are here. So, tell me, can you do that? It just saddens me. Had we obliged some
stranger so much, he would have been thankful
to us all his life. And then there are you two, always
keep planning against my daughter, -keep conspiring against her.
-Sister... You are accusing us. I would never want 
anything bad for Nosheen. And whatever she does, 
she would remain my niece. You are a liar. You are jealous. You weren't able to give Aima 
what I have given to Nosheen. I decided the day I
showed you the diamond set that you are going to harm Nosheen. Auntie, please, stop it now,
 or else I am going to involve dad. Don't you dare threaten me. I am not
afraid of anyone in this house, got it? You've taken away 
the happiness of other's daughters. Despite of having a young
daughter yourself. Now go and show your crocodile
tears to your brother. Let's go from here, mother. Let's go. Have some water please, Mother. Please stop crying. Mother, don't take the bitter things 
that auntie says seriously. For that I will have to get
really, really insensitive. Look, you know 
how she is since the beginning. She is just like that. Whatever good we do to her, 
she is never going to get happy. You are right. She is one of those, who never get happy, 
no matter what you do for them. Mother, if you now that then... why do you cry? I listen to everything she says. Stay quiet. I tolerate it. I have never argued with her. But don't know why, I get really sad at times. I can't stop my tears even if I want. One should cry sometimes to feel relieved. But now, I think, whatever is happening with me, don't know if it's God's test or curse? Yes, Mother, it's a test. Just like father's death was a test for us. Yes I comfort myself just by thinking that, that behind everything God does, there is some expedience. -Like?
-Like, you not getting married to Hammad. If you had gotten married to Hammad, sister and Nosheen would have
given you a lot of trouble. They would have never let you stay happy. I just, I just pray only one thing to God, that you get a really good proposal, and you go away from here, far away. So far away, that they don't
even think about you. Please don't cry, Mother. Oh, God. Zaid... -Sorry, Dad. I didn't see you, greetings.
-Greetings. -Where have you been since morning?
- At the university. Then I had a plan with some friends, 
so got a little late. I don't know when are you going 
to grow up, get responsible. -I don't understand.
-That is your problem. You just don't want to understand anything. Dad, just tell me, has something happened? You mean to say that when you return
home after having fun all day then I should brief you about everything What happened what didn't happen all day? -No, Dad, you are taking me wrong.
-Oh, so I am the one who is wrong? No, Dad, I just want 
to ask what the issue is? It's your responsibility to take care
 of the matters at home yourself. The day you are going to take interest
in the issues regarding your family, you are going to get
aware of them yourself. I don't know till when are you
going to live a duke's life. You have got no time. You know that your
elder brother has left after deceiving us. Dear you have to get married eventually. And the sooner it happens the better it is. Get Zoya married then? Why did I become unwanted {\an8}Nobody knows that Why did I become unwanted {\an8}Nobody knows that Have you ever asked Nosheen, where she
goes, when she goes and why she goes? You don't have time 
for anything else than yourself. You are going to get married tomorrow, how all of this is going to run, how
are you going to manage all this? Think sensibly. Or you won't have anything
left than regret. Good night. Such a big issue happened here 
and you didn't even tell me? I was about to tell you, Zaid, but... What do you mean by, 
"about to tell", Aima? I asked you so may time 
to tell me if there is a problem? This is not a small thing.  Aima, there aren't any secrets between us. You should have told me whatever it was. Do you know how much dad has scolded me? I was digesting one taunt 
and he was ready with another. Spoiled all my good mood. 
All because of you. Zaid, you were going to
the university then, I didn't want to spoil
your mood at that time. I wouldn't have gotten mad
with anger after knowing it, but at least I should know
what is going on in the house. You know, Dad's anger is valid this way. My sister stays out of the house
at night and I am not even aware of it. I thought of telling you everything 
before dad comes back. Why aren't you trying 
to understand me, Zaid? I couldn't have told you about Nosheen. But why? Because... because she
made me her confidante. -What?
-I didn't tell you because of that. Because she had asked for a favor
 in the name of friendship. I have been up all night 
because of Nosheen. And then mother got sick.
 I have been up all night. I'm sorry Aima, but I think you 
are responsible for all this as well. What? Because you helped her
getting out of the house. Zaid, I warned her that
what she is doing is wrong. You are two years elder than her. What do you mean warned her? 
You should have stopped her. And if she hadn't agreed
you should have told me. And what about the friendship 
that dad asked me to have with her? Her safety is most important. And just imagine if anything
had happened to her there would have been such a big issue. Zaid, I got really confused. I was
really scared. Didn't know what to do. Aima, we are supposed to be best friends. Please share with me whatever it is, okay? You just go to sleep, 
I'll take care of aunt. Oh, come on sister, at the end of the
day if you have to get her married then why don't you talk to the family
of that guy whom Nosheen is interested in. I don't know, 
Azmat is just going to strangle me. What is wrong with it? I don't know about all this,
 just do one thing for me, I just want you to find a really
good proposal for Nosheen, before her dad gets her married 
to any random person, Amber. Okay, fine, sister, I'll look for a nice proposal, 
a  good option for Nosheen. I just don't want that my daughter has to live
with restrictions even after getting married. As I said, I will try my best to find 
a good proposal for Nosheen. After all there is nothing 
that Nosheen lacks. Yes, please do this for me 
as soon as you can. You don't need to,
 I don't want to get married. Nosheen, what is this nonsense? Dear, you will have to
get married eventually, and thee sooner it is done the better. Get Zoya married then. And you, don't start discussing your
personal issues with every other person. Stop is , Nosheen. Go from here. 
I said, just go, just go. Sorry, Amber, she has lost her mind
since yesterday, please don't mind. I just pray one thing to God, 
that you get a nice proposal, and then you go away from here. Do you like me or not? It's just you... that I like. -Really?
-Yes. -Why?
-Because... You are a very... stubborn, someone who gets easily angry
 and an idiot friend of mine. Here are photos of some guys,
 and no excuse will work this time. Mom, let me just take a look today. I should know who those unfortunate
people are who want to get married to me. -What is this, Mom?
-What do you mean what is this, it' a boy. Just look at him, seems like he has
sent picture to audition for modeling. Well, that's nice then, it's
going to be a nice pair. Please, Mom. Okay, look at this one. What are you doing? This... this, why have you set up
 this flee market of boys. -You have so many issues.
-Okay, okay, I'll take a look. Reject... Reject... Reject... Zoya,you just took a
look and rejected them? Mom, I have got eyes, and I can see. Okay, forget it, show me
some more samples.... I mean show me more boys. Just leave it, you don't
want to look at them, you are just doing this to please me. Mom, it's not like that. Yes,  am marrying so that you get happy, but it's okay, show me more guys, okay? This one seems better. Thank God, at least you liked someone. Mom, they both are better. Yes, but this, look at this one, 
isn't this one nice? -He is from media, and I think he is a director.
-So? Well so, you can follow
your passion this way. Mom, Zoya doesn't want
 to use anyone's reference. And please, don't get too happy, 
I am just looking at these pictures, I haven't said, " I agree" thrice yet.
(haven't been married to them yet.) Well, " I agree" starts 
from here, isn't it? I'll do one thing, get details 
of these three boys, and let you know. Mom, you don't need
 to get information from anyone. Do you know what their names are? I have no issues 
with someone marrying of their own choice. I have an issue with that girl's choice. That guy is a scumbag. Why did I become unwanted {\an8}Nobody knows that Why did I become unwanted {\an8}Nobody knows that Yeah, it's written here, Azam Shah. Azam Shah. You just wait, let me get information 
about him in just two seconds. Mom, he doesn't even know
 how to take a selfie. What the hell are you doing? And he is a doctor as well, hmm. -So what?
-And he is an engineer too? Mom, he has shared such a cheap post. And the pages he has liked, 
I won't even look at them. He is such a sad soul. Zoya, what is this nonsense 
what are you looking at? Mom, this information is accurate. Because if you ask the match makers, they present the guys as angels. Mom, he has had a break up four months ago. Poor guy. Thank you so much, 
you provided entertainment in my life. Where is the other picture? Zoya... -At least, leave one, just one.
-Forget it, just leave it. Come on. Nosheen, what are you doing? I feel really low. If I hadn't drink it, I would have fainted. I had made it for mother, 
so that her BP remains normal. So what? I just told you 
my BP is really low too. Nosheen, you could have made it
 for yourself too. I have become sick like aunt
 by staying in this house. If I hadn't drink it I would have fainted. And there is no one 
who cares for me so much. That if I faint, he would pick me up 
and take me to the hospital. By the way, hadn't I been sick, 
I would have made it better than this. What are you trying to prove with all this? That the days when I used to go 
to college were better for you. It was your own fault, that doesn't mean at all that you
take out all your anger on me. Listen, make another glass
 of juice for aunt. She won't drink from what I have left. And there is a lot to drink
and eat in this house, for those who belong here and
for those too who are outsiders. And there is a juicer as well. And you can use electrical appliances too,
because the bill has been paid by dad. I don't know how can you be
 at ease after doing all this? You are so innocent, Aima. You started
crying on such a petty thing? Nosheen has just started right now. It's not that bad. Listen, don't go to sleep, I have
asked them to make tea for you. Wake me up when it's here. -Listen.
-Hmm? I know you are really angry at Nosheen. but why don't you consider 
that she is so young. Listen to one thing carefully, I am not
going to forgive that girl at all. Tell me, do you actually want
 to get her married? Why? What do you think, am I joking? I thought that you said it 
just to scare her. Had she one of those who get scared, she would have corrected herself
after the first time I excused her. Look, what I'm going to say now, 
just listen to it with a cool mind. Look, it's the fast age. Till when are we going 
to look away from all that. Girls and boys these days
 are very independent. Come to the point, Almas. I was just saying that,
what if we call and meet the parents of that guy
whom Nosheen meets? That's out of the question! Just think about it with a cool mind. I am thinking, but I think
you have lost your mind. Azmat if we have to fix her marriage,
why not fix it where she wants? I have no issues if one
marries with one's choice. I have issue with that girl's choice. That guy is a scum bag. Azmat, How can you say that 
without even meeting or seeing anyone? I have seen the world. Guys who want to marry girls, They marry them in an honorable way,
they send a formal proposal for them. They don't roam around with them
in the middle of the night. The relationship which begins with a lie, that relationship can never
be successful, understand? He is a worthless guy. Don't know where he took my daughter
in the middle of the night, by lying to her, tempting her. And you want me 
to make that guy my son-in-law? I won't hire such a guy 
as a petty worker in my company. Such a loafer. What are you thinking now? I was thinking that Nosheen
wouldn't agree that easily. What kind of a mother are you? Why don't you tell your daughter
what is better for her? Her studies have also been interrupted. Fine, put the blame of that on me too. Look, it's better to get Nosheen
married as soon as possible. Before she shines our name even brighter. Like your eldest son. -Aima, look here.
-Hmm? Which one? - None.
-Man... Zaid, you are going to say,
"Aima, choose a shirt." Then I'll tell you, " Wear this one." Then you'll say,
"Aima please iron it for me." Seems like I have 
to think of some other trick. Please, Zaid, go, I have 
a lot of work to do, just don't bother me. Aima, you know well that I only like 
to wear clothes that are ironed by you. Even dry cleaners are nothing
in front of you. Please do it. You know, it starts tasting
bad when you butter too much. Okay, do it just today, for the last time. It's a special day today. I'm going on a date 
with your would be sister-in-law. What? Didn't Zoya tell you? By the way, tell me one thing, honestly. Don't you like Kinza either?  No. Well I thought you won't because 
Zoya doesn't like her that much. And whenever I mention her, 
why do you make a long face? No... it's nothing like that. Neither I like her, nor I find her bad. That's a very politically correct statement. Okay then at least tell me
how do we both look together? Yeah, fine. Aima, tell me in detail, what is this? Zaid, what should I say? Okay tell me, how do you find 
our chemistry, you know, as a couple? I am asking you because those who are 
in love, everything seems perfect to them. So, at times it's important 
to take an outsider's opinion. Outsider? I mean the love circle between me
and Kinza, you are out of that. That's why, outsider. -Okay.
-What Okay? Give me you opinion
I am asking you seriously. Zaid, do whatever you feel like doing. Oh, it's all the matter 
of this stupid heart. Zaid, go now, stop this drama. This isn't drama, dear. If you had fallen in love with someone 
you would know what love is. It makes a person blind, completely blind. Ask how? -Hmm, how?
-Let me tell you, wait. Like that. Why did I become unwanted {\an8}Nobody knows that Why did I become unwanted {\an8}Nobody knows that I just don't understand 
what Zaid saw in Kinza. Was she the only one to fall
 in love with? I detest her. Don't know what she saw in her. Zoya, I can't say
anything about this. You are allowing the proposals
coming through dad too and you have asked auntie 
for my proposals as well. Zaid... I like you. I really like you.
