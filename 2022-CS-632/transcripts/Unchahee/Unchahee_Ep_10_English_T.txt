[0.15] From flowers and from buds
[4.43] I have learnt to bloom and be fragrant
[9.27] When I saw you
[14.37] I learned how to chirp from you
[19.16] I have an idea that Almas and Nosheen
have adopted an unfair behaviour with you.
[27.36] Is that true?
[29.10] Your dear aunt, poisons
your dad's ears against me.
[37.15] No, no, I haven't talked 
to brother about it at all.
[42.25] If you hadn't said anything,
[44.14] Azmat wouldn't have rebuked me
so much without any reason.
[47.66] The world might feel pity
on your miserable face.
[51.08] But don't you dare show your
cunningness in front of me.
[58.98] Come , come in.
[61.05] Relax, no issues. Come in.
[66.88] -Aima, I'm telling you...
-Stay where you are. Stay there.
[70.83] Don't you dare come near me, or else...
[73.31] Look, I am not going to harm you at all,
you don't need to worry, just relax.
[78.66] Just give me my data, I've got no time.
[81.86] I will give it to you, 
first come inside the room.
[85.68] Don't you dare...
whatever you need to say, say it here.
[88.60] -Dude, you...
-I ain't your dude!
[90.78] Look, this is my friend's place 
and it is empty most of the times.
[95.34] If the neighbors listen to us they
will get suspicious for no reason.
[98.67] That's not my problem.
[100.38] Get me my pictures right now.
[102.75] Aima, you are completely safe here.
[105.21] Give me my pictures
 and leave me alone then.
[108.43] All right, wait.
[129.13] What are you doing?
[133.65] Put it back. Put it back.
[144.20] -Have some water.
-I don't want to, move...
[147.86] What did you do? I said I
don't want to drink water! Move away.
[152.34] Don't you dare touch me,
scoundrel, shameless guy!
[156.50] I was just helping you.
[159.71] I don't want your help. 
Don't you dare touch me.
[165.01] Bring my pictures,
[166.25] and all the data that you have,
bring it to me, let me leave then.
[171.17] Look, Aima, I can't make you understand
anything standing like this.
[174.81]  Please, sit down.
[181.18] Okay, as you wish.
[185.80] Don't you have any manners?
[189.38] -Oh, sorry I forgot to ask. 
-Move it away, I am allergic to smoke.
[194.41] Okay, there you go, happy?
[197.81] You... tell me honestly,
 who has asked you to do all this?
[204.69] And from where did you get 
all these pictures of me?
[207.88] Aima, all the pictures that I have 
of yours are edited by me.
[215.07] All of them are fake, edited.
[218.09] Besides, I am not going 
to send your pictures to anyone.
[220.92] I don't have the contact 
of any of your family member.
[224.44] Delete them in front of me. Right now.
[227.03] I am telling you 
that I am going to delete them.
[228.81] You did as I said,
now I'll do as you say.
[231.14] I said, delete all the pictures
in front of me right now.
[235.18] Okay.
[237.41] Here, delete them yourself. Go ahead.
[242.41] Delete them.
[243.83] And yes, delete the
pictures from "deleted items" too
[247.30]  or else they will remain there.
[252.26] Take your time, no worries.
[257.61] All done? Happy now? It was just that.
[262.43] Look, Aima, I called you here just because
I can say what I wanted to say to you.
[274.55] I love you, Aima.
[280.50] Honor less man.
[282.30] If you'll even try to contact me again,
[286.40] then I am going to involve the police.
Understood? Cheapster.
[290.70] Hey, listen, Aima, Aima!
[298.31] At least you could have listened to me.
[312.17] One has to do all sorts of
things for money. Let's go.
[320.31] Oh, God! You went alone?
[324.14] Talk slowly, someone might listen.
[327.55] I didn't know what to do, Zoya,
that's why I went alone.
[333.20] And those pictures?
[334.79] Everything was fake, he told me himself
that he edited those pictures.
[345.93] What was the point of doing all this then?
[349.19] Trapping girls by telling
them he loves them.
[355.16] He was saying that he loves me, 
I slapped him real hard after that.
[361.09] I don't get it. Why would someone
do like this if he is in love?
[366.21] Just forget it now. 
I don't want to discuss it anymore.
[370.68] We won't talk about this issue again.
[372.85] Not yet, first Zaid is
going to investigate you,
[376.26] where did you go, why did you
go, with whom did you go?
[379.65] You know how sentimental he is.
[384.37] I know you guys 
are hiding something from me.
[387.08] I am observing everything, 
fine don't tell me anything.
[391.49] I just don't get what Zaid's problem is.
[394.80] Where ever I go I should tell this mister.
As if he is my father.
[401.43] But my mind is stuck on
just one thing that...
[406.14] He didn't do anything to you, did he?
[409.02] He was trying to, and he was finding
excuses to get closer to me.
[413.40] That's why I slapped him.
[417.08] But you shouldn't have
gone there all alone.
[420.20] -I know.
-Anyway,
[423.21] you know, Zaid has got gifts
for Kinza worth 20,000/-
[428.05] He only stopped when I asked him to.
[431.46] He is just in a relationship now,
[434.98] if they get committed, I don't know
what that girl would do to him.
[439.17] Thank God he didn't transfer 
the house and his car etc. in her name.
[443.29] I find her quite ordinary.
[452.67] Aima,
[455.96] -why don't you say anything?
-What can I say, Zoya?
[459.96] If Zaid likes her then she must
be extra-ordinary for him.
[464.65] You and your philosophies.
[473.23] Yes, Mama?
[475.83] Yes, I'll be back in a while.
[479.54] Fine, okay, bye.
[486.76] Thank you, thanks a lot.
[493.65] Zoya, you didn't greet your uncle.
[496.62] Oh, hello, I'm so sorry.
[499.95] -How are you, uncle?
-Fine, thank you.
[503.01] How are you doing, and how are studies?
[505.61] It's fine, but not like Aima.
[510.53] Why is that?
[519.19] Sorry, were you asking something?
I got distracted by this message.
[524.75] I was asking that...
[528.76] Hello? Yes, I'm on my way.
[533.74] Shall I send it when I reach home? Okay.
[537.76] Sorry, guys, I have to go.
 I have some work to do, okay?
[541.93] So, I'll see you soon. Okay, bye.
[557.36] There is something 
that I have noticed about Zoya.
[562.23] And what is that?
[563.33] She has the same carelessness and
thoughtlessness like Nosheen,
[566.08]  which is dislike so much.
[567.63] You have never liked any girl other than...
[570.78] You just start fighting without reason.
[572.93] Try to understand what I am saying.
[575.33] You should have asked the
reason why I am saying it.
[578.12] The reason is quite clear.
[580.19] You have an objection on everyone
who is associated with me.
[584.29] I am not saying anything to Zoya.
[586.72] I am just saying 
that her habits don't suit her.
[590.02] Girls from good families 
don't behave this way.
[592.34] And what are the qualities that suit 
on girls from good families?
[596.55] Poise, respect of elders, consideration.
Our traditional ways.
[602.53] And unfortunately, 
girls these days have none of it.
[606.06] Why don't you say it clearly that you
want every girl to be like Aima, right?
[611.36] And this poise, consideration, politeness,
[614.96] that is just for you by your dear one.
[619.27] Your dear one doesn't consider us at all, 
misbehaves so much with me.
[623.53] You are taking to to another direction,
[625.51]  I was just saying that I don't
like Zoya's habits.
[629.79] Zoya is someone else's daughter,
You don't even like Nosheen.
[634.59] Every person has some
qualities and some drawbacks.
[638.57] Some are full of pretense.
[641.49] They are something else from inside
and something else from outside,
[643.98] and some are like Nosheen
and Zoya, straight forward.
[653.15] Put some sugar in your tea, 
your tone might get a bit sweet.
[662.21] Show me the positive changes
in you through your actions,
[667.76] not just with words.
[670.17] The day you behave actually
like your sisters with Aima,
[674.75] and give Shabana the respect 
that she deserves,
[678.40] you won't have 
to tell me anything that day.
[680.68] Why did I get unwanted
[685.28] Nobody knows that
[689.95] Why did I get unwanted
[694.55] Nobody knows that
[705.81] -Aima.
-Yes, Mother?
[710.81] Aima what is this, where were you gone?
You didn't even tell me.
[715.82] Mother, I told you, I went
for something important.
[719.53] No matter how important it might be,
[723.93] always tell me the details before leaving.
[725.62] Where are you going and with
whom, and when will you return.
[728.36] -You know, Zaid was also worried.
-I'm really sorry.
[734.88] I am going to tell you
next time, happy now?
[741.63] Aima, you made a huge mistake
the other day as well.
[746.73] Complaining about sister,
and Nosheen to brother.
[750.69] What should have I done? Dad was asking me.
[753.99] Yes, he shouldn't have asked it
 if you hadn't talked to Zaid about it.
[760.63] Mother, Zaid and dad should also know 
how their behaviour is with us both?
[767.09] Complaining to brother 
about it isn't the solution to this.
[772.28] If the matter of this house
could be solved this way,
[775.93]  they would have been solved long ago.
[778.87] You don't know, things would get 
even worse this way.
[783.05] By doing that, sister and Nosheen
won't start liking us, would they?
[788.21] Yes, Mother, I made a mistake.
[791.83] I even told Zaid not to tell. Anyway...
[797.34] Besides, dear, we must acknowledge
[801.82] that by keeping us in their house
they have indebted us.
[808.09] No matter how much brother
and Zaid deny it, but that is the truth.
[815.48] And their love for us
can't hide this truth.
[820.32] Yes, Mother, you are absolutely right.
[823.60] Dear, these complains will have
 a bad effect on brother and Zaid.
[831.22] No matter what, sister and Nosheen have
a much closer relationship with them.
[839.24] I don't want that brother doesn't spend
quality time with his family because of us.
[846.41] And Zaid too.
[852.27] I just want that
[855.00] brother thinks good of sister and Nosheen.
[861.10] Yes, Mother.
[863.77] -May I say something?
-Yes?
[866.67] I just don't believe how in the world
can a person can be so positive?
[873.25] But I am proud that
 that positive person is my mother.
[878.33] May God always keeps you happy.
[884.55] Dear, you are my happiness only. 
If you are happy then I am happy.
[892.33] Yes, Mother. I won't let
you complain again.
[898.93] I know that very well.
[901.75] You are not the one
who repeats her mistakes.
[907.63] Dear...
[910.40] as many days you have in this house,
[914.22] spend them with patience.
Tolerate and forgive.
[922.66] God willing, one day
[926.28] God will make a very good, 
a much better arrangement for you.
[932.55] Mother, I always worry
[935.38] about what is going to happen to you
when I go away from this house.
[940.52] Oh...
[944.84] what is going to happened to me, huh?
[948.06] I will keep spending my life 
as I am spending it.
[952.33] Besides, I don't want
anything else from life now.
[957.78] I just want your happiness 
and your peace, dear.
[983.13] Dad, I have made a cake, try it please.
[987.40] That's great. You know I avoid sugar.
[991.44] Dad, it's sugar-free. 
I have made it specially for you.
[995.23] You have made it, it's fine.
Even if it wasn't sugar free
[998.24] I would have eaten it because
my daughter has made it.
[1006.70] It's delicious.
[1008.72] Thank God, you liked it. 
Hard work pays off.
[1014.74] Dad, my I share a problem with you?
[1019.92] Dad, mother gave me your message.
[1023.75] And I try my best that I take care of Aima.
[1028.41] But, Dad, Aima has an issue even over this
that why am I being so thoughtful for her.
[1033.73] You both have been raised in front
of me, under the same roof.
[1036.57] I know both of you very
well, you know your nature?
[1041.09] I haven't spent this life just like that.
[1044.57] I didn't get what you said, Dad.
[1046.86] Make me realize the positive changes
in you through your actions.
[1052.40] Not just with words.
[1054.89] The day your behaviour with Aima
is actually like your sisters,
[1059.50] and give Shabana the respect
 that she deserves,
[1063.13] you won't have 
to tell me anything that day.
[1065.67] I am actually going to be
really happy with you.
[1067.25] Okay, Dad, I will agree to this too.
[1070.82] Because anything I say, 
you don't find it true.
[1075.29] Nor you trust me, and how can you
trust, I have lost it myself.
[1081.45] But, Dad, you over estimate Aima.
[1085.94] I don't get it, what is your point?
[1089.60] Just that, Dad, that you
can see my faults only, not Aima's.
[1094.94] The mistake I did, Aima could
have done it too, Dad.
[1098.54] I know Aima, she would never
do anything like that.
[1103.99] Dad, thats very normal these days,
[1107.57] and I am not saying that in a wrong
way, the society is like that.
[1112.59] Parties etc. are very normal,
[1115.19] and Aima must be going to such parties too.
[1118.81] She wouldn't stay in the university
 all the time with brother around.
[1123.34] -What are you trying to say?
-Just that, Dad,
[1125.84] that it's quite normal for a girl and a boy
to be friends with each other nowadays.
[1129.84] And I made a mistake which you got to see.
[1133.13] I have a better idea than you, I know, 
I have seen the world,
[1137.87] that what is happening and what's not.
[1139.53] If something bad becomes a norm,
[1141.13] that doesn't mean that it is
turned to something good.
[1144.25] If everyone is jumping into a well, 
would you also jump?
[1147.52] No, Dad, you are right.
[1151.04] I hope you are going to think about it.
[1153.82] Okay, ask your mother to get my brown suit
ready, I have to goto a meeting.
[1157.65] -Okay, Dad.
-Okay, and listen...
[1161.10] the cake was really good.
[1162.54] -Thank you , Dad.
-Welcome.
[1171.12] What happened?
[1176.28] Dad? Dad are you okay?
[1178.82] Why did I become unwanted
[1183.47] Nobody knows that
[1188.01] Why did I become unwanted
[1192.61] Nobody knows that
[1204.79] -Would you like to tell where you were?
-No.
[1208.47] Really, so it has come to this point?
[1212.19] I don't want to talk to you.
[1215.06] Oh, wow, the thief scolds the police.
[1221.16] What's up with you, Aima?
[1223.10] Since past few days, we have noticed
that you have been behaving weirdly.
[1227.09] Means, you don't take interest 
in anything I say.
[1230.05] And you go to the university by yourself
too. I mean what's going on? What's wrong?
[1236.93] Zaid I told you, I don't want to
talk to you, go away from here.
[1241.36] May I know why?
[1243.65] When I told you not to discuss it, 
why did you do it then?
[1247.33] -Discuss what?
-The one with auntie and Nosheen.
[1251.00] Oh, that. So what?
[1254.19] -Don't you know what could have happened?
-I just told it to dad.
[1258.16] Whatever, it was mine and mother's matter.
[1260.97] If I shared something
with you to unburden myself,
[1264.03] that didn't mean at all
 that you tell it to everyone.
[1267.19] Aima, I think you are forgetting that
you and me live in the same house.
[1270.74] All your problems are my problem.
[1272.99] And what did you expect, that you are
going to share your problem with me
[1275.55] and I'd keep saying 
all is well, all is well?
[1279.01] And you know me that I can't stand
seeing anyone getting oppressed.
[1284.83] Whatever it was, 
you shouldn't have discussed it.
[1290.84] On one hand there is dad.
[1292.32] He is after me that I don't take
interest in domestic issues
[1295.43] and now if I am taking interest
and pointing out issues
[1297.69] then you have a problem,
what should I do then?
[1300.21] Look, do the things 
with which you are concerned.
[1303.56] Don't interfere in my matters.
[1305.59] Really? Means I don't have 
any concern with your issues now?
[1310.48] Why do you get after one thing.
[1313.89] I think you are worried
about something else,
[1316.90] and you are taking your anger
out over this thing.
[1321.08] Anyway, I get it.
[1323.93] I can guess by your tone that you just
don't want to talk to me, I understand.
[1333.02] Oh, what is wrong with me?
[1340.69] Was everyone at home?
[1343.03] Yes, everyone was there, 
and you know, I met uncle too, today.
[1349.56] Was he in a good mood?
[1352.61] Seemed okay to me, but...
[1357.17] But what?
[1358.02] Mom, I think auntie isn't
comfortable living with him.
[1367.16] That's because  brother Azmat
 is quite dominating.
[1371.79] He doesn't let anyone have a say
 in front of him.
[1373.84] I would never spend my life 
with such a man.
[1382.13] Sometimes you say 
that you don't want a puppet.
[1387.42] And now you don't want someone dominating.
[1390.44] Mom, you are talking about two extremes.
[1393.57] I mean, there is a thing
called understanding.
[1396.69] It's not necessary that there is a puppet
or a dominating person among partners.
[1401.77] Can't married couples live like friends?
[1404.37] In your age, everyone talks like that.
[1409.92] But the reality is any one
of them has to compromise.
[1414.62] Hey, Mom, I don't believe in this.
[1416.93] Okay, I agree
[1419.77] that it is really important to be friends
and have understanding with each other.
[1423.69] but a certain environment 
for that is required.
[1428.38] God! I knew you would say that. 
Don't you get tired?
[1434.90] Okay, show me the guys and I'll meet them.
[1439.37] Right so that you choose
them again to reject them.
[1444.01] I don't have a factory of guys,
[1446.52] that I keep you showing them one after
other and you keep rejecting them.
[1451.85] I don't like any of them, what should I do?
[1454.37] I just don't get you.
[1461.28] Mama, where are you going?
[1464.71] I was thinking of
going on shopping.
[1466.99] -Don't go.
-Why?
[1469.73] I am telling you don't go
or else you'll regret.
[1472.91] Nosheen, what am I going to regret?
[1476.18] Mother, my heart says that we are
going to get some good news.
[1481.03] Nosheen, whenever your heart says
something, you are proven wrong.
[1484.61] Okay, listen, I am going for shopping,
 you should come along.
[1487.74] Don't know how long has it been 
that you haven't gone out.
[1491.01] I'm not interested in roaming around
 like crazy people in malls.
[1494.16] Oh, so in your point of view am I crazy?
[1497.56] No, no, Mama, I'm just asking you not
to go today. You can go tomorrow.
[1501.85] Nosheen why are you being
persistent like small children?
[1504.48] Try to understand, I swear we are
going to get some good news today.
[1509.68] What is wrong? Look at me.
[1513.80] What's wrong?
[1515.93] Tell me clearly what is 
the drama behind this story?
[1520.24] Nothing.
[1522.75] Something is fishy, 
I can guess by your style.
[1537.47] -Dad, did you call me?
-Yes, dear, come sit.
[1543.56] -How are you?
-I am fine.
[1547.18] Zaid was telling me that in a few days
your university is going to be over.
[1551.41] Yes, Dad, just a little time is left.
[1554.68] So, what are your plans for future?
[1557.69] You mean about work?
[1562.25] As soon as my studies are over,
I will apply at a few places.
[1568.01] And from wherever I get 
a call, I will join there.
[1570.72] What if I ask you to join me
after getting done with studies, then?
[1576.91] No pressure. It all depends upon you.
[1580.19] Dad, that is something to be proud
of that you consider me worthy of it.
[1585.52] That's great. I am happy to know that.
[1587.82] I would be glad if you'd join my team.
[1593.00] Okay tell me, did you make some juice
the other day which Nosheen drank?
[1600.96] Yes, Dad. I made it for mother.
[1606.00] What happened then?
[1608.22] She came in the kitchen and without
asking me she picked it up and drank it.
[1617.42] Look, dear, try to forgive
these petty things.
[1623.69] You waste your time in such petty issues.
[1628.00] If you want that peace is maintained
in this house, things stay in order
[1631.44] then you have to make room
 in your heart, broaden it.
[1634.11] Just don't mind it. 
Do you understand why I'm saying?
[1638.97] Yes, Dad.
[1640.52] Even if she did drink the juice,
[1642.61] you could have made some more,
everything was there in the house.
[1646.81] Just remember that when
both parties move forward
[1651.71] only then the distances
between each other can be reduced.
[1654.57] Yes, Dad. I won't let you complain again.
[1658.10] Bless you.
[1659.67] Now make me a glass of juice
so that I see how you make it.
[1664.23] I'll get it right away.
[1668.33] What is wrong? 
Why haven't you done it till now?
[1671.90] So when will you do it?
[1673.74] Is everything done?
[1676.72] If you have received them after edit, 
what are you waiting for then?
[1682.36] I am not going to run away 
with your payment.
[1686.62] Okay, I'm transferring it right now, 
do it right away.
[1691.34] Yeah, okay.
[1702.52] Your mother didn't come?
[1704.40] Actually she wasn't feeling well so I gave
her dinner and then asked her to sleep.
[1710.65] Okay, nice.
[1714.18] Yes, Dad.
[1716.72] Almas, get my clothes ready, I have 
to go somewhere important after dinner.
[1721.99] Okay.
[1731.38] Why don't you check it, 
you are getting so many messages.
[1734.94] I'm not having an affair.
[1755.94] What happened?
[1761.11] Dad? Dad are you okay?
[1764.40] Dad? Aima, water, get some water.
[1767.60] I think... are you getting a heart attack?
[1770.11] Dad? Dad, have some water.
Dad... Wat...
[1775.08] I'm fine. I'm okay.
[1777.36] Nosheen, call the doctor!
[1780.15] Dad...
[1829.85] Listen, is everything all right?
[1832.26] I am really worried, you left dinner too.
[1836.20] Everything is fine. Leave me alone.
[1841.12] You had to go meet someone, 
what about that?
[1844.67] I will go. I will do something, 
don't worry about that.
[1849.36] How can I not worry. 
I am not insensitive like others.
[1854.87] You can tell me and get
it off your chest.
[1857.54] Till when are you going
to keep it to yourself?
[1859.30]  One can ease the burden with sharing.
[1864.37] Dad, you forgot your phone there,
I thought I should return it.
[1876.56] -Dad, you don't seem okay.
-I am perfectly fine.
[1882.14] -Should I get some juice for you, Dad?
-No, no need for that.
[1887.27] Do you need anything else then? 
Should I get that?
[1889.81] I want to stay alone for a while.
[1892.92] But , Dad you aren't well.
[1894.61] I said, I'm fine. Now go from here.
[1904.87] Almas, you go as well.
[1909.54] Leave me alone for a while.
[1924.91] Aima, Dad isn't angry with you.
[1927.51] It must be something between elders
that's why he sent you away from there.
[1931.44] Zaid, I am getting anxiety attacks. It seem
like my soul is being drained from my body.
[1936.27] I just don't understand,
why are you so tensed?
[1939.43] You getting worried
doesn't make sense.
[1945.86] If Dad has gone to talk
to auntie, this means
[1948.77] it's not business related,
it's about something at home,
[1951.87] But, but what is it?
[1955.08] May be, brother Hammad
tried to contact him.
[1958.33] Or it can be something related to Nosheen.
[1962.71] There is no way that it's related to you, 
so please calm down.
[1973.10] Zaid...
[1977.40] Aima? Look at yourself, 
you seem scared to death, sit here.
[1982.03] Sit down, wait a second,
let me get some water.
[1987.71] Zaid I'm really sorry,
I should have told you earlier.
[1992.84] What sorry, what are you mumbling?
Have some water.
[1997.60] Wait a second. Hello?
[2001.62] Yes, greetings, uncle Sharafat. 
How are you doing?
[2006.42] Yes, I think Dad was
talking about a meeting.
[2009.93] But he is at home today.
[2013.72] Yes, he was a little unwell, so...
[2017.79] Yes, hold on, I'll let
him talk to you. yes.
[2022.49] What happened so suddenly, 
that Dad got so worried?
[2028.56] What if any picture of mine...
[2035.78] Why did I become unwanted
[2040.34] Nobody knows that.
[2045.00] Why did I become unwanted
[2049.62] Nobody knows that.
[2054.48] What news did he get through messages
due to which he got so worried?
[2058.55] You know, he doesn't talk 
to anyone when he is worried.
[2061.15] He sent Mama and Nosheen
out of his room too.
[2065.59] He has asked me that...
[2068.97] whatever proposals Aima has got, consider
them and whichever seems suitable,
[2075.80] get Aima married as soon as possible.
[2081.85] Do you remember, Dad?
[2083.90] When you left your phone,
 I brought it back to you.
[2088.12] I have seen everything, Dad. 
And I know why you are worried.
