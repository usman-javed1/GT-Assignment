From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned how to chirp from you Anyway, who is this friend? I have invited Sania. What? The same Sania whom you were taking
selfies with getting too close to her? What if he minds it when he finds out. What are you saying?
Which home? Whose son? What does he has to do with
the problems of this home? He has left this home, Zaid. Now you guys should
prepare yourself to run around. Sister, brother Azmat, you both
are going to be grand parents. Yes, my Zoya is expecting. Nosheen, why are you sitting here? Actually, auntie,
I'm feeling really  unwell. I just vomited too. -Vomit?
-Yeah, I think I've good food poisoning. Don't worry, you'll be fine. How am I going to be
fine just like that by myself? I'll have to take some medicine. Yes, you're right. It's important
to take you to the doctor. Auntie, I'm not feeling well
and Faiq has planned a dinner. -And I can't even stand properly.
-Just don't worry, I will handle everything for the dinner. No auntie, Faiq is going to feel so bad. He had asked me to help you. Nosheen, as I said, I'm going to handle
everything for the dinner and Faiq too. You just come with me and get a test done. Test? Which test? Test through which we can find out if you
have got food poisoning or something else. Okay then, I'll go change and we'll leave. Okay, fine. Mom, why did you need to do all this? 
Such a huge lie? This was needed, they
needed to have this shock. But that's not true. And you said that
you were taking the sweet for uncle. Yes, it's true that it isn't true. But only you and I know this. They
only know that you are pregnant. Mom, we are lying about such a big thing. And till when can we hide it? Oh, please, stop arguing
about truth and false right now. Everything is going to be fine. No, Mom, I can't carry on with
this drama, and in a few days everybody is going to
know about it as well. I can't do this. Relax, why are you panicking? Mom, tell me, how can I manage this drama? I have planned everything. 
Everything will be done. Mom, look, I can't do this. Let's do one thing, let's tell them
right now that we were mistaken, Please, Mom, lets end this right here. Keep quiet. You are talking so loudly,
what if someone hears you? All our plan is going to be wasted. Mom, this isn't a drama going
on, I can't tell this lie, I'm sorry. You are going to do it, 
and you have to do it. When you can't get
things done the right way you have to choose
the wrong way to do it. Mom, I don't understand why did you do it? Don't you want to move out of this house? Mom, if Zaid gets to know about it you have
no idea what he is going to do about it. For God's sake, Zoya, 
please stop getting scared. Besides, whatever I am
doing is because of Zaid only. Mom, he hasn't done any such
thing that I deceive him like this. Why? Haven't the people in
this house made your life hell? Still, Mom, this is no way to take revenge. You are so stupid, that's
why I have to do all this. But I promise, I'll
take care of everything. Everything is going to be fine
and no one will know anything. Look at this, the interior
of your new restaurant. Wow, Sania, this is amazing. Isn't it? I knew it you are
going to like it for sure. Obviously, it's so simple and stylish. Man, thank God you liked it, 
I was getting really nervous. -But why? I trust you completely.
-Thanks for trusting me. Because I wasn't too confident for it.
This is my first project of a restaurant. And I really wanted you to like it. Sania, if a thing is
good everyone likes it. Yeah but everyone has their own taste. Yeah, that's true. Okay, listen, I am going to get all
this interior made under my supervision. Sure, whatever suits you. Yeah, because I also want to
experience how to deal with workers. And once I get it then you'll see I am going to leave
my job and focus on this work only. Good idea, that's a great thing to do. Yeah, I was always
fond of interior designing. Well, good luck then. By the way, Faiq, shall
I ask you something? Sania, you don't need to
take permission for that. No, actually I was talking
about your friend, Salman. Why? What happened? Does he have any issues with me? Is there any problem,
did he say anything to you? No, he didn't say anything directly, but I get a feeling that he
doesn't really like me much, or may be he is a little insecure by me. No, it's nothing like that, 
I think you are just over-reacting. I don't know, but whenever
I share an idea with him, he responds in a very sarcastic way. Actually, Sania, he has
left his job to join me. I think when you share your
ideas may be he feels bad. Yeah, that's what I'm saying
that he is insecure by me. Okay, you don't worry, I'll talk to him. No, I think I should keep my
suggestions to myself, Faiq. Sania, what's wrong with you? 
No need to be so formal. You are taking interest in
my work and I am liking it. -And what about your friend?
-Don't worry, I'll talk to him. You are doing your job
and he is doing his, that's it. Oh, I remember, you are having lunch with
me tomorrow afternoon. Okay, where and what are we celebrating? I'm sitting with you right now, 
are we celebrating anything? Oh, no, I meant to say that you
are inviting me specially like that. So I asked. Yeah, you can say that
there is a special reason. And what's that? Sania, I want you to visit my home
and meet my mother and my wife. Yeah, that's a good idea, but... If it's a good idea why this 'but' then? Faiq, I'm a bit confused
about going to your home. -But why?
-Just like that. Look, there is nothing such as just
like that. You have to tell me the reason. No, there isn't any reason. Well then you are coming to
my home tomorrow. That's it. -You are so persistent.
-Yeah, that I am. Okay, listen, I'll pick you tomorrow. -No, it's okay, I'll come by myself.
-But your car is broken. Yes, but I can manage. Look, I am coming to pick you
tomorrow, just be ready on time. Oh, God, you'll see, I am going
to complain to auntie about you. All right, you can
fulfill this wish of yours too. Now show me the rest of the designs. Really, Mom? Are you telling the truth? Yes, I am telling you the truth. I just can't believe that I am
going to become a grandmother. I feel as if it was just yesterday when I
got the news that you came into this world. Zaid, may God bless you
with the happiness of your child. Thank you so much, Dad. You know, I have already thought of
names, for boys and for girls too. You and Zoya may choose from them. -You thought of names so soon?
-Yes, why not? I didn't get any chance to do
that when my kids were born. This means you didn't like it
that my mother named our kids. Of course, they were my kids, A mother has some desires too, 
but nobody cared about me. I just got informed that
we have kept this name. And now you are thinking to do the same
with Zoya, what is she going to think then? No, Azmat, I'm not going to do that. I am just asking them to
choose from those names. Mom, you have got full permission to
choose from me, rather from me and Zoya. -You are free to choose.
-Look at that, my good up bringing. Anyway, if you guys need
to do some shopping go ahead,  and I am going to start from tomorrow... Have a little patience, 
there is still a lot of time. You should concentrate
on Zoya's health for now. -And you too, my dear Zaid.
-Sure, dad. Don't you worry about that. 
Leave that to me. I just don't know how
these months will pass. Go and meet your wife. -She must be waiting for you.
-Okay. I'm so happy. It seems as happiness has
come to our home after such a long time. Yes, your happiness is
apparent on your face. Why? Aren't you happy, Azmat? A person is happier to get the profit on his principal
investment than the principal itself. The only difference is that you are
expressing your happiness through your words
and I'm feeling it within. But we both are going
through the same situation. Mrs. Zaid, the news that I just heard, is that true? If you have got the
news then it must be true. No, but I want to hear it from you. Yes Zaid, I'm, I'm expecting. Really? Thank you so much! I just don't understand how
am I going to react, I mean... someone is going to call
me dad. Can you believe? Look, if I do anything weird just
let me know. It's just too much. -So, do you think that I'm used to all this?
-No, I didn't mean it that way, but... You, when did this happen? I mean when did you get the test
done? You didn't even tell me. Actually, I got the test
done at mom's place. I wasn't feeling well there so she
asked me to get the test done. Why didn't you tell me if
you weren't feeling well? -Actually...
-Right! How would have you surprised me then? I get it, I get it, all right. You don't seem too excited. Everything okay? No it's nothing, just a little anxiety. Listen, Zoya, I know that we are a little
distanced from each other since past few days. But I want you to forget everything.
We are going to start afresh. Just forget everything, we are not
going to fight over the past anymore. And whenever you want anything,
your servant is here for you. Be it 3:00 am or 7:00 am, just kick
me without hesitation and wake me up. Okay, means this offer
is valid for the child only? -Of course not...
-No, I mean don't I have any importance? Actually you are important only, I was
just saying dialogues from some movie. Seriously, Zoya, anything you want. Whatever you want, I'm there for you. Are you going to do whatever I ask? Yes, anything. Come let's go inside. Come on. Auntie, he is married now but he
still gets stubborn over petty things. Oh, please, stop it, it's no use.
Mom knows that I'm not stubborn at all. Right, mom? Tell her that. -I don't want to interfere between you two.
-See, what did she say while smiling? Mom has aid that she
doesn't want to interfere, means she has no evidence
to prove that I'm stubborn. Basically she wants to
say that you're too stubborn. That's what you think. Sania, just let him talk, please have
something, you aren't taking anything. Mom, just stop, if she takes everything
what is Nosheen going to have? Stop this nonsense, Faiq, she is our guest. Faiq, I haven't seen
Nosheen, isn't she home? No, she is home but she isn't
feeling well, that's why she is sleeping. Oh okay, let her sleep then. -Do you want this?
-Yeah. Oh, you guys started eating without me. I took a little nap, anyway. You weren't feeling well and you
slept too, that's why I didn't call you. Anyway, forget it. How are you feeling now?
Have a seat I'll dish out food for you. No, I'll have it in my room now. Nosheen, meet her, 
she is a good friend of mine. Yeah, Faiq has told me a lot about you. How are you doing, Nosheen? I'm fine, and no need
to be so formal with me. Because I'm much younger than
you, so you can address me casually. Faiq was very right about
you. You're actually very bold. Yeah, that she is. Do you guys talk about
me only when you meet? Yeah, we often talk about you. Really? Faiq has told
me a lot about you too. Really? Like what? Like about your marriage and the toxic relationship
between you and your husband. I felt really bad about knowing it. Well, it's good, 
because you have another option now. You can trap anyone you like. Nosheen, is this the way to talk? Oh, I was just joking. Nosheen, I think you need rest. You go rest in your room, 
I'll send your lunch there. Faiq, I think I should go. It skipped my mind that I need to
make some presentations for office. How can you go like that, you
haven't even had your lunch yet. And there is sweet dish too. I
have made a sweet dish for you too. Sania, mom is right. Just have the
sweet dish and I'll drop you after that. No, Faiq, I have to leave now. 
Auntie, I'll take your leave. -Good bye.
-Okay, good bye. Thank you for coming. I'm going to drop her. You should have been at
home right now, not with me. Stop it, Sania. -I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
-Why are you sorry, Faiq? I don't know what to say, 
I don't understand anything. -Please, don't be, it's okay.
-It's not okay. You came to my house because I forced
you too, and all this is because of me. Forget it, I told you I didn't mind. Sania, I'm not a kid that
I don't notice anything. I hate this girl, I don't like her at all. -Please stop it, Faiq. She is your wife.
-So what? If I don't like her then I don't. What can I do about it? -Sania, I'm falling in love with...
-Just stop it, Faiq! Don't you dare say anything stupid. Don't say anything that makes
me not seeing you ever again. -I'm sorry.
-That's it. Stop the car. Drop me right here. -But how are you going to go home?
-I said stop the car. -Sania, how will yo go...
-I said stop the car, Faiq! Just listen to me, how
will you reach home? That's it, I don't want to
hear anything. Stop the car and drop me. -I want to get off here.
-Okay, relax, relax. What did tell you? Stop the car. Okay. -Sania, listen...
-Enough, Faiq. Oh, God, where is this guy? He isn't picking up his phone. Faiq! Let me just send a message. Ma'am, this is ma’am Nosheen's report. Oh, you got her report? 
Okay, you can go, Zafar. The mechanic to repair the motor is here. The go get it repaired,
why are you asking me? We have to pay
him 2000/- Rupees/ Zafar, you have the expense money, give
it from them. I'll take care of it later. First let me call him. Faiq, pick up your phone! What does the report say? Oh! It says positive! Oh, thank you God! They both are so stupid. 
They keep fighting only. They don't know that they
are going to become parents. I won't tell them now. When
they are together, I'll tell only then. Let me try once again. He will come home eventually. Let me check up on Nosheen. No, we'll meet soon. Take care. Faiq, come here. Where are you going? I am going to set her straight,
and please don't you stop me now. -Listen to me, first.
-I don't want to listen to you. -Before you come to me, I have come myself.
-Aren't you ashamed at all? How were you talking in front of Sania? Now you are going to tell
me about being ashamed? The one who has brought her girl friend to
meet his wife and expects me to respect her? Are you in your senses? -Faiq! Is this the way to talk?
-Leave me. Mom, ask her how she
was talking in front of Sania. Mom, just ask him, has he asked
me how I was feeling even once? All he thinks about is Sania. I know everything. All these
excuses are just to avoid chores. Mom, tell him, that am I actually unwell
or am I making excuses? You are actually mentally sick, and
there is no cure for that, Nosheen. -Shut up.
-You shut up and get out of my house. Shut up both of you. Just shut up. I am waiting here for you
both to tell you the news and you both are fighting like kids. Sorry, Mom, please say
what you were saying. Faiq, Nosheen is actually unwell. I took her to the doctor and that's
why I got her pregnancy test done. Nosheen, your report is here. You are expecting. You both are going to become parents! And still you're fighting like kids. I'm sorry, Mom. Faiq, don't say sorry to me, say it to her. Try to understand. God has given
you guys such great happiness. You have to decide you
to carry on with your life. I am not going to hear any more
fights in this house, understood? Hello, mama, Hello, how are you feeling now? I'm still the same, Mama, I am going to feel
the same for a few days now. What do you mean? What kind
of an idiot doctor did you visit? Mama, you are not getting
what I am trying to tell you. Oh, Nosheen, I don't have
so much brains in this age. What are you saying I don't get it. Okay, then listen to a good news. You told me that I am
going to become an aunt. Yes, I did. Well, then know this that with your son's child you are going to
become a grandma with your daughter's child too. What? Such a great news! Thank God! God has sent so much happiness to
our home. May he saves us from evil eyes. Amen. You know, Nosheen, this
is an honor for a woman, and God has blessed only a woman with it. And He has placed
heaven under her feet too. Nosheen, why have you gone quiet? How did your mother in law and
husband respond? Are they happy? Yeah, my mother in law is very happy. -And what about Faiq?
-I don't know. What do you mean you don't know?
Nosheen, tell me clearly what is it? You are making me worried. No, mama, it's nothing. Just don't worry. How can I not worry, Nosheen,
you just made me tensed. Mama, you are just used
to get worried on everything. -But Faiq...
-Faiq is happy. He has gone out for some work. Nosheen, are you telling
me the truth? Is that true? Yeah, mama, I'm telling
the truth, believe me. Thank God that He has
shown us this day too. Look, please now stop fighting with Faiq. And take good care of yourself. Mama, if you want you can
inform others at your house too. Nobody would be happy knowing
about it, but still inform them. What do you mean by no one is
going to be happy? Why won't they be? Okay then tell them. Anyway, listen Nosheen, take
good care of yourself, okay? Yeah, got it. Okay now hang up, I think Faiq is back. Okay, okay. Oh, God, You have
shown us such a great day. By the grace of God. Faiq! Is this the way to talk? Mom, ask her how she
was talking in front of Sania. -I have invited Sania.
-What? The same Sania whom you were taking
selfies with getting too close to her? You talk such nonsense, Nosheen. For now, tell me who told
you to invite her home? Look, Nosheen, this is my home. And I can invite whoever
I want, whenever I want. And I am not asking
you, I am telling you that you have to be
home tomorrow, that's it. -How was the doctor's visit?
-It was all right. The doctor has said that by
grace of God, everything is perfect. You both came at such a good time. Just see what your sister has
got for the baby from the market. Neither you are getting
it, nor anyone else. Everyone is just celebrating 
the entry of a new member, that's it. Did you ever thing about
the kid who is yet to come? He is going to watch his parents
fight everyday. How is he going to feel? Are we going to give him this environment? Azmat Hussain is one tough nut. He may give a heart attack to
others but nothing will happen to him. And don't you worry at all. Because Zaid is going
to leave Aima for sure. He has got no other option.
