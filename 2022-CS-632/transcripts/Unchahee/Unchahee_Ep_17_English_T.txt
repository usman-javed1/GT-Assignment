[0.00] From flowers and from buds
[4.34] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.09] When I saw you
[14.09] I learned how to chirp from you
[18.86] I want that you too should forgive Nosheen.
[23.41] You have a very big heart, Aima.
[26.16] A person who made sure
that you should get humiliated,
[29.21] you forgave her without
giving it a second thought?
[31.62] I actually want to help you
with everything.
[35.90] Of course, you both are going
to help me happily.
[39.74] Because my Nosheen is going away
from this house.
[42.13] Rather she is being kicked out
of this house.
[44.99] Auntie, usually you give the news
from whole world to mom.
[48.82] But you didn't tell her what your
daughter, Nosheen has done.
[51.75] Amber, don't believe
any rumors that you hear.
[55.65] Okay, I'm coming.
[57.96] Oh, I'm such a fool.
[66.96] Do one thing, send her
to me while you leave.
[71.01] -Who?
-Nosheen, who else?
[74.65] Do you want something from her?
[76.83] Before she leaves, I want her
to clear her heart from my side.
[82.91] I don't want her to think of me
as a cruel person forever.
[87.08] She needs to see my softer side now.
[90.10] That's why I’m calling her.
[92.01] She didn't have a few things
like cosmetics
[95.55] so maybe she went to get that.
[98.36] Oh, cosmetic is left.
[100.09] What do you mean by maybe?
Didn't she tell you before she left?
[103.20] Maybe she couldn't find me
so that she could tell me.
[106.51] I'll send her.
[108.93] You're just amazing. You stay at home
and still you have no clue.
[113.54] Saying maybe on everything.
[130.95] What sort of house is this?
No light is working, nor any fan.
[138.06] There is just one fan
even that is of no use.
[143.30] This is such an old house.
[147.40] Doesn’t seem like anyone lives here.
[151.38] This Faisal, don’t know
where he has gone after dropping me.
[155.44] He can’t do anything properly.
[160.14] And he has even asked me
to switch my phone of.
[178.08] It''s 9:00 pm.
[180.54] Nosheen is still missing.
[183.29] I’m so frightened.
[186.25] Sister, please don’t worry.
[190.52] When one goes out for shopping,
it takes a little more time sometimes.
[195.76] What kind of shopping is it.
She has been gone before I even woke up.
[201.05] She still isn’t back, Shabana.
[207.28] Did you call Nosheen?
[209.55] Her phone is switched off.
[213.87] Phone''s switched off?
[217.14] Oh, God! What if someone
has stolen her cell phone?
[223.18] -What if some has taken her...
-God forbid. Sister...
[230.11] Say positive things.
[231.61] Being positive right now
is like deceiving oneself.
[237.65] I’m saying what I feel.
[243.77] May God protect Nosheen.
[248.20] Don’t worry. I keep praying
for every member of this house.
[252.80] I just hope she gets back
before Azmat arrives, or else...
[258.15] only I know what Azmat is going to do.
[263.11] And Zaid, I don’t know
where he has been since morning.
[269.47] Actually, Zaid has gone shopping with Aima.
[275.83] Oh, you mother and
daughter...
[278.20] His mother is worried since morning
and he has gone shopping.
[285.40] What are you looking at? Call your
daughter. My head is about to explode.
[290.01] Yes, I’ll call her right away
and tell her to come home.
[292.92] Hurry up.
[307.39] Your daughter is missing since morning.
[310.18] And you’re telling me this now?
[313.42] I thought she is gone shopping,
she’ll return in a while.
[317.34] But she is still not back.
[318.95] It''s 9:00 pm, Mama.
Almost the whole day has passed.
[323.22] There is a limit of being careless,
for God''s sake.
[327.56] You don't even know
when she gets out of home.
[329.98] Do you have a thing called shame?
[333.58] When I asked you to send Nosheen
to me even then you refused.
[340.62] We are seeing this day today just because
of your carelessness and cunningness.
[345.91] Dad, please don’t get angry. Calm down.
[348.67] Just think with a cool mind
what can be done.
[356.29] Mama, did you call her friends and ask?
[360.08] I’ve called everyone,
nobody knows where she is.
[366.29] Some were saying
that I should call that boy too.
[373.87] -What boy?
-Faisal.
[376.69] Oh, God! Come on.
[378.80] -Did you call him?
-I don’t have his number.
[383.12] Zaid, let''s go, we’ll
have to report to the police,
[385.89] we don’t have any other option.
[388.24] Dad, I think we should check
other places first.
[390.32] You know, I don’t want to involve
the police, it''s a really sensitive issue.
[393.23] Where else can she go?
[395.59] I don’t know. I had an idea to track
her location by tracking her phone.
[399.77] But, her phone is switched off.
[404.23] We have already wasted too much time.
[407.97] It''s not right to wait any longer.
[410.26] Whatever you have to do, do it quick.
[411.71] But I think there is no use of all this.
We have to involve the police.
[416.10] Dad, I think before going to the police
station we need to check the hospitals.
[422.70] Okay.
[424.71] Oh, God! My heart is sinking.
[428.05] Oh, God, please protect my daughter.
[432.48] -Zaid, get the car ready, I’m coming.
-Okay, Dad.
[439.90] Now you can cry all you want.
[450.02] I... I’m really scared.
[455.73] Mother, why are you getting worried.
She must be fine.
[460.50] And you’ll see, she will return herself.
[466.75] With God''s will,
everything is going to be fine.
[471.06] But my heart is sinking.
[477.94] I’m really worried.
[481.26] And I can’t help it.
[485.05] Until I’m alive, I am going
to worry in such situations.
[490.10] It''s natural like everyone
else gets worried.
[494.81] I’m sorry, Mother. I didn't mean that.
[498.19] I’m just worried about you.
[500.57] Yes, I know that.
[505.89] I share my sorrow with you.
[509.90] If I’ll keep things to myself then
[514.28] I don’t know what''s going
to happen to me.
[517.58] Yes, Mother, you are right.
[519.46] I don’t know why do I have a feeling
[524.55] that Nosheen has done
something really stupid.
[531.40] I think this time
she has taken a huge step.
[535.05] What do you mean? What step?
[539.29] I wish that what I’m saying
is proven wrong.
[543.96] She gets back home safely.
[546.69] But I have a feeling
that she has left home herself.
[554.71] But why would she do that, Mother?
[557.85] That is not the question.
The question is why wouldn’t she do it?
[562.49] Has she ever listened to
what brother has said.
[567.94] I don’t know why is she crazy
after that guy.
[572.59] But, Mother, Zaid was telling me
that she was ready for this marriage.
[576.51] And she met
the groom''s family very cordially.
[580.01] They liked her too.
[582.86] Even aunty told me
that she is really happy.
[585.96] Dear, it takes a lot of time
to develop one's personality.
[593.89] And it takes even more time to change it.
[599.39] The way Nosheen's nature is
[602.42] nothing can be changed in just two days.
[609.12] And, I already had doubts,
but I didn't say anything.
[617.04] You’re right, Mother.
[619.26] Even I was surprised on her obedience.
[625.21] Maybe she had planned all this earlier.
[630.79] I just wish, I wish all
of it just get's all right.
[636.12] What I’m fearing is proven wrong
and Nosheen gets back home safely.
[645.25] With God''s will.
[653.66] Faisal, where have you brought me?
It's such a weird house.
[658.70] You told me that you are
going to take me to your home,
[660.78] and you have thrown
me in this stupid house.
[664.18] Darling, just listen to me.
Wait for a little while.
[667.49] I don't want to wait. Take me to your home.
[670.45] -I can’t take you.
-What do you mean, you cant take me?
[674.62] You said that your mother knows about us.
[677.13] Try to understand, dear.
[679.35] Who is going to make a girl who has
run away from her home, their honor?
[684.32] Is this what she thinks of me, Faisal?
[687.48] You said that you mother knows about us.
[690.09] I told her. I told her for sure.
[692.47] But I didn't' tell her that I am going
to run off with you.
[696.45] They won't accept you like this.
[698.71] What am I supposed to do now?
[700.43] That''s why I’m telling you to wait
a little. Let me think of something.
[705.24] And why did you run off from home?
[708.74] See, now we are in even more trouble.
[711.54] Faisal, I have left my house,
my parents for you
[716.75] and this is what you have to say to me?
[718.10] Darling, I’m worried about you only.
[722.69] In fact I want to marry you as soon as
possible and take you home honorably.
[730.33] And obviously, this is the house
I could arrange in a hurry.
[736.58] Now, if you don't like it,
or however it is, what could I do?
[739.43] You call this mess a house?
[741.84] I did whatever I could in my capacity.
[744.96] And you know how my financial condition is.
[748.11] You could have hired
a much better place than this.
[751.26] Why didn't you use the money
that I gave you?
[753.93] Darling I’m sorry, but with the money
you gave me, only this could be arranged.
[759.98] So, Faisal, till when is it
going to be this way
[761.78] that you’re gone and I'll wait
for you all day like an idiot?
[765.79] Do you actually want to go to my home?
[771.88] Do you want to do court marriage with me?
[772.93] My Nosheen can't do this.
This is a conspiracy.
[776.49] All this is your conspiracy.
[779.70] You had the keys to my room/
[783.28] You have stolen my jewelry.
[785.14] And you’ve put the blame on Nosheen.
[788.17] Why did I become unwanted
[792.70] Nobody knows that
[797.44] Why did I become unwanted
[801.97] Nobody knows that
[810.84] Faisal, getting secretly married like this
doesn't seem right to me.
[814.31] Okay, no issue. I just wanted
to take your opinion.
[819.26] First make arrangements for  my stay.
[824.27] We’ll think about marriage later.
[826.58] There is a nice flat that I know.
[830.66] -Then?
-They are asking for 0.25 million
[834.07] as advance. And you know my condition.
I don't have a single rupee.
[838.08] By the way, how much money
have you brought?
[841.16] Faisal, I haven't brought
any money with me.
[844.74] Just this jewelry
[867.00] It''s decided then.
[869.53] Faisal, I haven’t brought them to sell.
[872.30] But, Nosheen, we'll have to do something.
[876.88] Mama was telling me that Dad has put
some money in my account, but I'm not sure.
[884.25] Why don't you log in to
your account and check.
[885.92] It isn’t confirmed but we can check.
[888.42] Okay then check it out.
[902.70] Five million! Wow, we have hit a jack pot!
[917.26] Sister, have some water.
[922.67] May God never test anyone with their kids.
[928.00] Sister, when God tests us then
he gives ease to us along with it.
[932.83] God will reward us for this difficulty.
[936.80] It''s just tests and tests for me.
[940.66] When will the ease come?
[942.41] When can I live carefree
in this house, like you.
[951.18] At this hour at night,
[952.91] Don't know how would she be.
[955.62] Sister, wherever she'll be,
she'll be in God's protection.
[960.26] I wish that God protects her all the time.
[964.40] Had Hammad been here, he wouldn't
have let any injustice done to Nosheen.
[969.70] He is actually my son, my son.
[975.70] You, just lie down for a while.
[979.22] Take rest for a while. Shut you your eyes.
[982.60] Whenever I shut my eyes,
Nosheen's face appears in front of me.
[988.44] Okay do one thing that take the tablet
you take for anxiety.
[995.52] - Tell me where it is?
-Yes, it's in my drawer.
[998.39] -I'll get it.
-No. I'll get it myself.
[1015.68] -Did you open my drawer?
-Me?
[1020.36] No, sister, what do I have
to do with your drawer?
[1022.88] Did someone come to my room
when I was away?
[1025.18] Yes, Nosheen took the keys from me.
She needed something.
[1032.59] Is everything all right, sister?
All okay? Sister are you all right?
[1037.75] Sister! What's wrong sister?
[1041.86] Are you all right? Sister? Sister?
[1045.47] Sister, get up.
[1047.66] Oh, God! who should I call? Sister, sister!
[1051.56] It would be really helpful for us to start.
[1053.57] But don't think that I have
my eyes on your money.
[1056.85] I'm saying it because your dad
might block your account.
[1060.36] So, do one thing,
transfer the money to my account.
[1063.19]  Oh, and give the password to me too.
[1065.95] -Faisal, Dad has transferred
this money to my account...
[1069.75] Wow, that's commendable.
[1072.06] You trusted me so much
that you left your family and came to me.
[1076.07] And now for such a small amount you
are doubting your would-be husband.
[1080.85] Faisal, it's not a small amount,
it's a big amount.
[1084.37] No problem. Stay here, spend time.
I have no issues anyway.
[1088.64] And yes, don't regret later
when he blocks your account.
[1094.86] And me, I can spend my life
in a simple way.
[1098.38] No, Faisal, it's not like that.
I don't doubt you.
[1102.69] What's your problem then?
Don't you want to stay happy with me?
[1109.76] Okay what do I have to do?
[1112.62] Nothing much. Just do one thing,
give me your jewelry sets.
[1119.43] -And why is that?
-You know this house isn't safe,
[1123.47] so I'll keep them at a safe place.
[1128.05] And me? What about my safety, Faisal?
[1131.11] Oh come on, listen, whatever I'm doing,
I'm doing it for your safety.
[1138.96] I'm doing to for both of our betterment.
So, just trust me.
[1157.42] Sister, sister! Sister.
[1163.92] Are you all right?
[1168.24] Here, have some water.
[1175.11] Don't know what happened to me.
[1180.12] Nosheen? My Nosheen can't do that.
[1184.14] This is a conspiracy,
this is a conspiracy by you.
[1188.51] You had the keys to my room,
you have stolen my jewelry.
[1194.09] And you've put the blame on Nosheen.
[1202.30] Sister? For God's sake.
Don't accuse me of such a thing.
[1209.16] At least show some consideration.
[1213.29] Consideration? What for?
For stabbing me in the back?
[1218.30] I trusted you, Shabana,
but you deceived me.
[1222.95] Sister, you have given me the keys to your
room before, have I ever done such a thing?
[1228.12] That's because you have
never been caught before.
[1229.89] You already had evil
intentions, Shabana.
[1232.00] I'm telling you that Nosheen
took the keys from me.
[1235.46] I didn't even step foot in your room.
[1237.84] Stop lying. Don't know since how
long did you have your eyes on them.
[1241.16] -How dare you hit my sister?
-Brother, brother, no.
[1243.88] -How are you talking to her?
-No, no.
[1245.48] -You are accusing her? What is wrong?
-No, no.
[1249.46] Are you going to tell what has happened?
[1251.09] Brother, I'll tell you.
[1257.34] Sister's jewelry has been stolen.
[1260.27] There is a catastrophe in our house
today. We have lost everything suddenly.
[1265.01] Don't try to negate the reality.
All of this is done by you daughter.
[1270.04] She caused harm to those who benefited her.
[1272.46] My daughter hasn't done anything.
[1274.27] Someone from them trying
to exploit the situation in the house.
[1276.81] Don't you dare say something foolish.
[1279.00] Stay in your limits or I'll do something
to you that you'll remember all your life.
[1283.30] Oh, yes. It is normal
to hit women in this house.
[1287.06] You've already hit your daughter,
and now me too...
[1290.83] -You are arguing with me again?
-Brother, for God's sake.
[1294.65] Listen to your sister.
[1296.29] If you want to stay in this house
respectfully, then hold your tongue.
[1303.10] Or else I'm going to do that with you that
you'll be out on the streets at this age.
[1307.27] No brother.
[1310.96] -Shabana, go. Go from here.
-Yes, brother.
[1319.93] What I have said to you,
think over it carefully.
[1325.03] And do as I say.
[1328.62] You have ruined my life.
[1345.06] Dad, I have got all his information.
[1348.83] And I've asked a few people
to keep an eye on him if they see him.
[1353.26] The problem is that he hasn't
gone home for a week.
[1358.72] I can't find his mobile number.
Or else, it's a matter of hours.
[1369.85] I just don't understand
how did Nosheen take such a step.
[1373.63] She trusted such a cheap stranger.
[1381.09] But whatever we have to
do, we have to do it quick,
[1383.67] because all the arrangements
have been made.
[1386.79] We have sent the invitation cards.
[1392.17] If we'll be late it's going
to be a huge problem.
[1397.41] But don't worry, I'll try my best.
[1401.67] No need for that.
[1407.23] No need to try.
[1410.85] Stop everyone.
[1413.38] Dad, what are we going
to tell the groom's family?
[1416.55] -I'm going to tell them everything clearly.
-Then what, Dad?
[1420.97] This marriage won't happen. The groom's
house is going to be saved from mischief.
[1429.35] I'm going to confess in front of them that
I was handing over my problems to you.
[1438.67] That guy is going to get married
to a virtuous girl.
[1445.41] People will talk about us, despise us.
[1450.73] But this agony will be for a few days only.
We won't die everyday.
[1455.37] We will be humiliated
for a little while only.
[1457.07] -But, Dad, Nosheen?
-Don't take her name in front of me.
[1462.67] And you don't need to look for her either.
[1466.72] Who has  torn our honor to pieces.
[1470.30] -But, Dad, she...
-Stop worrying about her.
[1475.44] She has nothing to do with this house now.
[1479.90] It's too late, go and get some sleep.
[1512.46] Try to do what she wants.
[1515.92] After all she agreed to what I asked her.
She accepted my decision happily.
[1519.78] So, I want that the rest
is according to her choice.
[1523.67] She shouldn't have any complains.
[1549.59] She has the support of her brother.
[1552.81] But today, Azmat has
crossed all the limits.
[1556.17] Why? What did brother Azmat do?
[1558.99] I just said something to his sister,
he was about to hit me.
[1564.66] Why did I become unwanted
[1569.41] Nobody knows that
[1574.07] Why did I become unwanted
[1578.58] Nobody knows that
[1593.34] Dad is right. Why should
we care about Nosheen?
[1597.30] Has Nosheen cared about us,
about our family or our family's honor?
[1602.80] I'd say, it's good that she left home
herself. How are we going to face people.
[1607.38] We have got rid
of these everyday problems.
[1610.21] I know that you are angry right now
and saying all this being emotional.
[1614.84] I'm not being emotional, Aima.
I've thought about it all night.
[1618.48] Whatever Nosheen has done, she had thought
it out carefully, with proper planning.
[1622.47] I'd say that she should get punished
for what she has done.
[1626.10] At least don't curse her, Zaid.
[1628.82] She is your sister.
Are you going to forget even that?
[1632.86] -I guess.
-That's impossible.
[1638.59] Impossible? Why is it impossible?
[1641.16] Everyone has forgotten brother
Hammad too, haven't they?
[1643.72] No one has forgotten
brother Hammad.
[1645.83] Everybody misses him
everyday including Dad.
[1649.63] And his case a bit different.
[1651.81] We all know about where he is,
what is he doing, who has he married.
[1656.85] What's the difference between
Nosheen and brother Hammad then?
[1659.20] Nosheen is a girl. She is young,
immature and innocent.
[1665.16] And we don't know where
that poor girl is right now.
[1668.30] Please, Aima. No one is that immature
at the age of 18 but considered as mature.
[1672.35] In fact whatever she has done,
she has done it with proper planning,
[1674.57]  so please stop defending her.
[1676.89] It's our assumption that
she has run off with Faisal.
[1682.32] Just imagine, what if
the reality is something else.
[1685.49] Look, Zaid,
[1687.70] maybe there has been a mishap
with her, maybe it isn't her fault.
[1692.90] Anything can happen.
[1694.96] Please, Aima, everything is crystal
clear. You want us to close our eyes?
[1699.62] Look, I don't mean that at all, Zaid.
[1703.33] I just want that you don't give up on her.
[1707.35] She is your sister and finding her 
is your responsibility.
[1711.89] Responsibility? And what
about her responsibility?
[1715.59] I know that she has done very wrong.
[1718.90] She has done so wrong that
maybe nothing can be as bad as this.
[1727.41] Zaid, I just want you to try your best.
[1732.34] Without knowing the whole truth, 
you can't leave her like that.
[1740.00] Please, she is your sister.
[1751.64] I'll get some coffee for you, 
Zoya must be here any minute now.
[1776.47] Oh, God! My child, my daughter.
[1779.59] She just got trapped by that cunning man.
[1782.90] Sister, please don't cry.
[1786.44] Just think about what
you'll have to do next.
[1789.04] I am not in a state of mind 
to think about anything.
[1794.90] Whatever happens in the house,
[1796.79] he makes me responsible for everything.
[1800.02] He thinks everything is my fault.
[1802.39] Sister, whatever Nosheen has done, you'll
have to bear the consequences for it.
[1808.71] After all, you have brought her up
[1813.93] Anyway, why do you let your sister-in-law 
say all that to you?
[1818.95] She doesn't need anyone's permission.
She has got her brother's support.
[1823.20] But today, today Azmat
has crossed all limits.
[1827.61] Why? What has he done?
[1830.31] I just said something to his sister, 
he was ready to hit me.
[1837.21] He threatened to divorce me and what not.
[1842.30] Brother Azmat hit you?
[1845.15] My daughter hasn't run away 
from home just like that.
[1847.71] She was compelled to do so, Amber.
[1851.54] It has been a daily routine to hit 
because of these mother and daughter,
[1857.84] But you never told that before.
[1861.16] I never tell you this, Amber. 
It just slipped out of my mouth today.
[1866.78] Anyway, I know that brother Azmat 
is a very short tempered man.
[1872.72] But he hits you as well, 
I had no idea about that.
[1878.22] A person who can forcibly marry her
daughter to anyone can do anything.
[1884.88] I'm telling you, Nosheen
was compelled to do so,
[1886.88]  or else she wouldn't
have done it at all.
[1890.09] Sister, no matter how short tempered 
brother Azmat is,
[1894.09] but Nosheen shouldn't have run off 
from home like that.
[1897.18] So she should have gotten married 
to that old guy?
[1900.12] There are a million ways to convince.
[1902.73] She could have resisted, 
asked for forgiveness,
[1906.32] she should have at least
tried to convince him.
[1910.65] I don't know what brother Azmat is
going to do with her even if she returns.
[1915.74] No one should dare touch my daughter,
enough of forcing her.
[1920.93] I won't let it happen anymore.
[1922.69] They have done so wrong 
with my innocent daughter.
[1929.11] Anyway, sister, she isn't innocent at all.
[1934.38] We all know it very well 
what she has done to Aima.
[1937.34] Innocent girls don't do things like that.
[1940.09] Have you come here to share 
my sorrow or to insult my daughter?
[1944.19] Mp, sister, I didn't mean it like that.
[1949.32] I know, Amber, you still have a grudge 
for Nosheen in your heart.
[1954.95] Today I have come to know
[1956.34] that in difficult times, even 
people's loved ones leave them alone.
[1960.72] It's nothing like that, sister. 
Stop crying please.
[1964.28] We'll think of a solution 
of this problem then.
[1969.11] My child.
[1974.93] What's wrong, Zaid? 
Did you get any news about Nosheen?
[1982.29] Shall I ask you something?
[1985.62] Are you angry at Nosheen 
or worried about her?
[2000.90] I was worried about her first, 
but I'm angry now.
[2004.80] And why are you angry?
[2008.09] What stupid question is this?
[2009.87] I mean, you can tell me. 
Your anger may release after sharing.
[2014.08] The thing she has done to us. She
ruined our dignity, she has deceived us.
[2021.88] That too because of that cheap man.
[2027.62] Our family's reputation has been tainted
 and it's never going to get off.
[2031.58] -Yes, I agree, but she had no other option.
-What do you mean?
[2037.57] I mean, uncle was getting
her married to someone else,
[2040.29]  and she wanted to marry someone else.
[2043.05] This is insane, I mean, 
what could have she done?
[2046.23] Zoya, whatever dad was doing 
was for her own good.
[2049.39] He has seen the world, he knew 
that Faisal is a scumbag.
[2053.30] And Nosheen was only destroying herself 
by being with him.
[2057.36] I know that Faisal is a cheap guy, 
but still Nosheen loves him.
[2062.44] And no matter how much uncle wants
the best for her he can't do anything.
[2067.97] I mean he can't go against her will.
[2073.00] What should have dad done then?
[2077.09] He should have given her some
time, he should have talked to her,
[2080.19] given her options.
[2084.36] Instead taking it to his ego 
and do this to her.
[2089.50] Oh so now all this is our fault?
[2092.92] No, when did I say that?
[2095.77] You are making us the
culprit instead of Nosheen?
[2098.39] Because it seems so
with what you are saying.
[2100.86] Zaid, I'm not defending anyone here.
[2103.66] I'm just saying 
that it's not just Nosheen's fault.
[2107.78] Right, right. So according to you
she should be given a medal on this, right?
[2113.71] What is wrong with you?
[2115.68] Zoya, why don't you understand that
me and dad look at the world differently.
[2120.12] We just wanted to protect 
a girl of our house.
[2122.53] We know the difference between
a noble man and a  scoundrel.
[2125.31] Which you guys don't know.
[2126.73] And hand Nosheen chosen a noble guy, 
what issue would dad have with it?
[2131.02] Just think about it.
[2137.51] Why have I become unwanted
[2142.24] Nobody knows that
[2146.91] Why have I become unwanted
[2151.57] Nobody knows that
[2156.56] Call Faisal right away, 
or let me talk to him on the phone.
[2159.36] What did I tell you? Lower your voice. 
Don't you understand?
[2164.61] I won't, what are you going to do?
[2167.13] To hell with you both, 
do you think I'm mad?
[2169.67] Listen, girl, if you misbehave even once
[2172.37] then you will be responsible
for the consequences.
[2174.26] You should be thankful that even after this
behaviour your dignity is still intact.
[2178.14] Brother, just tell me 
what should I say to her now?
[2181.44] Tell her anything. 
Tell her I have left for Dubai.
[2185.47] Excellent, you have thought 
of such an international excuse.
[2189.15] Yes, she will be at ease 
after knowing about Dubai.
[2192.62] Or else if she gets to know that I am here
[2194.23] then she will find me and won't
give up until I marry her.
