[0.00] From flowers and from buds
[4.54] I have learned to bloom and be fragrant
[9.13] When I saw you
[14.07] I learned how to chirp from you
[18.77] Mother, this girl has lost
her mind, it's nothing else.
[21.37] Faiq, if she is saying it
with so much confidence,
[23.46] there must be something that she felt.
[25.71] Mother, it's nothing like that.
And you know Sania very well.
[31.48] Anyway, you aren't that naive.
[34.72] Look, whatever you want to say, if
you'll say it clearly it would be better.
[40.02] Your son is having an affair with a
girl and you aren't even aware of that?
[44.20] Salman there's this thing,
people are right, life isn't easy.
[49.08] Stop it, man. You have been
talking philosophy since so long.
[54.24] Life isn't that difficult.
[56.21] We are much better than many
others. You should be thankful.
[60.90] You are right.
[62.59] And I have just one suggestion for you now.
[65.66] That do whatever you feel happy about.
[70.73] -Are you happy?
-Me?
[75.12] Where did my happiness come in this?
[104.78] I know that your decision is right,
[108.73] but I don't know why, I am a little
worried regarding this relationship.
[116.82] I can understand what you're trying to say.
[119.17] Look, brother,
[121.44] please don't mind, but I
have no enmity with anyone.
[127.20] There is good and bad in every person.
[130.98] but I have a doubt that
[136.16] sister will never accept Aima as
the daughter in law of this family.
[208.52] Excuse me, doctor!
How is dad doing now?
[213.15] Look, I won't say that
there is nothing wrong
[216.68] because his ECG didn't come out right.
[225.08] We sent his Troponin I test as well,
which came out increased too.
[230.90] Which means that he had his
heart attack because of this factor too.
[241.89] And its intensity is too much as well.
[248.60] -Is he critical?
-Yes.
[253.13] He is in a very critical position.
[264.66] We are giving him treatment, and thank
God that you guys brought him in on time.
[270.13] Doctor, will he be all right?
[273.03] With God's will. Just pray.
[275.23] We are doing some more tests on him.
We'll let you know if we require anything.
[282.62] By the way how is the patient's lifestyle?
[288.66] I mean does he consume oily food much?
[293.64] Or anything which he
is not supposed to take?
[295.46] No, doctor, dad's lifestyle is very
healthy, he takes healthy food only.
[301.44] In fact he goes for morning walk
and at times does exercise too.
[306.14] That's good.
[307.19] Doctor, what may be the cause
of dad's heart attack?
[310.55] -Where does he work?
-He has a business.
[313.58] According to his medical history
it's not supposed to be like that.
[317.58] May be he has taken some kind of stress.
[329.14] Because of which he has build up
a pressure on himself.
[334.97] Or maybe some symptoms showed up
because of which he had a heart attack.
[344.34] No doubt that this is a big decision.
[351.67] I pray to God that may this
decision be beneficial for you.
[356.03] Dad, I hope you don't have any objection.
[361.05] What objection can I have?
[364.93] -I mean, I hope you won't get angry.
-No, not at all.
[369.48] At times, mental stress can cause it too.
[373.21] -But don't worry, we're trying our best.
-Thank you, doctor.
[378.58] Thank you.
[380.42] Zaid, be brave, please.
[383.80] What could have
caused dad's stress, Aima?
[386.17] Everything is going to
be fine. please be brave.
[407.87] Obviously, this must happen.
[410.70] You guys give so much stress to dad.
[412.93] Whoever it is, comes and creates a drama.
[417.46] Who are you talking about, Nosheen?
[419.89] I am saying what I am observing.
[423.31] Now if someone wants to take
the blame then it's up to them.
[428.21] Nosheen, your dad is at the hospital
right now, and in a very critical state.
[434.62] It would be better if you just stop
this nonsense and pray for him.
[438.38] I know what I need to do.
No need to teach me.
[447.31] Oh, what are you arguing about?
[450.17] Mama, why don't you say
something to your sister?
[453.61] Stop it Nosheen.
[458.77] By the way, if anything happens to dad
then there is going to be a huge problem.
[463.19] What are you saying, Nosheen?
Are you in your senses?
[465.84] I am right mama, if anything
happens to dad then...
[470.28] he hasn't even written his will yet.
[476.27] Our home will turn into a battleground.
[483.29] Stop it, Nosheen,
what nonsense are you saying?
[486.81] Mama, I'm telling you the reality.
[489.25] If anything happens to dad right now
[491.06] then brother Hammad will
be the first to claim his share.
[498.72] Zaid is no less, and what do you think,
will Aima and her mother leave their share?
[504.17] Don't know if we will get anything or not.
[507.05] May God have mercy.
[512.01] Now, I don't want that this happens,
[514.34] but a person should at least
think from every aspect, mama.
[518.20] What kind of a child are you who
is talking about his father's death?
[522.41] Mama, you get emotional at everything.
[525.18] I am just saying in general, don't
people have deaths in their homes?
[529.76] Nosheen, just pray for your
dad that he returns safely.
[550.94] Oh, so that's the case. Means whenever
you want to have a treat you think of me.
[557.10] I think that you are taking all the
revenge from school days from me now.
[562.23] Oh, nevermind, the doors of my
restaurant are always open for you.
[568.90] Obviously, you don't need
to say it. Anything for you.
[574.59] Hey, did you watch that
movie which I recommended?
[579.29] Just watch it, it's such
a nice movie, yeah.
[586.49] Yes, mother, anything you want?
[589.15] Okay, I'll call you back. Bye.
[593.25] -Yes, mother, what is it?
-Faiq, how is Mr. Azmat doing now?
[598.63] I don't know, mother.
[599.90] Faiq, why don't you know?
[605.06] Didn't you call Nosheen or Zaid?
[609.17] No, I just went to drop Nosheen.
[612.47] Faiq, this is very wrong.
[615.17] Your in laws are supposed
to be your second family.
[621.14] As much you are a member of this
house, as much you are of that house too.
[626.67] And because of Nosheen,
you are the son of that family.
[630.94] You should support them
in this difficult time.
[634.01] This chatting, phone calls,
all this can happen later too.
[639.99] Right now you should be
aware of your responsibility.
[646.70] You should help Zaid.
[649.06] Okay, fine. If you say, I'll go there.
[652.65] Even if I don't tell you, you
should realize it yourself.
[658.90] Faiq, relationships are always two-ways.
[661.36] One should not expect
from the girl only
[663.27] that she shall compromise
only take care of everyone.
[667.48] A boy shall be as considerate as her.
[670.66] And he should own
the girl and her family sincerely.
[674.57] Only then one can carve a
space in each other's hearts.
[679.61] Of course.
[681.03] You are wise enough yourself.
[684.06] Go and see how Mr. Azmat is doing
and then tell me about it.
[689.14] Okay, mother, sure.
[731.74] Don't know what the issue is,
mom. He is not even picking my call.
[735.33] Shabana was telling that there is an issue
with the network signals at the hospital.
[739.01] Even Aima isn't receiving her calls.
[741.04] If he knows that there is
an issue with network there
[743.08] then why can't he come
out and check his phone?
[748.02] But what do he care about me?
Aima must be with him there.
[751.82] Then why don't you go to
the hospital in place of Aima?
[755.14] -Me?
-Yes.
[758.12] Can't you go there?
[760.89] Mom, uncle is his maternal uncle.
[767.76] And she loves him like his real dad.
[772.43] And even uncle considers
her as her own daughter.
[776.76] She is her niece, but your
relation is no less than hers.
[783.32] He is your auntie's husband
and now your father in law too.
[786.52] -But still, mom.
-Didn't I tell you
[791.73] this is the time to win Zaid's heart.
[797.30] Go to Zaid. Go to the
hospital as his daughter in law.
[802.74] Support Zaid. Stand by him.
[805.40] I think you're right. I should go.
[809.17] Tell me one thing,
[811.60] whenever Zaid is tensed
why does he go to Aima?
[816.54] Think about it.
[819.55] Because they both are very good friends.
[822.59] No, because he gets
relieved when he goes to Aima.
[829.26] And that's the truth. It's Aima's wisdom
that she has made Zaid used to her.
[835.16] By supporting him in every problem.
[842.09] Remember one thing, dear,
[846.97] a man is always looking for peace.
[850.53] He wants to go to such a woman
where he can find his peace.
[858.29] No to someone who keeps
giving him tensions in any form.
[866.76] That's why, you go to Zaid.
[874.28] Get ready. I'll get something
made to eat, you can take it for Zaid.
[880.59] And listen,
[882.64] don't say anything there
which may make him tensed.
[886.49] Okay, mom.
[913.62] Thank God, Faiq, you're here.
[916.24] I was getting so worried, didn't
know who to share my problems with.
[922.30] I'm really worried about dad.
[924.84] You know, doctors have almost lost hope.
[928.62] Nosheen, no need to worry.
I am coming from the hospital.
[933.06] Zaid has told me that uncle is doing
fine now. He is just under observation.
[937.18] -Really?
-Yes.
[939.23] He can meet his family in a few hours.
[942.88] Okay, I'll go and inform
the rest of the family.
[946.54] I think Zaid has already told it to auntie.
[949.76] Oh, okay.
[951.57] You know, I haven't been out of my
room at all, just reciting Quran for him.
[958.42] -I came to meet you.
-Thank you so much, Faiq.
[962.83] You have so much consideration for my pain.
[967.46] Okay just wait, I'll get
something made for you to eat.
[971.43] No, I have already eaten.
[973.50] I just have a little headache
so please get me a cup of tea.
[977.24] -Okay, I'll tell them to make it.
-Thank you.
[997.52] Hello.
[1003.34] Hello? Who is this?
[1005.56] -Hello, who are you?
-You called, whom do you want to talk?
[1010.33] Actually I was calling my friend, but I
guess I have dialed a wrong number.
[1015.68] Please try not to repeat
this mistake, thank you.
[1039.21] What's up? Did someone call?
[1042.93] Yeah, some wrong number.
[1046.15] You have around 45 calls from
this number in your call log. Who is he?
[1050.51] Oh, one of those cheap guys
[1054.74] who have nothing else to do,
so they call people to tease them.
[1061.07] But you never told me about it.
[1063.43] I wasn't so important
that I should have told you.
[1068.01] It's just a wrong number, forget it.
[1070.54] DO one thing, give this number to me.
[1073.15] I have a friend in police, I'll
ask him to check who this guy is.
[1076.62] Just forget it, Faiq, no need for all
that. I'm just going to block him directly.
[1082.15] Besides, there are a hundred
other tensions, so what's the use?
[1086.76] See, I've done it.
[1088.68] Tea must be ready by
now, let me get it for you.
[1125.54] You must be tired.
[1129.25] No, I'm fine.
[1132.83] See, I'm back.
[1137.30] I didn't feel like staying home.
[1139.43] And you'll see uncle
will recover very soon.
[1147.62] Have you eaten since morning?
[1151.22] How can one think of
eating in such a situation?
[1155.40] Okay, come one, let's eat something. Come.
[1160.21] I'll be there in a while.
[1171.77] Aima, why don't you go
home? Take some rest.
[1176.52] I'm here with Zaid.
[1178.50] I'm not going anywhere leaving dad behind.
[1181.48] Dad, isn't alone. We are here with him.
[1187.92] I told you, I am not going
anywhere without taking dad with me.
[1191.74] Dad is...
[1194.77] inside the room.
[1197.02] And you are out here with Zaid.
[1199.28] Why don't you say that you
don't want to leave Zaid alone?
[1207.36] Driver is waiting outside,
you go home and take rest.
[1211.42] Besides, your mother is really worried too.
[1214.70] Go and console her a little.
[1326.43] Dad!
[1334.67] Dad, how are you doing now?
[1341.55] Dad, I got really worried
after knowing about your health.
[1351.70] But, thank God you seem much better to me.
[1358.98] You will recover soon with God's will.
[1366.01] Actually, brother, doctors
have forbidden dad to talk.
[1374.44] I know.
[1377.29] Dad is unhappy with me.
[1382.08] And he should be too.
[1385.07] I deserve it on what I did.
[1389.21] I have hurt you so much.
[1395.34] Brother, we'll talk
about these things later.
[1399.69] You're right.
[1403.81] A lot of time is
required for these things.
[1419.52] Take care of yourself, Dad.
[1424.43] We need you so much, Dad.
[1483.10] How dare you step
foot in my home?
[1486.38] Aunty, I want to talk to Zoya.
[1489.91] Zoya doesn't want to talk
to you, now go from here.
[1492.77] -Zoya, please listen to me just once.
-No!
[1497.57] Mom, let her speak. I want
to know what she has to say.
[1503.31] Zoya, believe me, I never
wanted this to happen.
[1507.85] Really? But still it has happened, Aima.
[1511.11] Just try to understand,
Zoya, I had no fault in it.
[1516.26] You had no fault in it, Zaid had
no fault in it, I think it was my fault.
[1522.79] Your marriage was called off, Faiq
cheated on you, your life was ruined.
[1529.96] So why did you punish me for that?
[1532.12] Why do I have to bear all this?
[1536.45] Besides, you didn't lose anything.
[1539.05] If Faiq left you then
Zaid got married to you.
[1542.34] Is this what love is?
[1546.20] This wasn't love, it was my compulsion.
[1549.88] Nobody is compelled to do so.
[1552.69] To make your own livelihood,
you ruined mine, Aima.
[1557.33] No, Zoya, that's not true. 
Why would I want to harm you?
[1564.31] -You are my friend, like my sister.
-Don;t you get tried of saying such things?
[1569.71] This friendship, love, it's nothing.
[1572.84] The only thing true in this world is
[1573.89] to think about yourself and
think of your own welfare.
[1575.80] -No, Zoya, I...
-Enough, enough.
[1581.08] Zoya, you go to your room.
[1584.16] This girl is too clever.
[1586.16] She is just trying to wheedle you
with her innocence to take you back.
[1590.60] I'm not a child, Mom. I know who
is my friend and who is my enemy.
[1596.05] And now I know it very well.
[1598.12] You know, Aima,
[1599.67] I had read it in stories only that
your friends stab you in your back.
[1604.62] But today I have seen it too.
[1609.42] Sorry, Mom,
[1613.29] you were right when you said that I
dam unable to recognize how others are.
[1617.37] I made a mistake.
[1618.68] And thank you, Aima, for
giving me this experience.
[1623.35] And this is what you
are being punished for.
[1625.96] Now you see?
[1629.33] Your love, your husband,
and she, your best friend
[1633.94] both of them have done
such a huge fraud with you.
[1636.86] Both of them proved to be such frauds.
[1638.76] Zoya, please believe me,
[1642.38] whatever that has happened, none of
us have done it happily or with our will.
[1648.49] Madam Aima, a marriage can't
take place without anybody's will.
[1651.64] And this marriage included yours and Zaid's
will, that’s why all this could happen.
[1656.84] The only cause do to so was my mother.
[1660.99] If I hadn't gotten married that night, my
mother wouldn't have been able to bear it.
[1668.31] I have bought my mother's life 
by getting married to Zaid.
[1673.06] Zoya, I know that I have hurt you a lot
[1677.66] and I am going to be
your culprit all my life.
[1681.15] Aima, I just don't understand
what you are trying to prove?
[1687.45] Do you want us to think
that you are innocent?
[1689.78] Or shall we celebrate all this?
Tell me, what is it?
[1695.95] No, I don't want anything like that.
[1699.30] Then what the hell do
you want from both of us?
[1702.27] I just want Zoya to return home
and forgive me and Zaid.
[1718.87] Which friend?
[1722.47] I have invited Sania.
[1724.72] What?
[1727.46] The same Sania whom you were taking
selfies with getting too close to her?
[1730.68] What if he minds it when he finds out.
[1733.79] What are you saying?
Which home? Whose son?
[1740.44] What does he has to do with
the problems of this home?
[1745.20] He has left this home, Zaid.
[1746.99] Now you guys should
prepare yourself to run around.
[1753.00] Sister, brother Azmat, you both
are going to be grand parents.
[1767.60] Yes, my Zoya is expecting.
