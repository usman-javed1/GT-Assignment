From flowers and from buds I have learned to bloom and be fragrant When I saw you I learned to chirp from you Anyway, I came to know that Zaid
met an accident? How is he doing now? What can I say, mom? He is in a bad shape since few days. Few days? But he had
an accident just today. I will not use any of my rights
even after being Zaid's wife. I promise you that. Please, just let me... let me live in your house. You are serving Zaid
with a lot of devotion. Yeah, he wasn't able to do his
tasks so I was just taking care of him. You weren't here as well. And you thought of making
the most of the opportunity, right? I'm showing you these pictures so
that you think about our honeymoon. Otherwise why would I show you
someone else's pictures? Okay, we will go but
it's not the right time. Sorry, Mom. I'm so sorry that I have taken such a
huge decision without letting you know. I know you don't like it. So sorry. Yes, I went to Zaid's house yesterday. He isn't well. Even you would have felt pity
for him if you saw his condition. Mom, he isn't well at all, and I have
also felt that he isn't happy without me. And yes, it was really
important for me to go there. Had I not gone there then... He would have died? Something like that. Stop this nonsense, Zoya. And you can fall for the
drama they are creating, not me. And nobody dies without anyone. Mothers die but her
children stay alive without her. Mom, please calm down.
At least try to understand me. Only if it's about Zaid. I can't listen to anything
regarding him calmly. It's not about Zaid, it's about me, Mom. Besides, in this period I have realized that he is not the only
one suffering, I am too. I love him. And I can;t live without him. And I have also realized that just being together with
each other is enough for us. And I won't leave him. Really? Do you guys
love each other so much? Then what is Aima doing in his life? If there is no place in his heart
for her then why is she there? -How is it possible?
-Why not? If he can remarry even after
being married, why can't he divorce? And this is much more practical then 
the thing you said about him dieing and all. Listen to me carefully, Zoya, I won't let you do such a huge blunder. You can go back on only one condition. IF Zaid divorces Aima, only then. Okay, Mom, just let me go there and see. 
If Aima... No ifs and buts. You have to promise me that you are going to convince
Zaid that he should divorce Aima. Only then can you go back. Fine. I am quite perplexed right now, and I don't want you to refuse me. What is it, Dad? Aima, I... As a father I... I want to ask you that you get married to Zaid. No, what are you saying, Dad? This...
this can't be. My dear, this is the need of the time. Dad, me and Zaid? No, this can't happen. -This can't happen.
-Try to understand me. -I am helpless.
-No, this can't be. I'm not the first girl in this world
whose marriage has been called off. This can't be, what's the worst that can
happen? My past is going to be stained. People are going to say things about me. Son, if I ask something from
you I hope you won't say no. Go ahead, Dad. I hope that you won't say no, Zaid. Dad, tell me without any hesitation what
can we do that we get rid of our tension. Zaid, I want you to marry Aima. Just to take revenge of your niece you have destroyed my son 
and my niece's marriage. How am I going to face my sister? This marriage isn't valid. Don't know what did you say to him, 
or threatened him that he agreed for this marriage. A marriage done forcefully isn't valid. If you don't believe me then go
ask anybody, this marriage isn't valid. And as far as your niece is
concerned, it was her fate. My Nosheen has no fault in it. Don't you understand such a simple thing? Your stubbornness has destroyed everything.
Our happiness. You are a murderer. You are responsible 
for all this destruction. My children, my children... You weren't even there when
your only daughter was leaving. She has left like an orphan. You didn't even give you her blessings
when she was leaving for her in laws. Zoya, I can't tell you how
happy I am that you are back. It seems like I have got a new life. When... when you had left my life had turned dark. I had lost all hope, Zoya. I hope that you won't disappoint me again. No, I swear, never. By the way, can I ask you something? What was it that made you come back? What kind of a question is this? No, I mean, what was 
the reason that you came back? That doesn't matter, Zaid. The important thing is that I am back. I was thinking if you
could say it yourself that you have come back for me because
you love me, then I would have liked it. What is it? What are you thinking? Nothing, I was just thinking if the decision to come back
to you is even right or not. Listen, Zaid, I won't be able to trust you like earlier. You're right. I have actually lost your trust. Don't do anything in future
which makes me regret my decision. Never, I swear, never again. I will never take any
decision that hurts you. Nor will I let anybody
make such a decision. It's a promise and I won't let it break. -Promise.
-I hope so. I wanted to thank you, dear. -Thank me?
-You took a step for the betterment of this house. I didn't get you, Dad. Aima, you have convinced
Zoya to come back, didn't you? Good, I'm proud of you. By doing this you have again
displayed your generosity. You have proven how large-hearted you are. Otherwise if it was some other girl in your
place she would have been happy, celebrated that his husband's first wife has
left but you have done a great thing. You are a girl full of character. You initiated in this matter
and brought Zoya back home. -Dad, I did what I felt was better.
-Certainly. I want that you and Zoya 
accept each other sincerely. When you and Zoya will stay happy with
each other then Zaid will be at peace too. I will try my best. Zaid has recovered very quickly 
after his accident. Yeah, thank God. Yeah, and your care that
you did for him day and night. I know that Zoya is back but still I would like that
even after he gets better you shouldn't stop taking care of Zaid. And keep doing his tasks like you do. Don't take me wrong, I'm saying this because a
man only loves that woman, likes that woman who takes care of him. Girls these days don't even make
a cup of tea for their husbands and expect that they give their lives
for them. It doesn't happen this way. You are wise, do you get what I'm saying? Just keep taking care of him as a friend. What's wrong? Dad, at least he considered
me something earlier. He doesn't even consider me 
as his friend now. No, no, it's not like that. He got very upset when Zoya left. He was like that with everyone. Now that she is back, 
he will accept you too. Not only as a friend, 
but as a wife as well. Just give him some time, dear. I want nothing else from Zaid, Dad. It's enough for me if he
just accepts me as his friend. What are you saying? Is it wise 
to let go of you rights? Zaid is a responsible person.
He will definitely fulfill your rights. Yes, Dad. Everything is going to be fine,
dear. This is life, it keeps changing. Please get ma a cup of tea, 
I'm having a headache. Forgive me please. What are you doing, auntie? You are embarrassing me. And look, I have no complains with anyone. I have accepted it as my fate. But, honestly I tried my best 
but I couldn't fight for you. It's all right, auntie. 
It was just bad timing. We can't do anything about that. It's your greatness
that you are saying that, otherwise had it been
someone else in your place,  she wouldn't even want to look at me. But you guys honored me, called
me to your home, sat with me. Please, auntie, it's nothing like that. 
You are still my auntie. Shabana, to tell you the truth 
I envy your upbringing. I always said, and I say it even today, she is one in a million. Sister, it's not my
credit, it's God's gift. No doubt, you are right. Come in. Where is Zaid? Anything you want? Yeah, I got this for him. Keep it here. He is in the washroom, 
will be just back. He is supposed to take his
afternoon medicine with milk. evening medicine at 6:00 pm 
and then before going to bed. All his medicine course is complete just a few more days left for his
medicines which are very important. And you can ask me anything if you want. Were you giving Zaid his
medicines all these days? Yeah, he is supposed to
take his medicines on time. So dad gave me this responsibility,
that is why I was giving him his medicines. It's okay, Aima. I am just asking. 
Why are you getting scared? Okay, tell him to take his medicines. I'm
going in the kitchen, I've got some work to do. How are you feeling now? I'm better. Aima, please tell everyone that me
and Zaid are going out for dinner tonight. Okay. How are you feeling now? Much better. Oh, where has 
the moon risen from today? -Amber, I know you are
angry with me, that's why I... First tell me why have you come here? It's my sister's house, 
why won't I come? Sister? What sister? -Amber, what are you saying?
-I am telling the truth. You have destroyed this relation. You should consider your sister as dead. For God's sake, Amber. Are you going to end
this relationship over such a small thing? Small thing? You have destroyed my daughter's
marriage and it is a small thing for you? What's wrong, Amber, get hold of
yourself. I didn't mean it that way. What did you mean then? Tell me? Had it happened with
your daughter, would you consider it a small
thing for you even then? Amber, I didn't mean to say that. I know
that it has been really unfair with Zoya. Come here, please. Sit with me. I have come here to clarify all 
the misunderstanding that are between us. Misunderstanding? You think getting your
son married again is a misunderstanding? I mean whatever happened with Zoya is very
wrong. I have come to apologize to you. Wow, you thought of it so soon. You should have rested,
waited for a while and then come. Amber, it has been really unfair with Zoya,
and your anger is valid. But it's not right to
end relations like this. And what about you? What you did was right? What did I do, Amber? All this was
because of Azmat and Zaid agreed for it. I got to know when they
both had gotten married. What would have I done then, Amber? You tell me, being my sister
did you talk to me for once even, or contacted me? Your daughter in law left home
and came here, but what did you do? Just maneuvered things in your favor. Amber, you know how Azmat is. Don't you dare, don't you dare
talk about your husband to me. I know very well how your husband is.
And now I know your son too how he is. Right now I am just asking you
that what did you do being my sister? Let me tell you what you did. You supported your husband 
and your son only. You didn't even care to check up 
on your sister and niece. So that's why we don't have any relation,
any connection whatsoever. -Greetings, Mom.
-Greetings. Just great, people used to wait for us before
having tea, and now they don't even care. It's nothing like that. I just had no idea
that you are getting back home directly. Mom, where am I going to go if not my home? You should have visited you in laws. -In laws? Why?
-Because your wife has gone there. Faiq, is everything all right? -Didn't she tell you before leaving?
-No, Mom, I think she had called me. I was so busy with the restaurant
work and then I couldn't call her back. By the way, when did she leave? She woke up at noon. And after that she left. Anyways, what's for dinner? I'm really sorry, dear. I thought
you would have dinner there. That's why I cooked bitter gourd for myself. If you want something I can make it. No, it's okay. Mom, I want to talk to you about something. Actually, Nosheen wants to take
over the responsibility of kitchen, so I want you to give her a chance. It's great if she wants to cook for you. Not just for me. I mean, I want
her to take responsibility of chores. I can cook my own food. But if she wants to cook
anything for you then she must. Mom, I want you to take a
break from kitchen chores. I know how much you care about me. But first ask your wife if she is willing
to take responsibility of the house or not. And as far as my tasks are concerned, you
know it well that I do all my tasks myself. Faiq, if you want to give her
any responsibility of the house then you can do it happily. -Okay I'll just go and freshen up.
-All right. Amber I didn't come in front
of you out of embarrassment. Really? How is your
embarrassment decreased now? Has everything turned back 
like it was before? Amber, what can I say? Look, Amber, our kids
have reconciled as well. Not our. It's just my daughter 
who has forgiven your son. But I don't have such a
big heart, understand? I am going to remember it all my
life how you people have treated me. Don't you remember how
your daughter threatened me? I know that my daughter
is very rude, Amber. Rude? That is a very small word for her. Your daughter is of low character. Please Amber, don't say that. 
She is your niece. She will be my niece if you are my sister. But you aren't my sister. You are just my daughter's
mother in law now. And it would be better that we meet
as that relation whenever we meet. Punish me as much as you want, but please, don't say anything about
ending our relationship, please. Look, what's done is done, and
everything is normal again now. -Nothing is normal.
-What do you want then? Even Zoya has accepted Aima. She has gone back to your
home just because of Zaid otherwise she doesn't accept this relationship at all. Do you actually want that
we become sisters again? -Yeah, Amber, of course.
-It's possible on one condition only that you remove Aima from Zoya's way. From now on, you won't go
anywhere without asking me. You will go only if you have my
or mom's permission otherwise not. I went to my Mama's
not to meet any boyfriend. -Aima is joining office from tomorrow.
-Okay. She is starting work, this means
that everything is normal at home. I think you shouldn't delay
joining office anymore. -You tell me how can I keep everyone happy?
-Zaid, you don't need to keep everyone happy. Just keep Zoya happy. Even I wanted that. But it isn't possible in this situation.
