[0.15] From flowers and from buds
[4.59] I have learnt to bloom and be fragrant
[9.35] When I saw you
[14.18] {\an8}I learnt how to chirp from you
[19.17] Marrying someone with my own will is my
right and it's your responsibility...
[24.77] I just stopped myself before hitting you
today, don't you dare say that again.
[30.26] Or else I won't stop then, understand?
[32.90] Have you ever asked Nosheen,
[36.43] where she goes, when she
goes and why she goes?
[43.85] Your dad isn't even ready
to hire him as a peon.
[47.43] Duh, just because his shop
turned to a factory in fluke,
[50.36] {\an8}he thinks everyone else is a peon?
[53.92] {\an8}Behave yourself, Nosheen, he is your dad.
[57.12] Well, I am her daughter as well.
[58.47] Tell him if it isn't Faisal,
there is going to be no one else.
[61.27] Are you in your senses, Nosheen?
[64.56] I am in my senses, but bringing others
to their senses these days.
[69.27] Just listen to me with a cool mind.
[72.77] May be the family that's coming today
 are people like you wanted.
[77.11] I am not interested
 in the family but Faisal.
[79.74] What do I have to do with the family?
[83.38] Dear, everything has got
 to do with the family.
[87.79] Guys do what their family
teaches them to do.
[90.87] Mother, don't confuse me
with useless things.
[93.41] I am sure dad would like
someone rigid like himself.
[97.09] Then how should I tell you to get serious?
[100.48] I'm very serious, Mother,
but with Faisal only.
[104.78] You will lose all this seriousness
if I'll slap you twice.
[111.41] Okay, it's final now. They are coming
 in the evening. Behave yourself.
[117.84] And if your dad and I like them,
then we will fix your marriage.
[122.29] It might be possible
that you guys like them,
[126.90] but what if they don't like
me for any reason, then?
[132.88] Nosheen, you are so adamant and stubborn.
[136.74] Oh, God, what sin
 am I being punished for, in your form.
[140.62] Don't know what sort of an upstart
he is for whom you are fighting so much.
[144.72] -Mother, show a little respect please.
-Oh, showing us how to respect.
[148.92] You don't respect your own father
and telling to respect me some stranger?
[151.95] Faisal isn't some stranger, we know
each other since a year, and I love him.
[157.82] Had he been so crazy after you,
he would have sent you a proposal by now.
[164.08] He is ready.
[166.88] How much does he earn, how is his family,
[169.01] how are the people, one has
to check all these things.
[171.52] He is still studying, and I don't know
about the family. They must be good.
[176.23] -Show me his picture.
-Give me your phone, I'll show you.
[195.12] For God's sake,
[199.91] my ill fate is just like
his hideous picture.
[203.09] Mother, I haven't asked you to criticize.
[206.38] Just get ready. I am going to support
your dad in whatever decision he takes.
[213.91] I am enough for myself.
[230.49] -Don't you like Kinza either?
- No.
[235.10] Well I thought you won't because
Zoya doesn't like her that much.
[239.16] And whenever I mention her,
why do you make a long face?
[243.94] No... it's nothing like that.
[248.00] Neither I like her, nor I find her bad.
[253.36] Okay tell me, how do you find
our chemistry, you know, as a couple?
[259.68] I am asking you because those who are
in love, everything seems perfect to them.
[264.89] So, at times it's important
to take an outsider's opinion.
[269.37] Aima.
[272.31] Aima, dear... Oh, God...
[279.64] -Aima.
-Yes. Mother?
[283.77] What... what's wrong?
[288.19] Leave it, are you crying?
[291.21] -Did someone hurt you again?
-It's nothing, Mother.
[294.71] I know, I know who could have done it.
[298.37] My child, Sister and Nosheen have
nothing else to do than to hurt you.
[303.81] The don't have a beautiful heart like your.
[307.83] What else can they do?
[310.64] The qualities you have got,
 they don't have it.
[313.98] Just don't get hurt, okay.
[317.62] You shouldn't take
 anything they say to your heart, okay?
[320.75] I don't take anything said
by anyone to my heart if it's about me.
[327.15] But I don't know what happens to me,
[329.94] if anybody says anything about you,
I just can't tolerate it, my child.
[334.06] Mother, please don't worry.
[336.38] And look you got me busy in talking to you,
[338.54] Zaid is going to ask after a while,
"Aima have you ironed my shirt yet or not?"
[345.79] -"Aima, is my shirt ready yet?"
-See, did you just see that?
[351.06] Have to do all his work, as if
I am his slave. Getting it!
[376.17] Hello. Yes, Azmat Hussain here.
[381.35] Yes, Mr. Khalid, I have recognized you.
Greetings, how are you doing?
[386.68] Yes, I had asked you
 to look for a proposal.
[391.58] Whenever it's easy for you.
[394.43] Sure, fine, no problem at all.
[397.31] Thank you, thank you,
I will be waiting for you. God bye.
[417.94] What happened? Isn't Zaid back yet?
[421.37] Is he going to have a lunch
and dinner date both?
[425.32] No idea.
[427.35] I just don't get what Zaid saw in Kinza.
[431.59] Was she the only one to fall
 in love with? I detest her.
[436.55] Don't know what he saw in her.
[438.47] Zoya, I can't say
anything about this.
[442.16] What sort of an answer is this?
[445.02] Tell me something, do you find
Kinza and Zaid's couple okay?
[450.13] I seriously have no idea about it, Zoya.
[455.79] Zaid knows better what he is doing.
[459.02] Aima, what sort
 of weird answers are you giving?
[461.97] -You should be more concerned about Zaid.
-What do you mean?
[465.61] Aima, we both are his best friends,
[467.68] if we are not worried about
him who else would be?
[469.88] Now, look, how worried I am about him.
[475.15] Aren't you?
[477.62] And just imagine, if she is that
typical kind of a girl, okay,
[481.21] and she has issues with our friendship,
[483.93] and she asks him to leave us,
aren't you worried about that?
[489.52] Yes, that's true.
[491.42] If Kinza or any other girl
tries to spoil our friendship,
[494.94] then we... we will going
to end their relationship.
[500.85] Aima, Aima, what's wrong?
[506.08] -Nothing.
-Why are you crying then? Tell me.
[512.69] Just some domestic issues.
[516.71] Mother isn't well.
[522.84] Auntie and Nosheen's behaviour.
[528.44] I just feel like crying at times.
[532.86] I feel like...
[536.26] things are getting out of control.
[539.93] Oh, God, for once I thought you
were crying for Zaid.
[544.50] Aima, everything will be fine, okay?
[551.25] Do you want me to talk to them?
[555.09] I just don't understand why
she behaves with you like this.
[560.54] And Nosheen is really rude.
[563.71] No, don't get involved
 in this matter at all.
[567.21] I'll handle it myself.
[569.55] Okay, as you wish.
[572.34] Okay listen, since you aren't
able to attend the lectures,
[576.92]  I am going to record
the lectures for you, okay?
[582.44] -Thank you.
-But you idiot, you scared me.
[585.84] Whatever it is, you can share it with me.
[593.33] Check it, may be it's Zaid's.
[602.53] -Who is it?
-I don't know Zoya.
[605.49] I got a message earlier
from this number as well, saying hello.
[608.67] I didn't respond to it then.
[610.53] And now there are so many messages,
coming from this number.
[613.32] He knows my name too.
[616.13] Give this number to me, I'll call him.
[618.00] And if its is some cheapster,
I am going to hit him.
[621.76] I think just forget it.
We shouldn't pay heed to such people.
[626.40] They become a nuisance.
[628.33] What if it is someone I know.
 I'll take care of it myself.
[632.98] Yes you  are right,
[635.41] Okay, listen, I'll get going now.
[637.22] Don't know when Zaid is going
to be back, so see you.
[641.13] -Bye.
-Bye.
[647.44] -Zaid, Zaid...
-Yes, mother?
[651.16] What is this? I'm sure
Aima must have given it to you.
[656.77] No, what are you doing? Give it back.
There is a thing called privacy.
[662.01] Oh, you kids.
Who is Kinza? A friend or...
[667.15] Yes, she is a friend. What is it?
[670.40] Well, it's your dad's order that you stay
home as we are expecting some guests.
[676.40] Guests?
[677.91] Yes, some people are coming
for Nosheen's proposal.
[681.65] What do mean for her proposal?
 It isn't the right age for her to get married,
[683.69] she hasn't even completed
her university yet.
[685.86] Your dad thinks that Nosheen
is getting out of hands.
[691.98] Don't know what dad keeps thinking,
didn't you try to stop him?
[694.38] How could I stop him?
Does he ever listen to me?
[697.51] And he never asks for my opinion either.
[699.25] Honestly, I have no idea
what is going on in this house.
[702.48] Why were you talking to aunt so rudely?
[706.11] No, it's nothing, just like that.
[708.29] Oh, really? So are you going
 to hide things from me now too?
[711.63] Why did I become unwanted
[715.91] Nobody knows that
[720.88] Why did I become unwanted
[725.54] Nobody knows that
[730.24] After Hammad has left, you are
the elder one in this house,
[733.49] -so take a little interest now.
-Yeah right, who listens to me here?
[737.70] For that you will have
to get a little serious.
[740.83] If you behave like an elder
then people will consider you as an elder.
[745.57] And if you feel that dad is doing something
wrong, then you should tell him.
[752.14] Advise him. And this way his dictation
in this house would reduce a bit.
[760.19] -Okay.
-This is a house not his factory
[763.16] that he just gives an order
and everybody gets on fulfilling it.
[766.93] Okay, fine , Mother. I am going
to talk to dad about it.
[770.27] Talk to him when the people
who are bringing Nosheen's proposal leave.
[775.71] All right.
[777.28] -By the way how does this Kinza look like?
-Please, Mother, stop irritating me, please.
[801.11] What is it?
[803.07] I am seeing you reading
a news paper for the first time.
[806.21] couldn't you find anything else to read?
[808.64] What else should I do then? Should I
become a news anchor on some news channel?
[814.86] I am bored of staying at home.
 No college, no phone?
[818.10] It would be better if I commit suicide.
[821.80] Stop this nonsense,
I have to talk to you about something.
[825.60] What is it? Has your husband
put any more sanctions on me?
[829.98] Oh, stop being so dramatic.
[832.79] -Some people are coming.
-What people.
[835.52] To meet you.
[837.38] Mother, if you guys want me
to create mischief let me know.
[842.13] -What are you going to do?
-I don't know.
[844.11] But whatever I am going to do
 it might make your life hell.
[848.51] Oh, God!
[849.65] Mother I have already told you clearly
my point of view on this issue.
[852.74] Nosheen, look,
they are just coming to meet you.
[855.72] That doesn't meet that you
are going to get married there.
[858.48] So just to satisfy your dad,
 sit with them for a while.
[862.06] And during that we
 are going to find some solution.
[866.57] I don't believe you, Mother.
[869.13] Don't you trust your mother?
[871.20] Obviously, you are playing
a double game with me.
[874.92] What do you mean?
[875.90] You are allowing the proposals
coming through dad too
[877.98] and you have asked auntie
for my proposals as well.
[883.22] What does that mean? That you want me to
get out of this house as soon as possible.
[888.18] Oh, you silly girl.
[890.34] I had no other solution
to give to your dad.
[895.13] And as far as your marriage is concerned,
I won't let it happen without your consent.
[903.04] Hmm?
[904.18] Okay, listen, I have asked Zaid
to be after your dad as well.
[908.42] He is also going to talk to him
on this topic and try to stop it.
[912.76] Oh, stop it, Mother, my brother
is least bothered about me.
[915.80] Just Aima is dear to him.
[917.20] You both are going to die fighting one day.
[920.64] He isn't that negative
 about you as much as you are.
[924.32] -Really?
-I'm telling you the truth.
[926.32] He was taking your side
in front if your dad as well,
[929.19] he said he is going to talk to him.
[930.58] So, please don't be so negative, Nosheen.
[933.50] Okay, sorry.
[935.05] Your son is great and I am not going
to talk against him ever.
[940.08] Okay, good.
[941.32] Now you will try to be
friends with your brother,
[944.95] So that the people in between
 don't get a chance to gather sympathy.
[949.46] And you know what people
in between am I talking about?
[953.88] Yes, I have that much sense.
[956.52] Okay now carry on reading
 your newspaper, all right?
[969.98] Come on, sister, I am not a matchmaker.
[973.95] that you ask me to find a proposal
and I'll send you several options.
[977.39] Okay, I'll talk to you later.
[979.55] Right now I was discussing
something important with Zoya.
[983.90] Yes.
[987.91] -What's up, Mother?
-Nothing.
[992.96] Why were you talking to Aunt
 so rudely then?
[996.55] No, it's nothing, just like that.
[998.75] Really, so now you are going
to hide things from me, too.
[1003.65] What would I hide,
there is nothing as such.
[1007.22] You aren't telling either.
[1009.41] Nosheen, was really rude
to me the other day.
[1015.10] Actually, sister was asking me
to look for a proposal for her.
[1021.40] She is very rude.
[1022.93] I am not going to
tolerate her misbehavior.
[1025.56] And sister must have an idea
about it after talking to me right now.
[1032.69] She was asking me, " What did you do,
did you find any proposal for her?"
[1038.25] So, are you going to find a proposal
 for her even after her behaviour?
[1043.98] No, not at all.
[1045.63] I don't want to get involved
 in any matter of such a rude girl.
[1050.02] Why don't you tell aunt that?
[1052.55] She must also know
how ruder her daughter is.
[1056.16] And that's the reason,
you are not looking for a proposal for her.
[1058.64] She knows it very well,
she is aware of everything.
[1063.35] I just don't say it myself
because I'm afraid she would mind.
[1068.34] After all, she is my only sister.
[1074.79] Anyway, forget it.
[1077.26] ell me, what were we talking about?
[1081.56] We were talking
about Nosheen's misbehavior.
[1083.71] We were talking about your proposals.
[1088.18] Oh, yes. I have rejected two of them,
[1091.90] and the one left, I would like to meet him.
[1096.44] You are so selective in your choices.
[1102.33] But at times, I feel you are too confident.
[1106.25] Or, maybe over confident.
[1109.12] Mom, I'm smart.
[1114.48] Okay, tell me who is he?
[1119.45] Faizan.
[1123.45] Well, he is a catch,
his father is a colonel,
[1127.40] mother is a designer,
and he himself is foreign qualified.
[1131.80]  Mom, would you please stop promoting him?
[1135.68] Okay, then, should I invite his family?
[1140.44] Mom, these aren't the 80s,
[1142.32] that his family will come, we all will have
tea together, everyone will meet each other,
[1146.13] I want to meet him alone.
[1148.06] You can meet him
when he comes with his family.
[1153.25] Mom, I want to meet him alone,
 look at him, understand him.
[1157.65] And if things work out then okay,
[1160.30] and if I don't like him then it ends there.
[1162.77] Just ask him to meet me.
[1186.22] Hey, you know I have been looking for
you all over, and you are sitting here.
[1191.00] And why don't you have your phone with you?
[1196.24] By the way, what are you
 doing here at this hour?
[1199.63] Why? Can't I sit here?
[1203.37] I just felt like being alone,
that's why came here.
[1207.71] Are we fighting again?
Is everything all right?
[1212.93] No, we are not fighting at all.
[1216.23] Anyway, tell me what you wanted to say?
[1220.43] Not to say, I came to ask.
[1223.25] -What?
-That are you worried about me or not?
[1226.98] Worried for what?
[1228.51] I mean, I went on a dater today.
What happened? How did it go?
[1233.78] You know that I am not at peace
 until I tell you each and every detail.
[1237.32] But no, you are least interested.
[1241.37] It was such a special day for me.
[1243.68] Sorry, Zaid, it's just that I am a little
disturbed these days.
[1249.59] -What happened? Because of Auntie's health?
-Obviously.
[1253.43] Aima, I have told you just don't worry,
we all are here to take care of auntie,
[1257.86] to spend time with her.
[1259.40] And if she wants
we can also take her to the hospital.
[1261.94] And I had talked to her, she said
she is feeling well, so just chill.
[1271.12] Okay, now listen to all the details,
or else my stomach ache won't end.
[1275.61] Okay, then tell me how did it go?
[1279.68] What should I tell?
[1283.03] -You know, I broke one of my rules today.
-What rule?
[1289.59] Kinza is such a lively person, that
when she felt thirsty,
[1293.15] she told me to stop the car and have
sugar cane juice from a street vendor,
[1295.93] and made me drink it as well.
[1297.58] And you know I don't drink
anything from these random places,
[1300.56] but couldn't say no to her.
[1306.03] Zaid, shall I ask you something?
[1308.71] Is she as serious about you as you are?
[1311.18] Brother, since the say dad has
stopped me from going to college,
[1315.06] all my routine is disturbed.
[1317.31] Hmm.
[1319.71] Brother, please talk to dad to get
me re-admitted to the college.
[1325.06] Why did I become unwanted
[1329.60] Nobody knows that
[1334.23] Why did I become unwanted
[1338.83] Nobody knows that
[1343.65] Oh yes, we both feel the same way.
[1347.93] You know, you know she told me that
[1351.52] she is unable to sleep without me, then I
also said that I am restless without you.
[1359.29] Hours turn into minutes with her.
I lose track of time.
[1366.41] I feel...
[1368.94] I feel that I am falling in love with her.
[1377.99] I am telling you such romantic things,
at least give me some response.
[1380.99] No, I... I'm listening.
[1383.43] Just listening is not enough,
show some expressions as well.
[1388.76] You know, Zoya is meeting
a guy too, tomorrow.
[1392.83] Really? Why?
[1394.37] -Why does one meet a guy?
-Really? She didn't even tell me.
[1398.82] She called me just a while ago.
[1402.08] And it's not a date,
you can say it's an arranged date.
[1405.91] That guy had sent a proposal for Zoya.
[1408.72] That's amazing. This mean all three
of our fates are moving parallel.
[1413.36] We three were single few days a ago,
and see now...
[1416.90] Why don't you look for a guy, too. We will
get married together on the same venue.
[1420.33] End of story.
[1428.28] Aima, what is it?
[1433.52] Aima, look here towards me.
[1436.46] Aima.
[1439.40] What is it? Tell me.
[1440.99] I told you that I am worried about mother.
[1444.97] Don't lie to me.
I know it's not about aunt, tell me.
[1448.40] Why would I lie to you?
[1450.24] No you aren't telling the truth,
I want to know it. Tell me right now.
[1454.87] Why are you crying?
[1461.00] Zaid...
[1466.04] I like you.
[1473.28] I really like you a lot.
[1479.82] And not since now, since long ago.
[1484.87] I love you so much.
[1493.12] Aima...
[1498.82] -What?
-What happened, you didn't answer my question.
[1502.60] I am worried because
of the environment of the house.
[1508.12] What happened at home, Aima?
[1510.33] Zaid, these days , auntie
 and Nosheen are behaving very rudely.
[1515.94] -With you?
-With mother too.
[1519.98] I just worry that, what if they say
something that mother takes to her heart.
[1530.32] That's why I'm really disturbed.
I just don't know how to handle all this.
[1537.09] Aima, how would I know
all this if you don't tell me.
[1543.33] It just didn't feel right
 to tell you all this.
[1546.96] What is right or wrong about it?
[1550.49] Because they are your mother and sister.
[1552.97] So what? I am going to talk to mother.
[1554.82] No, Zaid. Please don't even think about it.
[1557.69] That's the reason I didn't tell you.
[1560.31] But why, Aima?
 I can't let anyone hurt you in any way.
[1565.06] Zaid, you are not going to talk
 to anybody, understood?
[1568.92] -Reason?
-Because this isn't right.
[1572.19] Aunt and Nosheen would feel
that I have complained about them to you.
[1575.83] Aima, Aima, please stop being so childish.
[1578.61] I am talking sensibly, Zaid,
you are getting emotional.
[1582.00] Seriously, please.
[1584.76] -That's why I am saying, try to understand.
-What should I understand, Aima?
[1590.19] That with your interference
the issue can aggravate.
[1594.64] Means, Nosheen and mother can do whatever
they want and we should just stay quiet?
[1598.52] Because it would be of no use
even if you talk to them.
[1601.65] Look if she had any fear, she would have
been afraid of dad that we won't tell him.
[1606.09] But it isn't like that.
[1608.76] Anyways, cheer up.
[1612.52] I'm fine.
[1614.18] You, know I'm feeling good now.
[1618.16] Why is that?
[1619.51] May be because I shared my problem
with you. I am relaxed now.
[1627.08] At least smile now.
[1629.63] By the way, I have another
way to reduce stress.
[1634.32] Really? And what is that?
[1637.22] Slaps. You can slap me a couple of times.
[1643.47] -I am going to slap real hard.
-Yeah, sure, go on.
[1652.90] During your phone call I
realized that you are angry with me,
[1655.85] so, I have come to appease you.
[1658.82] To tell you the truth, I really didn't like
the way Nosheen talked to me.
[1664.25] I know, she is and idiot.
[1667.13] And she has been really
rebellious these days.
[1669.44] I apologize on her behalf.
[1672.41] Oh, come on. What are you doing?
[1676.61] I have no complains with you.
[1678.57] Thank God, or else I was worried
[1681.35] that if my only sister gets angry with
me who am I going to bewail my troubles to.
[1688.78] Just don't mind what Nosheen says.
 Kids these days are just like that.
[1693.40] No, sister, that's no excuse.
Nosheen is not a kid.
[1699.25] And being young isn't related
to rudeness or politeness.
[1705.17] My daughter is young too.
[1707.24] But Zoya knows it very well
how to respect elders.
[1712.83] Has she ever misbehaved with your?
[1715.89] No she hasn't.
[1719.86] Sister, let me give you an
advice, please don't mind,
[1725.94] Nosheen really needs your attention.
[1730.82] You want her to get married
as soon as possible,
[1733.40] so, you know it very well how important
it is to have patience in it.
[1740.15] Or else a marriage can't sustain.
[1742.90] -Am I wrong?
-No, you are right.
[1747.27] Actually, she has taken after her paternal
aunt, that's why she is like that.
[1751.90] No, sister, I disagree
with you here as well.
[1756.40] Shabana is a very soft- natured lady.
[1761.20] And Aima isn't rude like Nosheen at all.
[1765.02] In fact she has a very soft nature as well.
[1768.49] She isn't rude at least.
[1770.87] Now you are degrading Nosheen.
[1776.59] I know, sister that you
don't like that girl at all.
[1779.98] But whatever I am saying is the truth.
[1783.21] I admit that Nosheen did wrong.
[1785.94] She was really irritated
and agitated that day.
[1789.94] Anyway, I was telling all this
to you for your own benefit.
[1794.31] In fact Nosheen has to go to
another house after marriage,
[1797.61] if her temperament and behaviour remains
the same, who is going to tolerate it?
[1803.05] Anyway, forget it. Tell me what would
you like to have, tea, coffee?
[1806.48] In fact, it's dinner time. Dinner will be
served in a while, we'll have it together.
[1841.40] Who are you and what do you want?
[1933.19] I'll get the movie tickets,
we can watch the night show.
[1937.36] Okay, listen, give me two minutes,
I'll call you back.
[1942.07] You, at this hour?
[1944.14] Yes, I was hungry, so I thought
 to give you some snacks too.
[1953.10] Don't worry brother, I haven't
listened to anything you said.
[1957.18] -Remain in your limits.
-I was just kidding.
[1959.93] Why are you still up?
[1962.10] Brother, since the day dad has
stopped me from going to college,
[1965.98] all my routine is disturbed.
[1970.60] Please talk to dad to get me
re-admitted to the college.
[1976.73] Firstly, dad doesn't listen to me.
[1979.59] And secondly?
[1980.95] And secondly, do you have
any idea what you have done?
[1985.02] -What have I done?
-What do you mean what have you done?
[1988.79] Staying away from home till midnight,
being friends with all sorts of people,
[1993.41] Really? You are talking as if
you are a saint yourself.
[2002.62] I am well aware, you have done
all this more than I have.
[2006.93] Behave yourself. You are forgetting,
 I am still your elder brother.
[2010.67] Okay, okay, sorry.
I am just saying that everyone does it.
[2017.15] -Listen, it's it's different, okay?
-Really? Is it different?
[2021.04] What sort of a reason is this?
[2024.09] Boys can do whatever they want, and girls
should stay confined in the house?
[2030.23] Don't you start this
useless argument with me.
[2033.13] No, not so easily, brother.
Tell me, why are men so dual-faced?
[2043.27] Why did I become unwanted
[2047.84] Nobody knows that
[2052.58] Why did I become unwanted
[2057.17] Nobody knows that
[2062.03] It's the same guy who
messaged me the other day.
[2065.23] He has been sending me messages since
last night, I have just had it with him.
[2068.95] -Who is it?
-I don't know.
[2073.03] So, what is he saying?
[2086.94] I had some complains from you.
[2089.82] You know that I don't keep
anything to my heart.
[2094.06] Is everything all right , dear?
[2095.48] A family came to meet me,
 you must know about it.
