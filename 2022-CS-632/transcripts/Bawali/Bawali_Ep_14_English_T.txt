[0.04] Son, those
[1.28] relationships which cannot bear the burden of truth, it is better to break them,
[7.28] but the soul will not be able to tolerate this, it would be an
[11.48] injustice to her, mother, they have come to
[16.36] take back the jewellery that they had given, where are the jewellery,
[24.68] bring it here, give me aunt
[28.52] also bring the baby inside, it is time for her fit, come
[36.08] quickly, yes, yes come
[40.89] [music],
[53.96] inform all those who were cut off from the wedding that the marriage has been cancelled,
[55.84] and what reason should I tell, that crazy
[58.60] daughter-in-law of our house has come back, right, come
[62.28] shut up, I told you, I feel that
[65.36] you have changed, you are right,
[68.28] maybe I have changed,
[72.28] earlier I was only your wife and love,
[77.44] and even now you are my wife
[81.04] and love, you know
[84.28] how much I love you, it is
[86.68] natural for you to get angry, but what will happen by doing all this,
[89.32] very good, you are spending your life peacefully by playing such a big joke with me,
[94.52] I should not say anything, but tomorrow is our marriage,
[97.08] tomorrow's marriage and day after tomorrow's marriage, now everything is
[100.84] over  But I am not able to understand anything right now, my
[105.12] mind is not working,
[109.00] Amma ya Allah,
[111.36] well what
[113.20] happened, tell me something, what happened? What
[117.48] happened?
[120.20] It was Eson's call, yes it was Eson's call, what
[124.24] happened? Tell me the whole story, what happened,
[128.24] Amma, what happened is it okay, Arup broke up with me?
[132.64] Ami, Arup has come back, she has also recovered and
[138.84] Roop has come back, so then there will be no
[141.52] Nikah now.
[146.66] [Music]
[151.80] Okay,
[152.88] okay, look, there must be some blessing from Allah in this also,
[157.08] and why are you crying,
[161.00] we have not made any loss-making deal,
[163.76] you have become the owner of the flat,
[166.60] right, Ami, in this whole matter, my father died,
[172.16] my marriage was stopped,
[175.28] you are telling me that I should be happy for a flat.
[179.92] [Music]
[189.76] What does father's death have to do with this whole matter,
[192.20] this girl has gone mad.
[195.56] [Music]
[203.92] So I don't know dad, when will everything be fine in my life,
[211.24] son, it is in the trials
[213.88] and mistakes of life that a person's character and
[216.88] understanding is revealed,
[218.40] and
[220.44] maybe this is also his test, I am
[225.00] tired, but now
[228.56] dad, if not today, then tomorrow  Roop will come to know
[232.96] that I was getting married to Fara
[237.60] and then the same thing will start, the same
[241.12] husband-wife
[244.60] fights, son, your marriage with Fara was just a
[247.40] compromise and I think Urub will
[252.32] definitely understand this, but who will explain it to her, who will tell
[255.52] her, who will
[258.32] explain all this, son, you will tell, you
[262.76] explain and son, remember one thing in life,
[268.16] these
[270.72] business relationships, tricks work in them,
[276.00] but these relationships of love, one should not be mocked at,
[283.96] but
[285.08] dad, sometimes too much truth and too
[287.88] much straightforwardness also become the reason for breaking of relationships,
[292.88] son, those
[295.24] relationships which cannot bear the burden of truth, it is better if they break,
[301.08] but if Roo will not be able to tolerate it, it will be an excess
[309.96] with her, tell me one thing, are
[312.68] you worried about Urup's tolerance
[318.04] or do you not have the courage to speak the truth,
[326.40] what are you thinking now,
[331.24] look son, do not think too much, if you
[333.32] think too much then tricks will
[336.76] come to the mind, when tricks are used then the
[339.80] relationship gets weakened, this is right, good  Let's
[344.36] leave this aside, tell me what to name Chote Miya, have
[348.40] you thought of anything? Tell me
[352.12] brother, Grandma has come, ask her,
[356.00] brother what should I name Hasan's son, whatever
[358.64] you people want, keep it.
[362.60] Asan, you just call the marriage hall people and
[366.16] refuse them, I had already done that
[370.04] to all the guests who had been distributed the wedding cards, you
[373.20] also call them and refuse them,
[375.32] why are you getting angry at me, the
[378.96] wedding is not cancelled because of me, but now you are feeling happy
[381.68] as if some of your heartfelt wishes have been
[384.68] fulfilled,
[387.96] my wish of having a daughter-in-law and grandson to come has been
[391.72] fulfilled,
[394.16] I am happy about that,
[396.92] yes, all your wishes are being fulfilled,
[404.76] my only luck is bad,
[409.44] I am leaving this house, yes, go son, go,
[414.44] till the time your mother will vent her anger on me again,
[416.32] she will not get any peace,
[418.76] you go [
[419.63] Sangeet] It's
[433.44] not even been a day since Urup left but it
[437.56] seems as
[438.80] if the shine of our house has gone, Hama is right, she
[445.12] was with me for so long that
[449.64] without her, it feels like a home  Virar, she made space for
[452.36] herself and went away Son, you used to go to work,
[456.04] then she used to roam around me the whole day
[459.24] Amma, I want this, Amma, I want that, a very
[464.16] sweet, innocent girl, may Allah bless our fate,
[467.24] Amen Amma, what do you think,
[471.32] she will come to meet us, why won't she come? She has
[475.68] called me mother, I am her mother, she will
[480.24] definitely come,
[484.20] see from me Amma, don't have much expectation, she was a
[488.96] daughter of many rich people, she has
[491.60] gone away to her world, she will
[494.56] not come back now Amma, she had become Babli, so
[498.72] beware, whoever calls my daughter Babli, she was
[501.44] innocent yesterday as well as she is innocent today
[505.53] [Music]
[506.92] ok Nana
[510.63] [Music] does
[512.16] n't say anything to your daughter, my daughter is
[514.92] very intelligent and courageous, you will see,
[518.48] one day or the other, she will surprise everyone, those who
[523.72] call my daughter crazy, just
[527.32] see, one day or the other, they will all become crazy themselves,
[535.56] yes, ok Amma, if you are full of praising your daughter, then order something to
[538.88] eat, I am feeling hungry,
[542.40] yes, yes, I am doing it
[544.93] [Music]
[558.07] [Music]
[563.16] I am going to sleep, go to sleep, I am going to sleep,
[581.52] oh
[582.80] son, at this time in the night, go out of the room, is everything
[586.00] alright, right? Just Labhi  Ase was sleeping
[590.36] in the room, this gentleman started crying, I took him
[594.04] out,
[595.64] ok I was just asking, so was Aunty
[601.90] [Sangeet]
[605.00] ji, are you sure that
[609.28] Asein was marrying Fara?
[612.40] Yes
[614.92] son, why did I start talking nonsense, all the
[619.08] arrangements were gone, even the cards were printed,
[623.12] why do you have any doubts, I was just
[631.56] asking
[634.76] you, is
[639.72] this right, what is the matter, if Asein was marrying Fara, then
[644.84] how is it possible that
[649.84] Asein is talking to both Fara and Mahi at the same time,
[653.80] how can Aunty
[658.24] tolerate
[660.00] and how can Fara agree to his marriage to Mahi,
[663.16] what is going on
[674.73] [Sangeet]
[680.18] [Sangeet]
[684.84] come on son, brother, where is our little Miya,
[689.88] he is upstairs, playing with Labhi, ok ok ok
[693.88] son, do one thing, go to the market today,
[697.44] so that you can shop for some clothes for him,
[700.64] Nayla, you come along with him, it is
[705.08] possible that he might not know
[706.96] from where to get good clothes for children,
[708.96] yes,
[711.20] definitely
[713.44] Asein son, I am thinking that you should take leave from the office today,
[715.96] stay with him today, it's good
[720.48] [Sangeet]
[731.24] Rub  She has died at the house of one of my acquaintances,
[735.20] so I was going to pay my respects, I will be back
[737.56] in a little while, okay, you
[741.80] go and tell your acquaintances to have some
[745.32] patience
[749.52] because no one can stop the one who comes nor
[759.96] listen to the one who leaves, I was thinking that I should
[763.76] shift to Khala B's room for a few days, why would
[768.60] you shift to Labhi's quarter, she
[772.36] just cries at night, your sleep gets
[775.48] disturbed, so no, no, there is no such
[778.16] thing,
[779.92] my wife should stay in the servant quarter and I should stay
[783.08] in this room, this cannot happen, I don't remember,
[786.76] but maybe earlier also she was staying in Khala B's room
[789.52] and you are
[793.48] not alone here, you probably don't remember, you were here,
[796.68] in this very room, okay, when I
[801.36] came back, all my stuff was lying in Khala B's
[803.48] quarter, so I thought maybe it was
[806.32] actually my uncle, yes, Khala B
[810.12] told me, sorry, I forgot, she had taken my
[813.00] stuff away from here, yes, Khala B must have taken it away,
[820.64] but I didn't understand,
[824.16] if I was staying in this room, then why did I
[828.20] take all my stuff away  And why did she go there
[831.76] [Sangeet]
[833.20] And more importantly how did you let them
[838.56] take my stuff?
[841.12] Yeah, right?
[844.84] I shouldn't have let them do this.
[848.24] I should have stopped them. I don't know.
[851.84] Maybe I didn't notice this.
[856.96] Your attention must have been diverted to other matters.
[859.96] It's
[863.12] okay. Well, you go. They must be waiting for you.
[873.72] Listen, I can't find one more
[877.40] thing.
[883.12] I asked my aunt too. She said,
[886.04] maybe you gave it to your mother.
[892.40] Please take it back from her. Don't
[904.96] worry, I will get it back. So please
[908.24] take it back from her.
[909.72] Khuda Hafiz Allah Hafiz
[918.46] [Sangeet]
[929.26] [Sangeet]
[930.52] Mero
[931.90] [Sangeet]
[933.40] Bachcha, bas bas bas bas, tell Labhi Arup that we have to go to the
[939.84] mall. The daughter has gone,
[945.32] but where has she gone to the market? She was saying that she has to go shopping for the little one.
[950.32] Shopping for the little one. But she had to go with me. She was
[953.36] saying that aunty will take time to get ready. That's why
[955.52] I am going alone. She has
[958.32] gone with Asan.
[959.72] No, no, with the driver. Madam
[962.28] could not wait for me for a while.
[965.08] Well, I don't have any interest in going with him either.
[971.52] Why are you crying?  Does he want to
[974.60] drink milk or not? He has just drunk milk.
[978.88] Aunty also must have drunk milk. His diaper must have become wet. You should
[981.76] change it. The diapers were finished. Aru has gone to get it. She must be
[984.56] coming to get it.
[985.92] Till then will the child keep crying? Aunty should also take
[989.52] off his diaper and control him. But
[992.24] till then what should I feed him? Aunty should also
[995.88] wrap him in a sheet. He's a small child. What
[999.40] happened? [
[1019.27] Music] Baba, just now, just now. Uncle would have come. Uncle would have come. I'm laughing. [Music]
[1036.72] Salam Walekum Walekum Assalam. Come on,
[1058.16] what's the time? It must be
[1060.16] almost 5 o'clock right now.
[1064.52] Why are you laughing?
[1067.40] Today at exactly 5 o'clock, your and my Nikah was
[1073.08] but see, how strange it is. Are
[1077.12] you also here? I'm also here.
[1080.72] But neither is there a Qazi nor a
[1083.32] witness. Just thinking this, I started laughing at my fate.
[1088.16] [Music]
[1089.64] Look mother, it's not my fault.
[1094.60] How would I know that she would come back?
[1098.64] When did I say that it was your fault? Can I
[1106.84] ask you one thing?
[1110.40] Yes, ask. Your and my Nikah had to be kept
[1114.28] secret anyway. So, what difference does it make if Arup comes or
[1117.80] not?
[1121.16] What do you mean?  What are you saying? It means
[1124.56] that even earlier you were going to
[1127.12] hide your marriage with me from your would be
[1129.76] wife Fara,
[1132.60] then why can't you hide it from Roop?
[1136.60] How can this happen? Why can't this happen?
[1140.52] Anyway I am a spare wheel of your life's car
[1143.16] which just stays in the trunk of the car.
[1147.04] Now Arup has returned.
[1152.24] I was not taking Arup's place even earlier. You
[1155.28] were giving that place to Fara, so what difference does it make?
[1160.60] I would have been your secret wife even earlier
[1163.48] and even now.
[1165.32] Look, my
[1167.72] please don't talk like this to me at this time.
[1170.16] I am already very confused. Do
[1174.24] n't increase my confusion by saying such things.
[1179.24] Actually,
[1183.04] I had come here to take back the jewellery
[1187.44] that I had given you. Because Arup is repeatedly
[1190.96] asking about them.
[1192.32] Please, those
[1202.08] jewellery are not with me. Amma
[1205.49] [Music]
[1212.36] Amma
[1219.24] Amma Alam waekum waekum
[1223.04] assalam. When did you come son? I have just come to
[1228.76] take back the jewellery that you had given me. Where is the spare wheel
[1234.68] with me? What do you mean, son?  So I
[1240.72] sold it and kept the money, if you ask I will bring it and give it to you I sold it, I mean the
[1246.52] money
[1255.58] [Music]
[1257.60] Okay I'm leaving, okay son, keep coming
[1261.36] now at least tell me how is Roop
[1264.61] [Music]
[1266.76] Okay
[1271.32] that Khuda
[1273.60] Hafiz Allah
[1279.12] Hafiz Amma, when did you sell the jewellery, where did you keep the jewellery,
[1284.20] then why did you lie to S and
[1288.08] if he had asked for the money, then you would have said
[1291.72] what happened by keeping it in the bank,
[1294.44] you got the money but
[1298.80] what did I get, there's no need to speak too many filmy dialogues, I wo
[1304.12] n't take all this money with me to the grave, it will be
[1305.88] useful for you only, let me talk to you
[1309.19] [Music]
[1315.96] Listen, did I tell you about the marriage with Esan
[1325.43] [Music]
[1328.64] no, aunt
[1331.68] also, was Esan having an affair with Mahi as well, no, no, there's
[1336.52] nothing like that,
[1344.08] but why did you think of this,
[1351.84] aunt also didn't think about it, it's the
[1353.76] reality,
[1359.00] your Munna Miya was going to marry Mai as well along with Fara, right
[1366.36] daughter, how can this be true,
[1371.08] but this is the truth, I'm
[1375.96] just waiting for this thing, when would you tell me this truth
[1385.61] [Music]
[1390.88] look, Fara Jo  Whatever happened was
[1394.36] not my fault
[1396.84] but I still wanted to
[1401.20] come myself and explain everything to you and
[1402.64] apologize to you. If it was not your fault then why are
[1405.68] you saying sorry? Do
[1408.92] you know how much
[1412.72] insulted Mom and I were among our acquaintances? I cannot tell you that that
[1415.24] too was only
[1418.16] because of Khala's stubbornness. But
[1420.04] Mama did not know that A would come back immediately.
[1423.56] Well, what's done is done. You
[1428.08] told Roop that we were going to get married.
[1430.48] No, so you could not tell me right now. Are
[1435.28] you afraid that B will leave you?
[1438.96] Yes, that is the fear, isn't it? It is possible that she will not do that.
[1443.56] And if she leaves, then well, even if that happens, don't
[1446.52] keep any expectations from me and Mom. Infact,
[1450.12] I am planning to shift to London.
[1454.48] Okay, but in future it will never happen that
[1459.56] because of me you get into any difficult situation
[1463.52] and get stuck in that situation. Really thank you very much and
[1469.24] I am really very sorry.
[1472.35] [Sangeet]
[1501.68] Choti Miya is getting herself worked up. I
[1504.08] thought I should take her for a massage to freshen up a bit.  She
[1507.24] flushes it, yes I do,
[1509.84] but when he starts crying,
[1511.68] Aroob refuses,
[1513.48] why would she refuse, massage is
[1516.88] good for children, bring it
[1519.72] here, give it to me, aunt
[1523.68] also bring the baby inside, it's time for his feet, he's coming

[1649.48] seen, you don't even let me touch my grandson, come,  The
[1652.72] child must have been
[1656.72] hungry that's why she took him away. This is
[1659.44] not the first time when I try to pick up the child,
[1662.16] he remembers his milk. I
[1665.68] am his grandmother and I too feel like
[1672.60] hugging his child to my chest. I am not a child. I understand everything.
[1676.20] What is she doing? What is she doing to me? Is she
[1678.68] taking revenge on me? What is she taking
[1685.88] revenge for? What has happened when she does
[1690.44] n't even remember how your and her relationship was? Then
[1696.28] tell me what is the revenge for? Tell me, I am wrong in everything. Okay I am

[1782.20] else, or
[1786.16] what? Or
[1788.36] find a new look
[1792.99] [Music] What kind of a
[1794.48] man are you saying?
[1798.48] I myself am telling you to
[1800.84] find someone else and you are getting angry at that too.
[1804.20] Please don't joke like this, friend.
[1807.88] Joke. When I was not here, didn't you
[1811.52] look for someone else in my place? And
[1821.52] actually, I want to tell you something.
[1825.80] I would also like to hear from you,
[1830.68] actually
[1832.16] when you were not here, I mean when you were
[1835.96] missing,
[1843.64] then why are you getting so nervous,
[1847.20] what happened when I was not here,
[1850.16] actually my
[1852.56] uncle was very big, how would I spend my life alone,
[1864.56] so he said that
[1867.28] I should get married again,
[1871.56] aunty suggested you to get
[1874.56] married again
[1878.15] [Music]
[1879.80] so what did you
