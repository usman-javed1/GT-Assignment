She will stay here, where else will she go? Auntie, what are you saying? If another girl comes to this house, her behavior will be worse than Mama's. I am here to take care of her. and... and what? And what, son?  Stepmother's are not good with children? Sharukh, you are very bad. You told me you would bring me lots of sweets and chocolates at the wedding time  and you promised.

I promise, no matter how much you change, no matter what you become, I will always love you. music I'm sorry, did you want something? No, I just got what I wanted.

What I mean is, what will he do now? Mom, you know him, he's been emotionally sensitive since he was a kid. How can he close his eyes to reality? He says he'll make himself a six-year-old child for his wife. nonsense This is an emotional conversation. You'll see, life will soon drag him back to reality. Iím so sorry for him You feel sorry for him obviously He's my childhood friend. I want to do something for him. Look Farha, when a car gets stuck in the sand, someone pulls out another car or a truck  to get it out. car or sand?What are you trying to say When someone is stuck in a whirlwind of emotions, they're overwhelmed by their feelings. Someone else can help them break free from the grip of those emotions. yes and that  someone is you.. what happend mom? i just respect his emotions nothing else look i'am your mother You can lie to the whole world, but not to me. What lie am I telling? Okay, if you didn't have feelings for Ahsan Then why did you cry on his wedding night? that's not my fault i even don't know why i was crying But I definitely know that I don't have those feelings for Ahsan. look farah..I have let you make your own decisions since childhood. And even today, I don't want to impose my decision on you. Sometimes, a person becomes so engrossed in their external world that they lose sight of their inner emotions. music
