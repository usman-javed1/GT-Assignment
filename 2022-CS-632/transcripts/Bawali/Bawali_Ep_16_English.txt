You can ask whoever you want to, but the Khadim should get a job by tomorrow, who are you? Yes, who are you to give orders? [Music] Ding Marathi, you started marrying not once but twice. Now that you are sick, should I marry one too? [Music] I used to sit near Khadim till midnight and keep bothering him. The poor guy never said anything. And sometimes I used to sleep near Khadim. And you know, Khadim gives a very good massage. We have hired a boy who works on our farm. Khadim, clear all his accounts today. Pay off all the Tuesdays. He should not be seen in the office or on the farm from tomorrow. Now, if you want to marry me, then do it in a normal way. Bring your parents to my house. Talk to my mother and distribute my wedding cards. Everything should happen normally. Your father loved you a lot. Everyone has a fixed time to leave. Don't burden yourself with this. Am I such a bad person that  No one is ready to accept me Surely I must be at fault, otherwise all this wouldn't have happened to me But what is my fault? Maybe I thought of life as a moving train Sometimes I got into one bogie, sometimes into another bogie But life is not the name of a moving train Rather life is the name of a plate Where many trains come and go On my platform my companion was formless But I left her standing There I should go back to my companion, my form Be it a day like your beauty Or a night like your hair My love, my heart, I have been searching for you [Sangeet] What's the matter, you look worried No, nothing, let me give you an advice As if I were saying, stop thinking like a mother-in-law, think like a grandmother Trust me, all your problems will end Your worries will end, what do you keep telling me again and again Yes, I have not heaped any mountains of oppression on your innocent daughter-in-law, On the contrary, I am her victim, I am her victim Why are you getting angry with me, friend? I have just given you an advice [Sangeet] A warning to you  Walekum Khadim, why did you ever trap us poor people in your trap, but why you, what has happened, what was supposed to happen, this poor man lost his job, how can this happen, it is possible, Esan sahab is the owner, he fired him from the job, it is his wish, you wait, I will see, I will not let this happen, let it be, why do you trap yourself because of me without any reason, how can you not study, you have lost your job because of me, you are saying that I should not study, wait in the meantime Khadim, I will call you back in half an hour, okay [music] Assalam Walekum Walekum Alam Salam sit down, son uncle, do you know who gave me water when I had gone missing, no son, who were those people, a widow lady and her son, okay, son, we can pray for them, may Allah bless them, Allah will definitely do good to them, but we did not do any good to them, what do you mean, that boy's name is Khadim, he was an employee with you, Khadim, yes, but son, Khadim never mentioned the fact that you were with him, he did not even know  He came to know that I am your daughter-in-law when I invited him for dinner yesterday to thank him. Well, the man is really a very good and a very noble boy, but his goodness has been rewarded by his dismissal from the job by Esan. But how can Esan do this? Esan has done this, son. But why would he do this? Why would he do this? Maybe he is feeling guilty, guilty, guilty that he could not take care of me, that is, his own wife. And maybe he is also jealous that the caretaker took care of his wife. What nonsense are you talking about? You have asked N. What should I ask him when the caretaker himself has told me. Well done, you trust the words of a stranger and not your husband. The one whom you are calling a stranger, your daughter-in-law was with him for six months and the same stranger has also taken responsibility of your daughter-in-law in every way. How dare you talk to me in such manners? You don't know how to talk. Cool down, what has happened? How much courage do I have and how daring am I and how much  You probably do n't know that I can misbehave Naveed you are looking at this she does n't have the manners to talk to me, I am cooling down, son don't talk like this I will talk to her you can ask whoever you want to ask but by tomorrow the Khadim should get the job who are you yes who are you to give orders I will also see who hires that boy aunty don't shout too much your health will deteriorate uncle please re-hire the Khadim by tomorrow otherwise what will I do you tell me what will you do I will get the Khadim a job again somewhere but you must find a new daughter in law for yourself anyway aunty is very fond of getting Asan married for the second time nala la your health is la sit here sit here sit comfortably nala today you are fine let's go to the doctor I am fine you saw her for one thing she is threatening to leave the house nala nala don't take stress please she was angry she will get fine  It will happen you do n't know, you did n't look into her eyes, what I am seeing is there is fire in her eyes, there is fire of a boy in her eyes, when this fire flares up inside a woman, then this fire does not go away without taking revenge, I am telling you, she will take revenge, now you are getting too over it, Assalam Walekum Walekum Assalam Aasar ji, you fired Khadim from the job, Dad, who told you and Aroob has just left after informing me, but son, why did you fire him, Dad, actually he was not doing his work properly, that's why I told Kamran to fire him, you did the right thing, but what was Arup saying, and madam went away saying that if Khadim is not kept on the job, then she will leave the house, will she leave me, look son, she is threatening to leave you for a stranger, I told her that you people will not keep her on the job now, and if she goes, then she should go, what are you saying, mama how can I let Roop go from my life [Music] [Prashansa] Hello ha Kamran, I had told you on the call that the Khadim has to be fired from the job, and forget about that, yes, I am saying that let him come to work from tomorrow, call him and tell him, what have you done, yes, you are getting involved in the blackmailing of your wife, Mama, please leave this matter, please how can I leave it, you are giving too much importance to this ill-mannered girl, this crazy girl is dearer to you than my mother, please stop it, Mama, from the beginning, you do not want Arup to be in my life, you think that I am my mother, not your enemy, I don't know whether you are my enemy or not, but because of you, all the happiness in my life has ended, Esan, what nonsense are you talking, I am talking nonsense, yes, I am talking nonsense because I am nonsense, life has become nonsense [music] Esan [music] Esan, my fellow children, my fellow circumstances, are considering me their enemy, are considering their mother as an enemy, for the sake of a stranger girl, ok, ok, don't take stress, you are of Japanese blood, I will make you understand, Nayla Nayla, take care of yourself.

I don't have words to thank you, Sir. I did not support your daughter-in-law, but a helpless, destitute girl. Sir, it's fine, but she is my daughter-in-law. Why are you embarrassing me, Sir? Thank you. You have done a lot for us. Whatever Khadim Aisa did to you, to tell you the truth, I also regret it. No, Sir, why are you regretting it. We are clean people, what can we say? He is right. We are the sahab people and we also have young sons. What should we do? Sir, Qadim Hasan has reinstated you in the job, but it is important to say one more thing. Sir, tell me that from today onwards, you will not work at our cattle farm, but you will be a 50 percent partner. Sir, I am a partner. Yes, from today onwards, you will not get salary, but you will get 50 percent of whatever income we earn. But why, Sir? I mean, because if you were not there, my daughter-in-law would not have been able to return to Shad with health, dignity and respect. You have no idea how happy we are because of her coming. How much happiness we have got and whatever I am thankful to you.  I am doing this for that happiness, I am not asking for anything in return, that's fine sir, but that Esan sahab, it is my decision too and as far as Esan is concerned, I will talk to him myself, thank you, go ahead [Music] play, maybe I don't know how to maintain relationships, which relationship are you talking about, you have a relationship with your employee in your office, you have a relationship or connection with your neighbours and you also have a relationship with your dear relatives, I am sure that you maintain that relationship well, everything is fine there, but I am talking about other relationships, yes, of course, the relationships you are talking about are relationships of love, normal relationships are only maintained, one lives in relationships of love, that's why instead of maintaining relationships of love, learn to live in this relationship, the skill of living in a relationship is taught by the mind, the art of living is done by the heart, the mind is not everywhere, sometimes you should also work with the heart, it is good to keep the mind close to the heart, but sometimes leave it alone also [Music] oh what to think  Why are you smiling, have you made plans for a second marriage? After getting hurt and suffering so much, I have understood one thing. You can get someone through planning, but the heart cannot be attached to that person. And it is not possible to deal in love forcefully. You are my love. I am your wife. Who says that wife is not love [Music] S I love you [Music]
