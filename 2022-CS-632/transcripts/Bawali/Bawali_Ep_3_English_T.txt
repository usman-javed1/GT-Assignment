[64.66] You are right, if I loved her when she was 25, why can't I love her now that she is 6?
[71.58] You can't because you can adopt a child, but you can't make her your wife.

[252.24] My dad left me and my mom for another woman.
[257.74] My mom raised me as a single mother.
[260.18] And she always made me feel like emotions are nothing.
[265.42] A person should be practical.
[267.58] soo you are saying me
[269.94] that Aroob is mentally ill
[272.76] So just let all the feelings I have for her out.

[496.76] Sometimes in front of my employees, in front of my friends.
[500.32] she embarrasses me.
[502.24] Both of you listen carefully.

[840.42] as I'm talking about someone else's son, not yours.
[845.64] I believe in respecting people's personal choices.
[850.52] okay... what does it means?
[852.74] it means Ahsan married Aroob of his own will.
[858.88] Even after the accident, he still maintains his relationship.
[862.72] so as his wish
[865.56] If a child insists on foolish desires, it is our duty to stop him
[870.38] child...laughing
[874.08] Naila begam he is married man
[877.98] yes i am saying the same he is married man.
[883.30] As parents, we should explain to him
[886.52] At the moment, he is following his heart.
[889.02] And when the time compels, he will also listen to reason.
[892.90] "Human beings make the right decision only when they listen to both their heart and mind at the same time.
[898.72] Your philosophy has begun
[901.30] sorry.. i'am going to sleep
[903.82] Nail bagam can i say something?
[909.86] Sometimes, you should listen to your heart instead of your mind

[1116.94] And I have empathy for you too
[1120.36] empathy from me? What for?
[1124.26] Now look, Aroob has forgotten everything
[1130.64] So he has no feelings that could hurt him.
[1135.74] And there is no desire that troubles her either
[1139.62] but you..You have emotions and needs too
[1146.42] Which perhaps Aroob cannot fulfill completely now
[1149.54] But my feelings for Aroob are very dear to me.
[1156.10] And I won't let my emotions go unfulfilled for the sake of my needs.
[1160.02] i repect yor emotions

[1338.82] Tell that dirty uncle to take me to uncle's house.
[1343.20] And drop me off at school
[1346.34] No one sends me to school here.
[1349.04] And no one even buys me ice cream. Please give me some ice cream.

[1532.40] Ask mom why she raised her hand on her?
[1536.18] sit here
[1540.28] yes khala bii?
[1544.34] Sometimes children make mistakes, so adults raise their hands.
[1549.32] But young adults shouldn't be hit...khala bii
[1552.30] That's the issue, my son.
[1554.00] Aroob is young, but still behaves like a child.
[1562.04] khala bii I don't understand what to do.
Aroob is young, but still behaves like a child.
[1562.06] khala bii I don't understand what to do.
[1565.88] Time is like flowing water, don't try to stop it.
[1571.68] what mean
[1573.72] Leave the matter of nature and move on.
[1579.78] You mean you're saying I should forget about it?
[1582.70] no son
[1584.46] The weight of his love and his memory will always be on your shoulders.
[1591.20] And now get used to carrying this weight and moving forward.
[1596.62] Auntie, speak openly. What do you want to say?
[1598.92] What I mean is, you should get married again.
[1606.74] This way, the elder sister will also be okay, and all the matters will be settled.
[1614.60] And where will she go?
[1618.86] She will stay here, where else will she go?
[1621.46] Auntie, what are you saying?
[1624.24] If another girl comes to this house, her behavior will be worse than Mama's.
[1630.14] I am here to take care of her.
[1634.48] and... and what?
[1637.42] And what, son?  Stepmother's are not good with children?
[1641.44] Sharukh, you are very bad.
[1648.12] You told me you would bring me lots of sweets and chocolates at the wedding time 
[1657.20] and you promised. Why didn't you keep your promise?
[1661.72] Why did you forget, Sharukh? You never keep your promises.
[1671.86] You forgot everything.
[1673.86] music?
[1680.38] Even if I get old and my beauty fades, will you still love me this much?
[1689.20] I promise, no matter how much you change, no matter what you become, I will always love you.
[1704.74] music
[1738.42] I'm sorry, did you want something?
[1745.12] No, I just got what I wanted.
[1747.58] I'm going out for a bit, do you want anything?
[1750.92] Can I get you and Aroob some ice cream?
[1754.44] yes i will
[1756.94] Aroob, do you want ice cream?
[1758.94] I want coon ice cream
[1760.94] And what flavor do you want?
[1765.62] The ice cream will melt if you bring it.
[1769.58] So shall we go together?
[1771.58] We'll go for a drive and also have some ice cream.
[1776.14]  i have to do something important right now, let's do it another day.
[1780.98] sure
[1781.42] bye
[1791.96] bad uncle
[1809.54] what Ahsan is thinking?
[1812.52]  What I mean is, what will he do now?
[1815.86] Mom, you know him,
[1817.70] he's been emotionally sensitive since he was a kid.
[1820.46] How can he close his eyes to reality?
[1824.60] He says he'll make himself a six-year-old child for his wife.
[1829.84] nonsense
[1831.16] This is an emotional conversation.
[1835.36] You'll see, life will soon drag him back to reality.
[1841.32] Iím so sorry for him
[1843.32] You feel sorry for him
[1846.60] obviously He's my childhood friend.
[1850.52] I want to do something for him.
[1853.40] Look Farha, when a car gets stuck in the sand,
[1857.20] someone pulls out another car or a truck  to get it out.
[1862.42] car or sand?What are you trying to say
[1865.78] When someone is stuck in a whirlwind of emotions, they're overwhelmed by their feelings.
[1875.42] Someone else can help them break free from the grip of those emotions.
[1884.36] yes and that  someone is you..
[1889.50] what happend mom?
[1892.26] i just respect his emotions nothing else
[1895.96] look i'am your mother
[1899.24] You can lie to the whole world, but not to me.
[1905.70] What lie am I telling?
[1907.52] Okay, if you didn't have feelings for Ahsan
[1912.34] Then why did you cry on his wedding night?
[1915.78] that's not my fault i even don't know why i was crying
[1919.44] But I definitely know that I don't have those feelings for Ahsan.
[1924.58] look farah..I have let you make your own decisions since childhood.
[1931.00] And even today, I don't want to impose my decision on you.
[1937.40] Sometimes, a person becomes so engrossed in their external world that they lose sight of their inner emotions.
