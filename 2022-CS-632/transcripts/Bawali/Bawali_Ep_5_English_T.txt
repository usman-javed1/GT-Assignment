[706.35] Ahsan, Aroob isn't feeling well
She's vomiting and also has stomach pain
[713.11] And she ate street food
where is she?
[715.32] I'm just taking her to the doctor, leaving home now
[718.96] What happened? Is her condition worse?
[720.52] Yes, she's a bit unwell. I thought I should take her to the doctor and let you know.
[725.91] um..okay

[729.33] okay done..bye
[731.95] bye
[756.37] hello..
[758.06] yes son, I'm calling from the clinic
[760.64] Yes, please tell
[762.07] I was saying...
[763.80] what khala bi tell?
[765.40] Come here now
[768.85] why?..Is everything okay?
[771.45] Yes its all fine..but doctor is saying she wants to talk with you
[776.32] with me..
yes
[779.06] okay I'm coming
[781.28] okay come fast
[783.61] okay
[793.22] doctor, everything is okay?
[795.39] yes its all fine
its a good news
[799.51] But in your case, this is a somewhat complicated matter
[803.38] but Aroob is fine?
is she alright?
[807.60] Aroob is pregnant
she is going to become a mother
[818.49] but she..
how it is?..
[823.49] How many days after the wedding did the accident happen?
[829.45] Ahsan, How long did your married life remain normal?
[834.92] fifteen to twenty days
[837.14] it's definitely possible. ,Because Aroob is six weeks pregnant
[841.54] but doctor, she is mentally six years old girl
[844.32] look she is mentally six years old
But physically, she is a complete woman who can give birth.
[853.16] but doctor..
[855.10] The girl who cannot take care of herself. ,How will she take care of the baby in her womb?
[862.34] This is indeed a very big challenge.
[864.97] But now you and your family will have to take very good care of Aroob
[869.97] How will Aroob understand?
[872.84] This matter won't just last a day or two
[876.07] It's after 7 to 8 months.
[880.38] and doctor..\Such a mental condition
[885.86] may make abortion impossible?
[889.50] Look, there's not just one life growing in the womb, but a soul as well.
[893.65] And ending that is akin to killing.
[897.61] Now, under any condition, abortion is not possible.
[907.30] Oh God, what kind of test has he put this Aroob in?
[909.96] Look, this test is definitely for the Aroob
[913.66] But yours and your family's test is also very big.
[919.39] Who will explain mom?
[921.85] Look, whether someone understands or not.
[923.70] But You should understand this. The baby growing in Aroob's womb, its father is you
[942.87] Look, there's not just one life growing in the womb, but a soul as well.
[947.52] And ending that is akin to killing.
[953.65] Another soul has entered in Aroob
[958.41] and as long as this soul resides within...her recovery may not possible
[973.44] Son don't worry
[976.51] Surely, there will be some goodness in God's plan
[979.84] khala bii doctor also told you
[981.45] Yes, the doctor had informed me before your arrival.
[988.79] what we will do now?
[990.00] Everything that has happened so far, has been done by fate
[994.63] Whatever will happen next, we cannot control it.
[999.92] Alright, don't tell anyone at home.
I will tell myself
[1004.61] okay
[1013.71] As soon as Ahsan dropped this bomb in front of me.
My ground just slipped away.
[1019.40] What was Naveed brother's reaction?
[1020.95] What might his reaction be
They've gone crazy with joy about becoming a grandfather
[1026.00] He is very happy
[1027.38] but Naila you also become grandmother
so why you are not happy?
[1032.07] come on don't be stupid
[1034.87] Why wouldn't I be happy about Ahsan's child
[1038.29] but..
[1039.36] but?
what but?
[1041.43] but Ahsan was willing to normalize his life.
[1047.31] And now he'll be stuck in Aroob again.
[1050.34] he'll be stuck? What do you mean?
[1052.85] My son is saying this now.
that Aroob is going to be the mother of his child
[1057.70] And how can he marry someone else, leaving her behind?
[1061.37] hmm...then?
[1064.20] what then..
I came to you for advice on this matter. And you're asking me instead?
[1070.18] Okay
[1072.73] Tell me, who did Ahsan agree to marry?
[1075.80] obviously our Farah
[1079.06] Is this Ahsan's decision or yours?
[1081.84] it's my decision
[1086.86] Ahsan can't change this even no body can change
[1092.08] But Farha also needs to agree, right?
[1095.55] look.. Nazo you're Farah's mother
[1099.64] It's your job to convince her.
[1102.05] But Farha will never agree as long as Aroob is at your house
[1107.20] Nazo, Now we both need to sit down and think about this
[1111.70] then, what you've decided?
[1115.34] How do we get Aroob out of the house?
[1121.37] Your husband and son won't like it.
[1125.26] Leave them to me. i will manage them
[1128.93] Make sure it doesn't become a problem
[1146.07] What do you think about Ahsan?
please tell me
[1150.74] Why think about it?
[1153.34] He's going to be a father.
[1157.78] you cross the limit
[1160.32] Ahsan's life complications are increasing due to Aroob's pregnancy
Things aren't working out.
[1166.89] How's that happening?
[1167.84] some girls weren't willing to marry Ahsan due to his eccentricities
[1172.74] And if he became a father to a child...
[1177.30] How would any girl agree then? tell me
[1179.89] Which girl? Who are you talking about?
[1182.34] say clearly you are talking about your niece?
[1184.82] yes i'm talking about farah..
[1189.07] look one thing is clear
[1192.00] She's your niece and you love her the most.
[1195.20] But I don't love anyone more than Ahsan 's child in this world.
[1203.46] Look, Ahsan's future child is very dear to me too.
[1212.01] But the problem is. My first concern is Ahsan.
[1219.46] Okay, tell me what should we do then?
[1222.89] one thing is i don't know if this crazy
Why are you calling her crazy?
[1229.20] She is your daughter in law
[1231.46] Her name is Aroob
[1233.75] crazy crazy
[1235.11] okay okay Aroob relax
[1239.00] I'm not sure if she'll be able to handle a pregnancy for seven months.
[1245.86] secondly God forbid, if her child turns out to be crazy like her
[1257.52] I mean, If the child is mentally immature then?
[1264.50] Naila Hearing what you say makes me feel both amazed and sad.
[1269.20] okay you are her mother in law
but you are also the grandmother of her unborn child
[1276.39] I'm not just her mother-in-law or grandmother.. Ahsan 's mother also. Got it?
[1284.33] I will do whatever seems right for my son.
[1291.12] I want us to
[1293.79] send Aroob  away somewhere until the baby is born.
[1299.62] We will bring the baby back after delivery
[1308.15] what do you think?
[1310.84] and Aroob?
[1317.24] God...
[1321.01] greetings!
[1324.09] where are you going?
[1325.28] I am going to the market, will you come in an hour
[1328.10] okay where is Aroob?
[1330.21] she fell asleep while talking to Mahi.
[1333.80] okay..and Mama is in home?
[1336.93] she has also gone out, Â not at home.
[1339.66] okay you go..
[1340.84] okay i will
[1427.62] Khala bii
[1454.63] Khala bii Â left Aroob alone and went to the market
[1460.56] she's not alone, Mahi is with her
[1462.85] This girl also put in a lot of traps
She is not going
[1467.29] She is her sister
[1469.65] She comes here to meet her
[1472.64] Take her sister home.
[1474.69] Mama what you saying?
[1476.17] Aroob needs special attention right now.
[1481.22] Only the khala bii can give that attention and care.
This girl Mahi can't do it.
[1486.45] So the Khala bii is takes care of her.
[1488.61] right..khala bii will take care of Aroob
[1492.24] Your wife will take care of you, right?
[1498.48] mom..
[1500.63] I want to get married again.
[1505.27] But with a girl who doesn't treat Aroob like a servant.
[1510.60] What you and your dad are talking about..
I understand everything.
[1515.54] listen carefully
[1519.09] The one who comes to this house will be Aroob's servant.
[1524.15] And her relationship with Aroob will be like a servant's. Even if she's her own blood relative.
[1539.74] dear
[1543.17] Believe me,
[1546.06] I've seen the world.
I'm your mother
[1552.05] Please, give up your stubbornness.
[1555.79] please..
[1558.42] please...
[1562.59] okay mama..
[1566.63] okay i will do whatever you want
[1569.29] But...
[1571.97] you have to promise me something
[1574.19] anything
[1576.21] you won't tell Aroob leaving this house
[1580.48] Okay, let's do something.
[1582.59] Let's move Aroob downstairs with Khala bii
very safe.
[1589.52] It's not good for her to be climbing up and down the stairs in her condition.
understand please..
[1596.30] what?
In the servant's room?
[1599.78] We've never treated Khala bii like a servant.
[1605.66] The room you're calling the servant's room.
[1609.37] mom...
[1611.88] I can't understand
[1615.68] I need Â time to think about it.
[1619.51] look..Her mind is like that of a 6-year-old child. as you say.
[1625.90] Whether she lives with Khala bii downstairs or with you, it doesn't effect her
[1636.78] and be realistic
[1641.07] your life partner should stay in your room
[1659.82] what are you thinking?
[1664.62] mom
[1666.65] First you get a girl to be a part of my life
[1670.65] And then Â convince Aroob to move in another room
[1675.09] please...
[1677.72] i'm proud of you..
[1680.10] that's my boy
[1683.06] no worries okay?

[1729.07] So what if Mahi didn't come? I'm here.
We'll play with the doll
[1735.46] But you can't play this game.
[1738.18] I'm bored too. I don't want to play with doll
i want to play
[1744.69] this game it's enjoyable
[1746.36] Good kids don't throw tantrums. If you throw a tantrum, you might end up feeling unwell.
[1751.04] Then we'll have to call the doctor.

[1906.33] Look, there's not just one life growing in the womb, but a soul as well.
[1910.56] And ending that is akin to killing
[1914.65] and if we try to treat her while the presence of that soul in her
[1919.52] then she might die
