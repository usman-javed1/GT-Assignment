is she alright? Aroob is pregnant
she is going to become a mother but she..
how it is?.. How many days after the wedding did the accident happen? Ahsan, How long did your married life remain normal? fifteen to twenty days it's definitely possible. ,Because Aroob is six weeks pregnant but doctor, she is mentally six years old girl look she is mentally six years old
But physically, she is a complete woman who can give birth. but doctor.. The girl who cannot take care of herself. ,How will she take care of the baby in her womb? This is indeed a very big challenge. But now you and your family will have to take very good care of Aroob How will Aroob understand? This matter won't just last a day or two It's after 7 to 8 months. and doctor..\Such a mental condition may make abortion impossible? Look, there's not just one life growing in the womb, but a soul as well. And ending that is akin to killing. Now, under any condition, abortion is not possible. Oh God, what kind of test has he put this Aroob in? Look, this test is definitely for the Aroob But yours and your family's test is also very big. Who will explain mom? Look, whether someone understands or not. But You should understand this. The baby growing in Aroob's womb, its father is you Look, there's not just one life growing in the womb, but a soul as well. And ending that is akin to killing. Another soul has entered in Aroob and as long as this soul resides within...her recovery may not possible Son don't worry Surely, there will be some goodness in God's plan khala bii doctor also told you Yes, the doctor had informed me before your arrival. what we will do now? Everything that has happened so far, has been done by fate Whatever will happen next, we cannot control it. Alright, don't tell anyone at home.
I will tell myself okay As soon as Ahsan dropped this bomb in front of me.
My ground just slipped away. What was Naveed brother's reaction? What might his reaction be
They've gone crazy with joy about becoming a grandfather He is very happy but Naila you also become grandmother
so why you are not happy? come on don't be stupid Why wouldn't I be happy about Ahsan's child but.. but?
what but? but Ahsan was willing to normalize his life. And now he'll be stuck in Aroob again. he'll be stuck? What do you mean? My son is saying this now.
that Aroob is going to be the mother of his child And how can he marry someone else, leaving her behind? hmm...then? what then..
I came to you for advice on this matter. And you're asking me instead? Okay Tell me, who did Ahsan agree to marry? obviously our Farah Is this Ahsan's decision or yours? it's my decision Ahsan can't change this even no body can change But Farha also needs to agree, right? look.. Nazo you're Farah's mother It's your job to convince her. But Farha will never agree as long as Aroob is at your house Nazo, Now we both need to sit down and think about this then, what you've decided? How do we get Aroob out of the house? Your husband and son won't like it. Leave them to me. i will manage them Make sure it doesn't become a problem What do you think about Ahsan?
please tell me Why think about it? He's going to be a father. you cross the limit Ahsan's life complications are increasing due to Aroob's pregnancy
Things aren't working out. How's that happening? some girls weren't willing to marry Ahsan due to his eccentricities And if he became a father to a child... How would any girl agree then? tell me Which girl? Who are you talking about? say clearly you are talking about your niece? yes i'm talking about farah.. look one thing is clear She's your niece and you love her the most. But I don't love anyone more than Ahsan 's child in this world. Look, Ahsan's future child is very dear to me too. But the problem is. My first concern is Ahsan. Okay, tell me what should we do then? one thing is i don't know if this crazy
Why are you calling her crazy? She is your daughter in law Her name is Aroob crazy crazy okay okay Aroob relax I'm not sure if she'll be able to handle a pregnancy for seven months. secondly God forbid, if her child turns out to be crazy like her I mean, If the child is mentally immature then? Naila Hearing what you say makes me feel both amazed and sad. okay you are her mother in law
but you are also the grandmother of her unborn child I'm not just her mother-in-law or grandmother.. Ahsan 's mother also. Got it? I will do whatever seems right for my son. I want us to send Aroob  away somewhere until the baby is born. We will bring the baby back after delivery what do you think? and Aroob? God... greetings! where are you going? I am going to the market, will you come in an hour okay where is Aroob? she fell asleep while talking to Mahi. okay..and Mama is in home? she has also gone out,  not at home. okay you go.. okay i will Khala bii Khala bii  left Aroob alone and went to the market she's not alone, Mahi is with her This girl also put in a lot of traps
She is not going She is her sister She comes here to meet her Take her sister home. Mama what you saying? Aroob needs special attention right now. Only the khala bii can give that attention and care.
This girl Mahi can't do it. So the Khala bii is takes care of her. right..khala bii will take care of Aroob Your wife will take care of you, right? mom.. I want to get married again. But with a girl who doesn't treat Aroob like a servant. What you and your dad are talking about..
I understand everything. listen carefully The one who comes to this house will be Aroob's servant. And her relationship with Aroob will be like a servant's. Even if she's her own blood relative. dear Believe me, I've seen the world.
I'm your mother Please, give up your stubbornness. please.. please... okay mama.. okay i will do whatever you want But... you have to promise me something anything you won't tell Aroob leaving this house Okay, let's do something. Let's move Aroob downstairs with Khala bii
very safe. It's not good for her to be climbing up and down the stairs in her condition.

In the servant's room? We've never treated Khala bii like a servant. The room you're calling the servant's room. mom... I can't understand I need  time to think about it. look..Her mind is like that of a 6-year-old child. as you say. Whether she lives with Khala bii downstairs or with you, it doesn't effect her and be realistic your life partner should stay in your room what are you thinking? mom First you get a girl to be a part of my life And then  convince Aroob to move in another room please... i'm proud of you.. that's my boy no worries okay? relax khala bii look..what i'am doing what are you doing? what? playing You can't play this game. why?Let's see how much fun it is. no child no
