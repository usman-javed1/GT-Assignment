[620.16] Let's proceed with this matter.
[629.50] We'll assess it.
[632.84] think

[642.32] At that time, how old will you be?
[647.72] fifty years..

[676.76] Who is talking about abandoning her helpless?
[683.44] And regarding leaving her.
[684.48] So, can't we think about divorce either?
[690.48] How will another girl agree
[691.74]  live in that house while I'm still married?
[701.40] hmm
[703.40] Alright, let's do one thing.
[709.14] Let's figure out another solution to this issue.
[716.42] you could you get married to a girl
[720.28] could adjust with Aroob

[804.60] mom.. how do it know?
[806.40] Anyway, she wasn't ready at the time of Aroob.
[809.18] But she couldn't do anything in front of her son.
[812.20] Now, whatever needs to be done, it's all in your hands.
[816.22] mom..can i told you something?
[819.58] that Ahsan isn't interested in me.
[822.68] Why is that?
[823.82] He didn't take you out for ice cream
[825.78] so you're saying this.
[827.58] No, Mom, it's not about the ice cream.
[830.14] you know
[832.14] He was sitting in the lawn for hours with his cousin and so-called best friend
[837.76] look Mahi
[842.32] Just as you used to see Ahsan as a brother because of Aroob.
[846.54] It's possible that Ahsan may not be seeing you like that 
[850.88] Mom, now there's no solution to this issue.
[854.86] If you don't have an answer to this, does your aunt  have one?
[859.42] So, what do you want?
[861.70] Tell them clearly.
[863.60] Please show some interest in me.

[890.60] They will directly touch Ahsan's heart.
[892.60] understand what i mean?
[902.84] Okay, Mom, you're also very sharp.
[916.06] I wish my thought would come true.

[1098.36] why he is worried about her so much
[1101.86] i explained him
[1103.86] He'll need to find a girl like that.
[1106.26] Someone who doesn't treat Aroob like a rival but like a siste
[1113.58] Naveed, you always do amazing things.
[1116.20] okay.. but why?
[1118.50] you are not woman

[1130.94] No woman can share her love
[1135.36] with another women
[1137.36] Even if that other woman is her sister.
[1139.36] This is an inappropriate matter.
[1142.62] No two sisters can marry the same man.
[1148.26] Your hint isn't towards Mahi, is it?
[1155.80] understand please
[1157.80] she is not her blood sister
[1160.40] please stop it
[1162.40] Now, how can I make a girl like her my daughter-in-law?
[1167.62] Why are you getting angry?
[1171.30] Think about the matter calmly.
[1173.30] enough is enough
[1175.24] I have tolerated a lot of misbehavior from both father and son.
[1179.02] First son insisted and brought Aroob into my life.
[1184.32] And now father insists on bringing his sister
[1187.84] are you in your senses?
[1190.54] where did my wish?
[1193.04] Don't think of me as foolish.
[1194.68] Naveed..Don't think of me as foolish.
[1196.68] You and your son are cooking up this mess.
[1198.88] i'am not foolish
[1200.88] okay don't be angry darling
[1203.24] Nothing will happen without your consent.

[1354.48] and you
[1356.02] you've removed "brother" from Ahsan's name and just made it Ahsan.
[1363.74] no aunt actually
[1366.78] girl listen to me carefully
[1369.60]  one girl has trapped my son
[1372.88] And another one is setting a trap.
[1376.48] I won't let that happen.
[1380.62] What are you saying, aunt?
[1382.36] Okay, let's go, we're running late.

[1430.48] Why did Mom do that, man?
[1433.14] i'm sorry on behalf of Mom, please don't cry.
[1435.14] Just stop it, Mahi.
[1439.16] Uncle said sorry
[1441.52] I won't come to your house anymore.
[1444.30] okay
[1446.30] We will stay at Mamu's house.
[1452.66] Look, I'll go home and talk to Mom
[1454.86] she'll apologize too 
[1456.24] and i apologize too
[1457.12] please don't stop coming to our house
[1459.62] Aroob likes you coming home..and
[1462.88] and?
[1466.98] and i like too
[1468.98] music
[1475.74] how far ice cream'shop?
[1478.00] It's just around the corner.
[1485.58] music
[1492.34] Dad did you talked to Mom about Mahi?
[1495.04] yes
[1499.02] Yes, but she was so upset that it was hard to handle.
[1502.46] Come on, you're crossing the line.
[1504.42] why?
[1505.70]  Mom really embarrassed her
[1508.72] whom Mahi?
[1510.72] yes
[1512.72] and then i apologized her
[1518.32] You Tell me, what did you decide?
[1523.58] I really don’t know
[1525.58] I’m still confused
[1528.54] Look, your mom wants you to get married again
[1533.72] so she can be with Farha.
[1535.72] Otherwise, she said clearly that
[1539.38]  she will leave the house.
[1543.76] what are mama is saying?
[1545.76] Doesn't she know that if I marry Farha
[1549.00] she will never let Aroob stay in this house
[1551.00] I know, son
[1557.98] Tell me, what do you want?
[1562.36] I don't know, Dad.
[1564.36] Sometimes life becomes such a situation that a person's own desires 
[1569.72] and wishes become meaningless.
[1575.34] But I still wish that Aroob gets completely well.
[1581.56] I know, son.
[1583.56] But son, my question was about Mahi and Farha.
[1587.56] What do you suggest?
[1594.06] Look, son, your mom accepted Aroob out of necessity because she loved you.
[1603.66] But you want to accept Mahi because she is your beloved's younger sister.
[1609.08] Son, I don't think it's possible.
[1615.66] Man, Dad, you're amazing
[1617.66] First, you're arguing in favor of Mahi, and now you're arguing against her.
[1622.34] You're confused yourself.
[1624.34] yes buddy 
[1628.32] it really does seem like I'm confused
[1633.54] It seems like i've come under your mother's pressure.

[1641.70] okay don't worry
[1645.16] everything will be alright

[1666.20] he wants you to come daily
[1668.20] why are you laughing
[1672.42] You totally remind me of a mother from Pakistani dramas
[1676.04] "Who always
