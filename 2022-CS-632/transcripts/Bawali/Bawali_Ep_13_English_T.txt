[0.00] [Music] There is
[0.16] none of my stuff lying in my room.
[3.44] You know where everything went.
[7.04] I don't know where your
[10.16] stuff is. I don't know which mad idiot has
[14.12] scattered all my stuff.
[16.40] After I left, did everyone forget me,
[19.44] son?
[24.04] Forget everything that happened in the past.
[26.72] Just remember that you were the daughter-in-law of this house
[30.68] and will always remain so. Earlier, I was just your wife
[33.88] and love.
[36.12] And now also you are my wife and
[39.56] love. You know
[42.88] how much I love you.
[44.33] [Music]
[46.96] But I am not just your wife now. [
[53.29] Music]
[64.24] Mahi is getting
[67.24] married. So why should I not go inside because
[70.36] her
[72.44] marriage is with your husband? He is saying
[77.88] that he will wear the same suit from the previous marriage.
[80.20] Our son is absolutely stupid. Brother, when there is a new marriage, you should
[82.92] wear a new suit. Have some
[85.40] patience. You will see that whatever Fara has today,
[89.08] you will also get all that. Wealth,
[92.24] status, everything. You too must be doing something of your own will.
[95.96] You must be talking about it. After all, it is my
[100.24] life. I will do something of my own will too.
[102.84] Nature saw me, made me a child again
[105.36] and brought me to you
[109.04] You gave me the same love
[112.84] Perhaps my mother would have given me in my childhood
[116.84] I too had a wish I wish I had a daughter
[121.64] Sit down I am coming after freshening up
[124.20] Assalam Walekum

[400.00] I don't know where your stuff is. I don't know
[403.16] which crazy idiot has scattered
[407.16] all my stuff here and there.
[411.90] [Music] Aunty, no

[424.88] Ask him if he comes. If he comes,
[428.80] Sana, I will ask him who is the idiot
[432.64] who has removed my stuff here and there and no one
[434.68] even knows.
[437.38] [Music]
[441.48] No, Arup son, you were calling me in the
[446.12] lobby. None of my stuff is lying in my room.
[448.80] You know where it is.

[456.56] I will ask you.  I am asking
[459.24] you, come with me upstairs, I will tell you
[463.04] who moved your luggage and why.
[465.68] Come, come with me, did
[482.00] you see aunty's face? No, no one used to go to your room except Eson.
[485.36] You
[488.36] started cursing poor baaji in English.
[490.76] I did not tell aunty anything. I was
[493.28] telling her that the idiot who
[495.32] took the luggage from my room and aunty never came to my room, the
[502.28] lobby is calling me. I will listen to you for a minute and
[505.64] come back.

[529.36] Labhi, what did you tell Arup, that
[533.64] who took his luggage out of the room,
[536.72] which I should have told you. What do you mean,
[540.60] what did you say?
[541.76] I told him that
[545.36] your aunty brought your luggage, you even
[549.04] took my name. Oh, no, no, baaji, I
[552.84] told him that your luggage was
[555.00] not taken out of the room by your aunty, but by me.
[557.64] Oh, I was getting so worried, you are
[562.20] so nice. Thank you, thank you.
[566.60] [Sangeet]
[570.04] By the way, I am not scared of anyone. I was
[572.76] only saying this because you know that
[575.60] then the atmosphere of the house gets spoiled.  Isn't it Ji
[579.60] Ji, why would you be afraid of anyone?
[585.37] [Music]
[596.34] [Music]
[602.48] What happened, is everything fine? I have
[606.20] come running from the office. She has come back.
[610.16] Who has come back? That crazy girl. That Urup.
[615.80] Yes, and now she is no longer crazy. Has she
[620.88] recovered? Thank you Allah,
[624.56] where is she? I want to meet her.
[628.24] You got excited on hearing about her arrival.
[630.64] Now tell me what should I do? What should I do? I
[633.68] mean what do you have to do? Hello,
[637.88] Asan is getting married the day after tomorrow. All the
[642.04] cards have been distributed. And you are not understanding this. The marriage is going to happen.
[644.72] No, the marriage was going to happen. I
[648.96] mean you are understanding it absolutely right. Now the marriage is
[653.36] cancelled.
[657.44] What should I answer to the world? What should I answer to my sister?
[662.08] Whatever the matter is, tell me that our sister has returned alive and safe, then what is the
[665.00] answer to the second marriage?
[669.00] Naveed Naveed. How much insult will there be among the people. They
[673.40] will talk about it. You are
[675.92] not understanding this. Nayla Nayla Nala.
[678.80] Please, I understood all your words.
[682.28] But you should just understand that my daughter-in-law has come
[684.32] and I am going to meet her and you are bothering
[685.80] me, standing there, I will say, who is
[690.92] this mad man?

[767.41] [Music]
[773.60] Her phone is switched off. I will check.
[777.76] Uncle, did
[780.40] everyone forget me after I left?
[784.08] Son, forget everything that happened in the past and what did not happen.
[789.64] Just remember that you were the daughter-in-law of this house
[793.56] and will always
[795.28] remain so. I did not remember anything after the accident even though I didn't want to,
[800.32] uncle. But what about my family members?
[805.08] Why did they forget me,
[811.64] son? Some questions do not have a suitable answer
[814.96] and I also don't have the answer to your question.
[819.24] I told you to forget everything and
[825.68] move on. Please don't forget uncle.  Don't
[828.68] use the word ',' when I hear this word it
[831.12] feels like someone is cursing me

[998.72] Nayla, you had told me that her grandson has
[1001.52] also come with her. Naved sahab,
[1005.48] I was a little shocked when that madam suddenly came here.
[1013.76] I am understanding. When a mother-in-law's daughter-in-law,
[1016.68] whom she does not like, comes in front of her, okay, she must have been
[1020.16] shocked.
[1021.60] But when a grandmother's
[1024.28] grandson suddenly comes in front of her, how can she be shocked?
[1027.88] What should I do? What should I do at this time?
[1032.44] Tell me, of course, if I were in your place, I would have done the
[1035.96] same. You do whatever
[1037.32] your heart desires, I
[1040.32] cannot do all this. Okay, but please
[1044.32] do one thing,
[1046.68] confirm to all those who were cancelling the wedding
[1049.36] that the wedding has been cancelled. And
[1051.40] what reason will I tell them? The crazy daughter-in-law who had run away from our house has come
[1054.36] back, right? Nayla,
[1057.40] shut up.  You are crossing the limits and I will not
[1061.20] torment this
[1062.60] [Music]

[1207.68] where had you gone I had gone
[1212.28] I was right here
[1215.02] [Music]
[1217.52] maybe you had gone somewhere else I I had
[1224.48] not gone anywhere I was
[1229.80] standing at the same place from where we got separated
[1238.04] ok y know how am I
[1242.23] [Music] lno I know
[1244.76] how much you love me
[1248.84] apart from me you  I can't even think about anyone.
[1261.88] Well, tell me
[1264.12] where were you for so long? Do
[1269.24] you remember
[1272.00] what happened during that time? I don't
[1278.00] remember anything.
[1282.12] I only remember the last time I was with you, that is,
[1286.44] when the accident happened to you. That means you do
[1296.24] n't remember anything from that time.
[1301.17] [Sangeet] To
[1309.48] me, you seem a little changed. I have
[1313.72] changed. It is
[1316.60] also possible that you have changed. I have
[1324.12] n't changed at all. I am
[1326.68] exactly the same. Yes,
[1331.04] apparently you
[1340.48] are exactly the same. But I don't know why I am
[1344.16] not able to feel the fragrance of your words. The
[1349.00] fragrance that made me breathe
[1351.55] [Sangeet]
[1354.24] My fragrance is exactly the same. Even the
[1357.88] perfume hasn't changed. The
[1362.92] physical fragrance doesn't matter so much,
[1367.36] but the fragrance of love shouldn't end.
[1373.72] Why are you saying all this?
[1382.04] I told you, I feel that you have changed. You are
[1383.76] right.
[1386.28] Maybe I
[1390.40] am the one who has changed. Earlier, I was only your wife and love.
[1395.40] And even now, you are my wife
[1398.92] and love. You know
[1402.20] how much I love you
[1403.65] [Sangeet].
[1406.32] But now I am just yours.  I am not your wife
[1410.76] nor do I just love you
[1418.84] What are you saying
[1423.35] [Music]
[1425.88] Along with being your wife,
[1430.20] I am now also her mother and I love her very much
[1438.72] This is what I meant
[1440.64] [Music]
[1456.96] What happened to you Take it no,
[1463.72] it's not important
[1485.80] oh come on Rumi we are not living in the USA
[1489.00] that I should throw a bridal shower party, there would be
[1491.08] stress right, I am getting married day after tomorrow
[1493.88] oh Rumi I will talk to you later ok
[1497.80] bye
[1501.08] what's the matter mom are you fine, are you feeling well
[1508.24] what happened to you mom I'm everything is
[1511.80] right Roop has come back,
[1516.28] how did
[1518.80] she come back
[1520.32] yes and she brought her child along with her
[1524.08] well
[1528.64] I am not able to understand what will happen now why does
[1532.20] this happen only to me first my
[1535.32] husband ran away leaving me and now
[1537.64] before my daughter's marriage I keep
[1541.20] seeing all this how my marriage stops
[1545.68] what do you mean does aunt think of me as a pacifier
[1547.88] that when her munchkin cries then
[1550.08] she should be given a pacifier and when he stops crying then  Take
[1552.36] out the pacifier and throw it away.
[1555.08] What does poor Nayla have to do with it? It is
[1559.32] all your sister's fault. Esan and I were not having an
[1562.56] affair and getting married that I would
[1564.68] accuse him of infidelity. No
[1566.56] one knew that Aroob would come suddenly.
[1570.68] Now you tell me
[1573.48] what will I tell everyone in my friend circle
[1575.68] that my would be husband's first
[1577.64] wife has come back, hence the marriage is cancelled. Aunt has
[1580.56] made a joke of it and now I will
[1582.96] not tolerate it. Majeed, I will
[1585.64] go and talk to her right now. I
[1588.96] understand Fara, you have to get angry
[1592.00] but what will happen by doing all this.
[1595.12] Very good, you are playing such a big joke with me and living your
[1598.40] life peacefully, without
[1603.28] saying anything. What
[1605.64] happened? You are such a child daughter of mine. You
[1610.88] tell yourself what can anyone do in this whole matter. I am
[1626.44] very sorry about Amu's death.

[1641.80] was a very good person [Sangeet], how did he die?
