Tragedy and accident are small words for me  because they happen for a moment, but what happened to me has happened for my whole life. So what are your intentions now? I mean, what are you going to do? Look, both Aroo and I believe that a person should live in the moment they are living, breathing, they should be present. But Ahsan, the present moment is always between the past and the future. I mean, the Aroo you loved was a girl trapped in your past, but the Aroo today is a 6-year-old girl who is a stranger to you. you are right.
but the Aroo today is a 6-year-old girl who is a stranger to you. you are right.  if I loved her when she was 25, why can't I love her now that she is 6? you can't You can't because you can adopt a child, but you can't make her your wife. Music I don't know who cursed my child. Brother, who can control the affairs of nature? where is Aroob? Khala Bii is bringing her. Music Uncle? Aroob? Who are you? Aroob.. i'am.. i'am Mahi Mahi?

Now i understand fairy made both of us big. Send Mahi to Aroob's room so she can pack Aroob's belongings. pack her belongings, why? Will you not take her with you?
pack her belongings, why? Will you not take her with you? Why would we take her with us? Amazing, she's your daughter. If you don't take her, who will? She was our daughter; now she is your daughter-in-law. Aroob won't go anywhere. She will stay right here in my house with me. Naila Begum, what happened? Why would Aroob go? My point is, if they will take Aroob with them Maybe she'll grow attached to her own home after going there. Uncle, if you can come here every day. So Aroob will develop an attachment to this house. yes, We all may not come, but Ione of us will come every day to see Aroob." yes, i and your uncle  may not come every day, but Mahi will come daily to take care of her sister. don't worry Music

For the sake of God Raheela Begam. If Aroob were your biological daughter, would you  still say the same? listen..t's your habit to say this and teasing that  I'm not her mother, but her aunt. Did I say something wrong? hmm.. Mamma.. you made Dad upset.. leave him.. lsiten to me From now on, you have to go to Ahsan's house every day. Mamma, I have exams in a month.
