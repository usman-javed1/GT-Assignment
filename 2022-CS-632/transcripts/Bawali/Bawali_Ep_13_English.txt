[Music] There is none of my stuff lying in my room. You know where everything went. I don't know where your stuff is. I don't know which mad idiot has scattered all my stuff. After I left, did everyone forget me, son? Forget everything that happened in the past. Just remember that you were the daughter-in-law of this house and will always remain so. Earlier, I was just your wife and love. And now also you are my wife and love. You know how much I love you. [Music] But I am not just your wife now. [ Music] Mahi is getting married. So why should I not go inside because her marriage is with your husband? He is saying that he will wear the same suit from the previous marriage. Our son is absolutely stupid. Brother, when there is a new marriage, you should wear a new suit. Have some patience. You will see that whatever Fara has today, you will also get all that. Wealth, status, everything. You too must be doing something of your own will. You must be talking about it. After all, it is my life. I will do something of my own will too. Nature saw me, made me a child again and brought me to you You gave me the same love Perhaps my mother would have given me in my childhood I too had a wish I wish I had a daughter Sit down I am coming after freshening up Assalam Walekum Aunty Walekum Salam Where are you from Haroop It's a very long story I will narrate it later You tell me where is Asan And all this shopping has gone on These talks will keep on happening You come and sit here and see who has come Who has come Your grandson has come The heir of this house has come [Music] Grandson heir ji Aunty your grandson has come in this house There should be a function to celebrate this happiness [Music] Yes but where were you for so long Aroop I don't know Aunty I just remember the accident After that I was in the hospital and this sahabzaade in my lap I mean whatever happened in the intervening time it was not an accident nothing ok I'll leave Aunty Farani is here Yes she is a little busy I'm coming Hope she's fine She thought of marriage She saw something I mean she saw a boy, someone she liked ok ok [Music] Bye let's go Aunty I'm also here  I will go to my room and I don't have a phone so you will inform Esan that I have come home [Music] Hello, where are you? Please come home immediately. I am not well. Please come home quickly. Okay, bye. Where have you come from? Something or the other is going on at this time. [Music] [Music] Aunty, where is Laa? You are a girl. Laa, where is Laa? Have you seen my stuff? Why are you screaming? Aunty, I went to my room. None of my stuff is lying in my room. You know where everything has gone. I don't know where your stuff is. I don't know which crazy idiot has scattered all my stuff here and there. [Music] Aunty, no one had gone to my room in my absence. He must have kept it like this. Ask him if he comes. If he comes, Sana, I will ask him who is the idiot who has removed my stuff here and there and no one even knows. [Music] No, Arup son, you were calling me in the lobby. None of my stuff is lying in my room. You know where it is. What are you looking at? Talk to me, I will ask you.  I am asking you, come with me upstairs, I will tell you who moved your luggage and why. Come, come with me, did you see aunty's face? No, no one used to go to your room except Eson. You started cursing poor baaji in English. I did not tell aunty anything. I was telling her that the idiot who took the luggage from my room and aunty never came to my room, the lobby is calling me. I will listen to you for a minute and come back. [Sangeet] [Sangeet] Khala B Khala B ji ji ji ji baaji Labhi, what did you tell Arup, that who took his luggage out of the room, which I should have told you. What do you mean, what did you say? I told him that your aunty brought your luggage, you even took my name. Oh, no, no, baaji, I told him that your luggage was not taken out of the room by your aunty, but by me. Oh, I was getting so worried, you are so nice. Thank you, thank you. [Sangeet] By the way, I am not scared of anyone. I was only saying this because you know that then the atmosphere of the house gets spoiled.  Isn't it Ji Ji, why would you be afraid of anyone? [Music] [Music] What happened, is everything fine? I have come running from the office. She has come back. Who has come back? That crazy girl. That Urup. Yes, and now she is no longer crazy. Has she recovered? Thank you Allah, where is she? I want to meet her. You got excited on hearing about her arrival. Now tell me what should I do? What should I do? I mean what do you have to do? Hello, Asan is getting married the day after tomorrow. All the cards have been distributed. And you are not understanding this. The marriage is going to happen. No, the marriage was going to happen. I mean you are understanding it absolutely right. Now the marriage is cancelled. What should I answer to the world? What should I answer to my sister? Whatever the matter is, tell me that our sister has returned alive and safe, then what is the answer to the second marriage? Naveed Naveed. How much insult will there be among the people. They will talk about it. You are not understanding this. Nayla Nayla Nala. Please, I understood all your words. But you should just understand that my daughter-in-law has come and I am going to meet her and you are bothering me, standing there, I will say, who is this mad man? [Music] Who is he? Salam Walekum beta Walekum Assalam, how are you? This is the son of an elder brother? [Praise] [Music] You have given me the biggest happiness in the world. [Music] Today I am always asking, where are you? I do n't know uncle. I have asked aunty to call her and tell her that I have come home. Leave it, I will call aunty. [Music] Her phone is switched off. I will check. Uncle, did everyone forget me after I left? Son, forget everything that happened in the past and what did not happen. Just remember that you were the daughter-in-law of this house and will always remain so. I did not remember anything after the accident even though I didn't want to, uncle. But what about my family members? Why did they forget me, son? Some questions do not have a suitable answer and I also don't have the answer to your question. I told you to forget everything and move on. Please don't forget uncle.  Don't use the word ',' when I hear this word it feels like someone is cursing me son I have always blessed you and as long as I am alive I will always bless you Always be happy [Music] He is not even listening to me If the wedding gets cancelled then there will be a lot of infamy This Manoj also had to come now, he could not come after a few days What should I do The drama of heart attack cannot be done again I will call Esan, talk to him, maybe he will understand what I am saying [Music] Wait a minute Hello Hello Hello Hello Esan where are you Mama I am at a friend's house, you come home immediately Why are you well Esan I am saying you come back home immediately It's okay I will be here for a while Good What happened Everything is fine, Mama called friend there must be some problem in the wedding preparations Our Nikah is tomorrow right, so there will be no hassle in that Simply everything will be done We will eat Nikah, get our Nikah read and we will become each other's forever ok listen I  I have booked a room in a five star hotel, so after the exit we will spend the next day there. Okay, after tomorrow whatever you say will happen. It's good. Now I am leaving. Mama must be waiting. Khuda Khuda Hafiz [Music] Nayla, you had told me that her grandson has also come with her. Naved sahab, I was a little shocked when that madam suddenly came here. I am understanding. When a mother-in-law's daughter-in-law, whom she does not like, comes in front of her, okay, she must have been shocked. But when a grandmother's grandson suddenly comes in front of her, how can she be shocked? What should I do? What should I do at this time? Tell me, of course, if I were in your place, I would have done the same. You do whatever your heart desires, I cannot do all this. Okay, but please do one thing, confirm to all those who were cancelling the wedding that the wedding has been cancelled. And what reason will I tell them? The crazy daughter-in-law who had run away from our house has come back, right? Nayla, shut up.  You are crossing the limits and I will not torment this [Music] Anymore dad Mama what happened dad Why were you so angry what should I tell you your father knows nothing else except getting angry at me but what has happened your Arup has come back what when did she come where is she in the room upstairs so hello what should I do should I cancel the marriage now what should I do both father and son will drive me crazy [Music] I have been searching for you koi haath ho tere haath si tere jaat si koi haath ho koi haath ho tere haath si koi jaat ho koi haath ho koi haath ho koi raat ho meri jaan man meri khoob roo meri jaan man meri khoob roo I have been searching for you [Music] where had you gone I had gone I was right here [Music] maybe you had gone somewhere else I I had not gone anywhere I was standing at the same place from where we got separated ok y know how am I [Music] lno I know how much you love me apart from me you  I can't even think about anyone. Well, tell me where were you for so long? Do you remember what happened during that time? I don't remember anything. I only remember the last time I was with you, that is, when the accident happened to you. That means you do n't remember anything from that time. [Sangeet] To me, you seem a little changed. I have changed. It is also possible that you have changed. I have n't changed at all. I am exactly the same. Yes, apparently you are exactly the same. But I don't know why I am not able to feel the fragrance of your words. The fragrance that made me breathe [Sangeet] My fragrance is exactly the same. Even the perfume hasn't changed. The physical fragrance doesn't matter so much, but the fragrance of love shouldn't end. Why are you saying all this? I told you, I feel that you have changed. You are right. Maybe I am the one who has changed. Earlier, I was only your wife and love. And even now, you are my wife and love. You know how much I love you [Sangeet]. But now I am just yours.  I am not your wife nor do I just love you What are you saying [Music] Along with being your wife, I am now also her mother and I love her very much This is what I meant [Music] What happened to you Take it no, it's not important oh come on Rumi we are not living in the USA that I should throw a bridal shower party, there would be stress right, I am getting married day after tomorrow oh Rumi I will talk to you later ok bye what's the matter mom are you fine, are you feeling well what happened to you mom I'm everything is right Roop has come back, how did she come back yes and she brought her child along with her well I am not able to understand what will happen now why does this happen only to me first my husband ran away leaving me and now before my daughter's marriage I keep seeing all this how my marriage stops what do you mean does aunt think of me as a pacifier that when her munchkin cries then she should be given a pacifier and when he stops crying then  Take out the pacifier and throw it away. What does poor Nayla have to do with it? It is all your sister's fault. Esan and I were not having an affair and getting married that I would accuse him of infidelity. No one knew that Aroob would come suddenly. Now you tell me what will I tell everyone in my friend circle that my would be husband's first wife has come back, hence the marriage is cancelled. Aunt has made a joke of it and now I will not tolerate it. Majeed, I will go and talk to her right now. I understand Fara, you have to get angry but what will happen by doing all this. Very good, you are playing such a big joke with me and living your life peacefully, without saying anything. What happened? You are such a child daughter of mine. You tell yourself what can anyone do in this whole matter. I am very sorry about Amu's death. I could not even meet him for the last time. He was a very good person [Sangeet], how did he die? [Sangeet] He was ill, I mean he had a heart attack [Sangeet] You can tell him about Momani and Mahi from behind.  You must be taking care of me [Sangeet] no yes I was in touch with them it's a good thing I used to visit their house sometimes yes just sometimes I used to visit their house [Sangeet] after all it is my in-laws place it is your in-laws place also it was good you used to visit Mahi tell me how upset she must have been because of me [Sangeet] she came just this is an office call I will come no it is an office call so attend it na after how long we are meeting I don't want you to be away from me no actually I want to discuss something when will you take me to Amu's house tomorrow I mean you will go for two three four days okay I will come [ Sangeet] [Sangeet] hello Asan since when have I been calling you why were you cutting my call yes that actually I was with her at that time was she with whom Arup was she with Arup's Arup has come back yes she has come back and is absolutely fine she came today only so now what now but tomorrow is our marriage Mahi tomorrow's marriage and day after tomorrow's marriage now everything is over like this but I  I'm not able to understand anything right now, my mind is not working, ok I'll call you later, but please listen to me, bye [music] aa [music]
