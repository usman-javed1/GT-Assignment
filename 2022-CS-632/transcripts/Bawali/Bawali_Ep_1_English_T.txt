[1291.54] Okay. Good
[1293.78] Have you packed?
[1297.94] I haven't packed yet.
[1299.92] "There's very little time left, let's go.
[1304.20] Mom, Aroob seemed so happy, right?
[1310.76] Of course, why wouldn't she be happy? she got lucky."By the way Mahi..I was feeling jealous seeing her.
[1318.76] she found such a good in-law's family even without parents.
[1324.08] By the way.. Aroob is very lucky
[1328.36] I pray to God..that you also find such a good in-law's family, then I will breathe a sigh of relief.
[1334.88] OH, God, is that the only topic in girls' lives besides marriage?"
[1341.48] I know, there are very few. But a girl's real life changes after marriage.
[1348.20] Well, what about the girls whose marriages don't happen in wealthy families? Their fate doesn't change.
[1354.64] No, they just adjust to the new home. Look at me, marrying your dad didn't change much.
[1362.42] What do you mean, Mom? Are you not happy with Dad? Doesn't he take care of you?
[1368.14] Just taking care doesn't fulfill all the desires.
[1374.52] Music.
[1385.86] Madam, what are you looking at in the dark?
[1388.92] Since childhood, my wish has been to see everything clearly in the dark.
[1398.26] This is a wish that everyone has. Really?
[1401.02] "Yes, wanting to see clearly in the dark signifies that a person wants to know about their future, what is going to happen next.
[1412.84] One should always live in the present moment.
[1422.26] yes thats right..But the person who isn't present never truly lives; they always live in tomorrow or yesterday.
[1436.34] But I wish my situation could somehow be connected to yours in every way.
[1442.74] Madom! You're speaking quite poetically on this highway.
[1451.62] Live in the moment, for the next moment may be fleeting
[1458.66] Ambulance beep..
[1481.82] Music.
[1492.48] How are you feeling?Just a little pain in the shoulder and neck, otherwise I'm fine.
[1503.40] You're very lucky that your car didn't collide with another and you didn't get more injured. Your car's safety features were also helpful, and you were wearing your seatbelt.
[1514.98] Thanks to the seatbelt and airbags, you were saved a lot.
[1518.90] Doctor, my wife Arooba... where is she and how is she?
[1525.94] She didn't get too injured either. but she.. what she?
[1530.10] Actually, you were unconscious for an hour, but your wife regained consciousness shortly afterward.
[1537.70] Okay, so is she suffering from a mental illness?
[1544.00] Mentaly ill? what are you saying doctor? she is not coming under our control.
[1552.70] where is she?

[1656.62] Music
[1664.20] Aroob?
[1668.64] Music
[1680.60] "I understand this may not be easy for you to accept, but this is the reality.
[1687.96] But doctor, how can you say this with such certainty?
[1690.88] I agree that this disease isn't common, and many people haven't heard of it before.
[1697.22] I don't believe this is possible. What is the name of this disease?
[1702.44] Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as we call it, can be treated by doctors in Karachi, America, London, or anywhere else. Nowadays, everything is available on Google; you can search for it there as well."
[1719.96] Are you saying that my wife's age will be reduced to 5 or 6 years?
[1725.74] Their mental age is that of a 5 or 6-year-old child. Due to this condition, a person can become a victim of depression.
[1734.86] So now, will she not recognize me?
[1737.40] Not just you, anyone she meets after six years, she forgets everything.
[1744.84] "And what is the treatment for this?
[1747.74] ese mental conditions often result from accidents or shocks. It's hard to say when or how they occurred, or if they will never fully recover.
[1760.96] what's age of your wife?
[1765.10] twenty five.
[1767.58] So maybe after 20 years, they'll be in the same condition as before the incident.
[1773.82] Music.

[1907.66] You do one thing: prepare to take daughter-in-law to the UK. there will definitely be treatment.
[1918.30] Dad, I have a friend named Asim who is a psychiatrist in Chicago. I've also spoken to him.
[1927.86] what he is saying?
[1929.62] He's saying that this condition might not be treated in America or the UK..So that we cannot confirm that the patient will recover or not.
[1939.32] So then how will she get better?
[1941.24] He was saying that in this condition, a person's memories can get stuck in the past part of their life. However, they can sometimes come back.
