[0.14] dear look, I am your father
And I have decided that you will get married within the next 3 months
[7.40] that's it!
[11.42] ok dad
[13.28] I will do whatever you'll say
[15.81] thank you dear
[17.04] what is this, show me
[20.34] Look, Madhuri's friend is here. Now both of them will play together
[26.25] yes yes... 
[27.72] I promise you one thing
[34.18] I will marry Mahi, one day before my wedding with Farah 
[61.18] Mom, you are a widow and I am just an ordinary girl. 
[64.58] And we have no other support besides Ahsan right now
[68.04] If Ahsan is not here, then we'll end up on the streets. 
[71.31] And during this time, you'll also make decision regarding Aroob
[75.86] What kind of a decision? 
[76.81] Obviously you know Aroob and I can't live together in the same house
[81.24] do you like Mahi?
[84.77] yes
[86.10] its not a problem then
[88.04] See, a man is allowed to have four marriages
[91.63] Even if you also have three, there won't be any problem 
[101.41] Did your son marry an underage girl?
its a crime..
[105.13] How should we explain it to you? 
[107.44] Oh brother, we're not that foolish to not understand 
[110.38] who is she, dear?
[112.47] Mom, she didn't know her home address
[115.94] She was standing alone, so I thought I should bring her home 
[126.24] I am a very bad person
[130.87] I am a very careless person...
[136.73] because of my carelessness
[141.17] Aroob had an accident
[146.14] she lost her memory
[150.85] and now...
[153.77] now I have lost Aroob
[157.78] its such a big city, don't know in what condition my child must be
[163.60] where she must be?
[166.32] everyone is a vulture here
[168.89] And my child... my child doesn't have any sense
[179.31] aunty, please forgive me
[186.34] I've lost Aroob
[190.97] please forgive me
[197.27] No dear, don't cry
[201.08] stay strong
[203.64] may God keep my child in his protection
[215.07] Ok dear...
[217.09] It's time for me to offer prayers, so I am going
[254.29] dear
[255.93] what is your name?
[259.77] Aroob
[261.97] Aroob
[264.16] ok tell me, who else is there in your family?
[272.74] in my house?
[275.80] in my house...
[277.96] there is bad uncle, elder uncle & aunty
[284.49] and that witch aunty as well
[289.52] witch?
[291.29] aunty?
[292.41] yes...
okay what is your uncle's name?
[300.31] No, I don't know
[312.94] is there anything else to eat?
[316.97] the baby is more hungry
[321.46] what?
[323.22] Is there a baby in your womb?
[326.80] yes, its my baby. The fairy came from the sky & she kept a baby in my womb
[335.60] fairy?
[337.03] who is a fairy?
[340.52] Mom, "pari" is called "fairy" in English
[345.02] I see, but dear how can a fairy leave a baby in her womb?
[353.64] Oh Mom, they tell such things to kids in the city.
[357.84] Okay
[360.72] But where did she come from?
[364.66] mom, how would I know? I am worried myself, I don't understand what is this issue
[374.37] yes dear
[376.13] even we are strangers in this city, what if we get into some hot water
[386.31] so what else shall we do mom, tell me
[389.52] do one thing
[391.59] File a report with the police
[399.15] yes
[400.46] Okay fine, but its night time now
[404.27] I will go to the police station earliest in the morning to file a report
[407.19] absolutely correct
[424.39] don't you worry
[426.62] if God wills we'll find Aroob
[430.03] how can I not worry?
[432.96] its my mistake
[435.43] I wish I hadn't attended your call that day at the mall, then I wouldn't have missed catching a glimpse of Aroob and...
[443.27] you are making me feel guilty along with yourself
[446.93] I wish, I wouldn't have called you at my house after calling you
[451.05] My father wouldn't have seen us, and he wouldn't have died
[455.57] I wish I hadn't called you in the mall; then Aroob wouldn't have gotten lost
[461.25] I wish I didn't have any feelings for you in my heart
[466.07] Mahi
[468.68] I swear, I didn't mean to blame you
[472.24] I am really sorry
[480.34] God is great, he will help us for sure
[491.62] yes, tell me what's the problem?
[495.00] Sir, I found a girl standing alone on the road at night time
[501.02] so?
[502.75] So, sir I want to file her missing report
[506.87] so what's the matter of filing a report in this?
[511.81] Sir, she has forgotten her house address
[515.88] Okay, then say it like this: You found a small girl. What is her age?
[523.38] Sir, I think she must be of 24 to 25 years old
[528.53] Why are you joking? Can a 24 to 25-year-old girl forget her house address?
[533.39] Sir...
[535.31] you are right but..
[536.88] get up from here & leave, don't create a scene
[538.82] but Sir, what shall I do of that girl now?
[542.17] How would I know what to do with her? Go, send her to an orphanage
[545.89] As it is, they keep homeless people with them. Where will I keep her in the police station?
[551.37] get up, leave now
[553.84] yes better, sir
[563.44] any update about Aroob?
[567.49] not yet
[575.43] It's not that I am a stone-hearted person, and I am not upset about her going missing
[581.29] but..
[583.84] but what?
[588.93] But thank God that crazy girl didn't go missing from my house.
[594.38] otherwise, Naveed & Ahsan would have blamed me for everything
[598.66] That I have hidden her somewhere
[601.30] You think about quite weird things
[604.74] leave this topic & tell me, Aroob is not there in that house anymore
[609.61] Won't Farah have any problem with doing the wedding directly now?
[615.08] Just now she went missing, and Ahsan is so worried, and you are talking about the wedding in this situation?
[622.90] not right away
[625.32] A gap of 2 to 3 months is important; by then, Ahsan will also become a bit composed
[631.88] there is a possibility that Aroob comes back
[638.87] No, I don't think so
[642.26] I don't think we'll be able to find that crazy girl ever again.
[648.47] Just do one thing: pull Farah away from the stubbornness of engagement first, and then arrange the wedding ceremony
[655.88] So that I can bring Farah to my house quickly after making her the bride.
[660.11] Okay I will talk to Farah
[668.93] don't cry my child, please
[674.11] I want to go to my aunty
[677.14] yes yes, Khadim has gone to find her. He will be back anytime
[682.45] don't cry my child, please
[687.56] Okay, tell me. What is your husband's name?
[699.61] husband?
[701.71] Yes, husband. I mean the one you got married to.
[707.13] after all, that guy must have some name. Right?
[711.62] I am so small aunty, what are you saying? How can I get married?
[718.16] She is married
[720.30] if you didn't get married then what is this?
[725.14] what? What are you talking about?
[727.99] what is it?
[734.69] are you back? What did the police say?
[738.62] what will they say, mom?
[740.76] they told me off
[743.01] anyways, serve the lunch I am hungry
[746.38] Okay dear, I am serving
[756.90] I tried searching for her a lot, but I don't know where she has gone missing. I can't find her.
[762.78] When she went missing from within you, that's when she vanished from your sight
[768.31] try to find her in yourself
[770.50] do you see her anywhere?
[773.25] She was never gone from within me, as she is my love
[777.81] love or responsibility?
[780.95] responsibility!
[784.56] I think you don't have love for her inside you, but it's a sense of responsibility
[792.11] what are you saying?
[793.52] If you lose your love, then a person becomes very upset and sad
[799.21] And when a person doesn't fulfill his responsibility, then he feels a sense of regret
[806.96] You are not sad about Aroob's disappearance; in fact, you are remorseful and worried.
[813.25] See, I haven't come here to argue with you. I came here so that you might help me in finding Aroob.
[818.93] I am helping you
[821.04] By proving my emotions as false?
[822.98] if your emotions got hurt by any of my words then I apologize but...
[828.38] But I was trying to help you look within yourself and find yourself
[834.44] I haven't gone missing anywhere that I need to find myself
[836.61] Aroob went missing, so please help me find her
[841.57] Okay
[842.94] tell me, how can I help you?
[846.46] Find out through your knowledge where she is right now
[852.77] I don't have knowledge of the unseen
[855.66] Oh! it means that you cannot help me. Let me find her myself
[860.72] Let me request you once again, if love has gone missing from within you, then don't try to search for it outside.
[869.22] Because now Aroob is with that person who surely had love for her in their heart.
[876.37] and for sure, she must be happy there
[881.14] Are you sure wherever she may be, she must be happy?
[887.83] do you think I don't love Aroob anymore?
[897.94] please say something
[900.38] When a person suppresses their emotions to attain their love
[906.76] Then the situation guides him to his destination itself
[915.16] But the condition is that emotions must be pure
[921.96] Mr. Ahsan, you shall go & talk to yourself. Have a dialogue with yourself
[928.58] So that you can recognize yourself
[932.62] A person is strange; they can reach the depths of the seas but cannot reach the depths of their own heart.
[940.30] The heart searches through all the oceans
[944.23] Who can attain the hearts of the beloved?
[970.50] yes
[973.08] yes, send him
[987.47] Greetings sir!
[989.92] greetings!
[992.71] Mr. Raeed Dilawar Khan has recommended you
[997.06] and I am sure that you will handle the work
[1000.01] yes sir, absolutely
[1001.63] Mr. Dilawar is a renowned person in our village
[1004.39] sit
[1007.31] thank you, sir
[1012.31] what is your name?
[1014.06] sir, my name is Khadim
[1018.91] Khadim look, I have a cattle farm
[1022.00] it has 80 buffaloes, recently I have purchased 10 from Australia
[1029.12] I got to know that you've graduated from a government university
[1032.63] and I want an educated man for my cattle farm
[1039.82] I think you will handle it
[1042.59] its a manager's job
[1044.52] will you do it?
[1045.81] why not sir? Sure
[1048.73] Good!
[1050.15] Do one thing, Mr. Majid is sitting outside, meet him. He will tell you all the details.
[1055.79] Okay?
ok sir thank you!
[1065.26] dad, who was he?
[1067.94] I have hired a new guy for our cattle farm
[1072.74] anyways...
[1074.99] you tell me
[1077.84] There's nothing left for me to tell you, Dad.
[1082.33] dear, I can understand your feelings
[1086.52] but try t o understand my point
[1089.03] If you continue to stress and worry like this, I'm afraid you might get sick.
[1096.48] I don't know what to do
[1101.59] dear look...
[1103.53] I have never forced you for anything
[1107.29] Whatever you wanted, whatever your will was, I had always supported you
[1111.96] but do agree with my decision this time
[1118.16] yes tell me dad
[1120.58] get married
[1124.24] what?
[1126.21] dad, you know Aroob is missing & you are saying this to me
[1131.81] Dear, when Aroob was present here, even at that time you had agreed to the marriage. So what's the problem now?
[1136.75] But Dad, the situation was different at that time, and now...
don't be stupid
[1141.28] what's wrong with you?
[1145.81] dear look, I am your father
[1148.99] And I have decided that you will get married within the next 3 months, that's it!
[1157.03] ok dad
[1158.93] I will do whatever you'll say
[1161.46] thank you dear
[1163.44] thank you!
[1165.09] stay blessed
[1178.01] She was my Madhuri, and we used to go to the school
[1184.16] we used to play as well, see...
[1191.35] also our hair is very pretty
[1196.19] we get oiling done as well
[1198.40] so you're back, son?
[1200.34] what have you brought?
[1203.19] Mom, I have brought this for her so that she can play
[1211.39] oh my dear girl, be little careful. Stand & sit very very carefully
[1218.42] what is this, show me
[1221.68] Look, Madhuri's friend is here. Now both of them will play together
[1227.90] yes yes... may God bless my girl with good fate
[1231.20] Ok listen, I am saying it to you Aroob
[1235.66] get your female doll married to this male doll
[1239.96] but Madhuri is already married to Shahrukh, how can she marry him?
[1244.93] Really? So where is Shahrukh?
[1247.96] Shahrukh must be with aunty
[1252.43] its a sad news
[1255.45] So, do one thing. Make him Madhuri's friend
[1261.08] yes! good idea. He will be Madhuri's friend, new friend
[1266.15] But...
[1268.22] but, what is his name?
[1272.76] how would I know? you tell me
[1277.26] I shall tell? His name should be Salman
[1283.07] or Amir, or Anil Kapoor
[1286.10] hey, not any filmy name. Tell me some genuine name from here
[1291.16] oho, in what argument you've been into?
[1294.90] Khadim has brought him, so we'll keep his name as Khadim. What do you say?
[1300.10] mom, how come Khadim as my name is Khadim
[1304.75] No No, this is correct name. Since Khadim uncle has brought it, so his name will be Khadim
[1310.16] Khadim... Khadim, Khadim!
[1313.19] this is Madhuri's new friend "Khadim"
[1318.50] she is such a nice girl
[1321.68] may God bless her with good fate
[1327.74] her fate is good, mom
[1329.82] Now see, it's been a few days since she came, and I got a job today.
[1335.76] really!
[1337.28] you got a job?
[1338.96] yes mom
[1340.18] Thanks to God a million times
[1344.85] really, girls bring their good fate along with them
[1351.50] thanks my Lord
[1357.69] aunty...
[1361.06] give it to me
[1362.15] oh, thank you!
[1364.20] I have to do a lot of wedding preparations as of yet
[1368.55] Very few days are left, and I am alone. I don't understand how everything will be done.
[1374.07] Ma'am, the wedding cards have arrived. I have kept them upstairs.
[1378.29] you did very well. Is Ahsan at home?
[1381.54] yes
[1382.62] how is Ahsan's mood now? Any better?
[1385.81] he stays lost at all times
[1388.98] day before yesterday he came to my room, and was looking at Aroob's belongings
[1394.29] really? Was he saying something?
[1397.06] No, he stayed quiet even though I had asked him
[1400.40] It's okay, once he gets married, Farah will handle him herself after coming into this house
[1406.61] yes yes
[1417.47] aunty
[1419.68] please explain her
[1422.04] I had already told you guys about mine & Farah's relation
[1427.29] now make her understand, why is she crying?
[1431.71] Dear, I agree that you had told us. But even we had told you something in the beginning
[1438.77] what do you mean, what you had told me?
[1442.60] means, whenever you'll marry you will do two marriages
[1447.68] with Farah as well as with Mahi
[1453.78] but, now you are saying that you'll do he wedding after 3 weeks
[1458.90] its obvious, Mahi will cry
[1463.53] dear look, we have to face our neighbors. We are answerable to people
[1468.57] people?
[1470.50] which people?
[1474.75] look, you aren't a small kid who doesn't understand my point
[1479.16] you come to our house daily, your car is parked outside. So people ask us, that who is he
[1486.02] so we told them that you are our to-be son-in-law
[1489.69] but aunty, we had decided earlier that we won't tell people about my marriage with Mahi
[1495.68] yes yes, I am still firm on my words. I haven't announced it anywhere
[1501.08] but tell me yourself, the marriage won't happen secretly
[1505.30] The religious clerk will come; we also need a few people from our neighbors to witness.
[1510.59] now everything cannot stay hidden like this
[1517.96] honestly speaking, I had so many desires for my daughter's wedding
[1522.55] I had thought that I would organize my daughter's wedding with complete pageantry
[1526.61] But I have hidden all of my desires while considering your constraints
[1533.79] mom, you don't need to beg him to marry me
[1539.60] I will live without him
[1541.98] Mahi, please don't say this
[1544.73] why I shouldn't?
[1546.95] If Aroob can live alone due to her mental health, then why can't I?
[1552.36] No... Mahi
[1555.58] I will never leave you alone
[1567.81] Okay, fine... I
[1570.57] I promise you one thing
[1577.05] one day before my wedding with Farah
[1585.47] I will marry Mahi
[1601.35] dear, she is full term pregnant now
[1605.35] Will you take her to a lady doctor, or should I talk to the midwife who lives in our neighborhood?
[1613.85] Mom, I can take her but what will I say to the doctor?
[1617.87] who am I to her, whose baby is it. Etc...
[1620.91] true that
[1622.82] Okay then, let me talk to the midwife
[1625.95] and what will you say to the midwife?
[1628.86] that's fine
[1630.63] I will keep some money in her hand, so she won't ask many questions from me
[1638.21] Wow, O Lord, Your glory!
[1641.23] She who lacks sense is carrying a baby inside her
[1647.32] a girl who is a kid herself
[1650.38] she is giving birth to a baby
[1653.94] Wow God! your glory..
[1656.97] Glory be to God
[1674.11] oh God! it seems as if everything has become so expensive
[1678.93] what as such happened, mom?
[1681.16] One needs so many things for wedding preparations.
[1684.76] And the price of everything is skyrocketing
[1688.08] what is the need to do so much of expense? Call a few people at home & do it in a simple manner
[1692.86] What are you saying? You are my only daughter, and I will celebrate your wedding with complete pageantry
[1701.76] what happened, Farah?
[1704.16] you seem worried
[1705.88] don't know but I am feeling as if something is happening wrong
[1710.21] don't think this way my dear, everything will be fine
[1715.85] did you talk to Ahsan?
[1717.66] I talk to him daily but..
[1720.26] but what?
[1721.46] The closer our wedding date approaches, the more Ahsan seems to be distancing himself from me
[1727.69] is Aroob still on his mind?
[1730.41] I don't know whether its Aroob, or something else. Which is distancing Ahsan from me
[1737.35] Farah, maybe its all your delusion
[1740.26] I am a girl, whether we get to know anything or not
[1743.98] But when a man loses interest, we usually notice it right away
[1748.42] then why don't you clearly ask Ahsan, what is the problem?
[1753.19] its still not late
[1755.17] Yes, he is coming here shortly. Let me talk to him clearly now
[1760.24] Okay, anyways I am going inside
[1776.16] Ouch!
[1779.38] mom...
what happened?
[1781.50] this ill-mannered baby kicks me
[1786.13] mom, say him something he annoys me. Else I will also beat him
[1790.46] okay let me tell me. Don't you dare bad guy, why are you kicking my daughter?
[1795.66] now if you'll kick my daughter, then I will scold you
[1800.64] do you hear me?
[1802.13] Ouch!
[1804.13] Mom, he has kicked me once again
[1807.80] really? Fine...
[1810.43] lets not give him food for a day as a punishment, say what?
[1816.90] what?
[1819.44] but mom, then he'll feel hungry & he will cry
[1825.22] what will I do then?
[1827.30] let him cry, he is a bad child, Why does he kicks you?
[1831.68] He is not bad, but good
[1835.58] he is my baby
[1838.55] really?
[1840.13] Okay, let me bring food for you
[1843.68] Ok?
[1845.38] don't worry, first I will feed you the food then I will eat. Ok?
[1852.28] Wow my Lord wow!
[1854.88] what you have made a mother
[1859.30] even if she is crazy
[1861.42] still, she is worried about her baby
[1866.78] All praise to God
[1882.37] The girl who fell in love for the first time and trusted him is his father.
[1888.61] And the man of my life, my father, left me in my childhood after deceiving me.
[1896.64] we girls we cannot make decision that who & how our father will be
[1901.66] but we can choose our life partner as per our own will
[1906.27] and why do I feel
[1908.78] That a man whom I have chosen willingly will run away after breaking my trust.
[1915.09] Farah look...
[1917.62] a marriage is a social contract for me
[1921.68] but I ensure you that I will never break this social contract
[1925.87] What? Marriage is just a social contract for you!
