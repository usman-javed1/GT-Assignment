[0.00] The idea of winning over Ahsan was yours
[3.38] Whatever happens now, you will be responsible.
[7.14] So, I told Ami clearly that we'll just get engaged for now
[10.44] Will you refuse this marriage in 6 to 7 months
[14.42] or will my misunderstanding be cleared?
[16.42] Oh hello madam, who are you?
[26.00] What are you doing here?
[28.00] Aroob What are you doing in my car?
[31.38] Whatever you are
[33.38] music
[42.88] As a family, you'll need to keep this in mind.
[47.12] That their important valve is closed.
[49.12] Any type of shock or trauma can be life-threatening for her
[53.90] Your happiness is my happiness
[55.90] It will happen as you say.
[60.48] Now happy, even your wish has been fulfilled.
[64.68] Please, just don't take this to heart now
[68.46] You're doing amazing acting
[70.52] We just have to do what's best for the children.
[75.02] Is it necessary to name every relationship?
[78.50] An unnamed relationship.
[80.90] Whether it exists or not is meaningless
[84.08] You can tell them we'll get engaged for now and marry later.
[89.60] What will happen?
[90.74] This will happen if we adjust after becoming engaged
[96.10] Only then we can proceed to establish the relationship of marriage.
[99.72] May Allah bless Ahsan
[105.20] Otherwise, it becomes difficult for running house after your father
[110.60] What happened? Am I saying something wrong?
[117.10] You're not saying anything wrong, mom
[119.52] But do keep in mind that why he is doing this good.
[124.82] I understand everything; I'm not a child.
[128.42] And I also know that you're the reason for his kindness.
[134.92] Still, you have no objection to this?
[138.98] What's wrong with that?
[141.44] Ahsan is a good person and he likes you.
[145.66] He will marry you, He's not marrying me.
[148.82] He's marrying his cousin Farha...what?..yes
[152.94] Who told you all this?
[156.86] Ahsan himself told me.
[159.08] If he is marrying someone else
[162.04] what does that have to do with our family?
[164.04] Let me talk to him myself today.
[167.86] Did he say it as a joke?
[169.50] What else will you say to him?
[173.14] i will say him if he is marrying someone else so don't come here..
[178.90] Then have you thought about who will support us after that?
[184.44] Something will happen..Don't let your heart be small.
[189.28] I'm alive and well, no need to worry.
[192.64] Mom, your words won't even bring a loaf of bread
[196.94] But how can you maintain a relationship with him like this?
[200.28] The idea of winning over Ahsan was yours
[204.28] Whatever happens now, you will be responsible.
[207.60] Remember this.
[209.22] I was wishing for your well-being.
[211.10] How would I know he would do all this?
[213.74] What does he think?we are honorable and decent people.
[219.96] Mom, a decent girl doesn't cast doubt on her brother in law
[224.32] And no respectable mother encourages her daughter to do this
[230.16] okay now leave this matter
[232.40] Don't lecture me unnecessarily.
[233.64] instead,find a solution to this issue.
[236.38] Mom, you are a widow, and I am just an ordinary girl.
[239.64] And we have no other support besides Ahsan right now
[243.42] If Ahsan doesn't happen, we'll end up on the streets.
[247.78] So let things continue as they are
[251.20] Mahi listen to me..
[254.94] music
[269.38] Oh, oh, oh! What are you doing, dear?
[283.14] khala bi..what..slowly slowly

[310.04] Let's play tag.
[312.80] Let's run, you catch me.
[314.92] Oh no, dear, we don't play tag.
[318.22] khala bii why?
[320.22] dear, baby is sleeping in the womb
[322.94] If you run, it will disturb her sleep.
[326.86] then he will cry
[328.42] I don't want to be bothered. Someone take this baby away
[332.84] No, no, dear, don't say that
[336.92] why don't we say that?
[338.78] Tell him to come out and play with me.
[340.78] Yes, yes, why not? He'll play with you and talk too
[345.62] It's a matter of six months only
[348.02] When will six months be?
[351.10] They will be here soon; now tell me, will it be a boy or a girl?
[355.52] i don't know...fairy will know..right?
[360.48] okay what you want? boy or girl?
[364.82] i want girl..girls are good
[367.04] but i want boy
[369.52] no kahala bii i don't want boy
[372.52] If you want a boy, ask the fairy to grant your wish
[376.34] Alright, tell me, if it's a girl, what name will you give her?
[381.84] I don't know what will name heryou tell me.
[389.00] music
[401.84] These days kids don't understand anything
[406.04] why?..Now what has Ahsan done?
[409.66] Thankfully, Ahsan agreed to get married.
[413.34] Now it's this girl who just doesn't understand
[417.22] girl?..who?..farah?
[421.06] why what she is saying?
[423.44] Farah is saying that
[424.88] she will take 4 to 6 months to initiate the engagement.
[427.74] She wants to understand and is asking for some time that
[431.60] Are they both comfortable with the marriage?
[435.06] But in 6 months, how will they know each other well enough?
[441.16] I don't know, this girl has gone crazy.
[444.78] Then why don't you talk to Nazia so she can explain it to her?
[448.18] Poor thing, you know kids these days listen to their parents
[453.82] Naila Begum, things aren't like that anymore.
[459.18] "Did Ahsan listen to you?
[461.44] Never mind, I had a heart attack, otherwise your son was also saying noo
[467.90] Yes, for now, what should be done next?
[474.68] look Naveed
[477.80] I don't think this issue will be resolved until Aroob is here.
[483.50] Naila, where did Aroob come from all this conversation?
[487.40] Do you know what Farah's real issue is?
[489.40] That Aroob lives here, she will never come here as a bride.
[494.34] As long as she's here
[496.60] Why are you talking strangely? First you said she should shift to Auntie's room
[501.56] I've accepted your point.
[503.56] Now you're talking about kicking her out of the house?
[506.88] You're crossing the line, man.
[508.72] Naveed, please try to..no no never
[515.84] This can not happen..understand?
[519.62] Oh God, what should I do about these father and son?
[531.32] greetings.. son I have something to tell you.
[536.50] Yes, go ahead.
[538.58] Son, take your wife out for outings and excursions.
[541.86] I don't let her play.
[544.58] she get bored staying in the same place all the time.
[548.52] They also take little kids to play.
[552.98] Alright, I'll take her.
[558.28] khala bi?..i...Has Ahsan left?
[566.44] I need to talk to you about something...yes tell?
[570.86] We are arranging Ahsan's marriage with Farah.
[574.34] okay..And we've decided that Aroob should shift to your room with you.
[584.04] In the servants' quarters?
[586.20] khala bii? When did we ever consider you as a servant?
[590.50] Yes, but that's a servant's room.
[594.38] anyways..Shift her belongings there.
[597.42] as you wish
[598.92] It doesn't seem appropriate.
[602.32] daughter-in-law of the house is staying in the servants' room
[605.84] What should we do?if this crazy woman stays in Ahsan's room
[610.10] Will Farah live in the servants' room pretending to be a daughter-in-law?
[613.66] The house is so big, isn't there another room?
[616.42] Now, will you make the decisions regarding this house?
[618.42] Do as you have been told
[625.40] I have raised Ahsan
[628.84] I will also raise Aroob and her children.
[631.52] And I get paid for this work
[633.92] you are the owner of this house
[635.78] Put whoever you want to keep or remove.
[638.80] But I won't get involved in this work.
[644.00] khala bii?
[651.72] Its wings have been clipped.
[657.58] door knocking
[675.30] hi Ahsan What did you buy?
[680.26] no its nothing
[682.76] its groceries
[684.18] No, these groceries are not for me.
[686.64] They needed it, so I gave it to them.. Oh needed
[691.38] and what are you doing here?
[693.46] nothing special If you're free, can i get you some coffee?
[699.38] Yes, I'm not too busy right now...we can go
[704.12] okay let's go
[705.44] And yes Ahsan, I have talked to mom
[709.50] I've told her that I'm not ready for marriage yet.
[712.50] but why?
[715.10] Because you're not yet fully ready for marriage.
[719.32] When did I say that?
[722.28] you didn't say it aloud, but I feel this way.
[725.04] That's why I clearly told mom that we should just get engaged for now.
[729.92] Within 6 to 7 months, either you'll refuse this marriage or my misunderstanding will be cleared.
[734.88] That you're not ready for this relationship wholeheartedly
[739.48] And during this time, you'll also make decision regarding Aroob.
[745.48] What kind of decision?
[747.82] Obviously you know Aroob and I,can't live together in the same house
[752.10] Farah is she child..yes mentally child not physically
[759.26] you sit in the car i follow you..
[769.46] music
[779.72] this crazy has turned the room into a mess.
[782.94] No, it's become a madhouse
[785.40] When will I be rid of this nuisance?
[789.40] Now, what does she need all these things for?
[796.64] In her fate, playing with toys seems to be a lifelong affair.
[801.60] khala bii?..khala bii?.. yes Ma'am?
[809.70] Take all her belongings and shift them to your room.
[813.32] but Ma'am..I said that from now on, I don't want to see any of her belongings here.
[820.46] okay ma'am
[823.36] aunt?..come here..what is?
[830.00] come here and see.. yes tell?
[836.32] Do you know there's a little baby in this?

[881.08] okay sit here i neeed to talk with you
[885.10] sit
[893.06] yes? Look, dear, you're a sensible boy and Mahi is sensible too.
[899.92] But she's just a bit emotional, you understand, right?
[907.18] yes i understand...I was just saying, in any situation, one shouldn't be emotional.
[915.36] Especially when relationships are being formed or broken.
[922.16] yes you are right..Son, I have seen the world.
[928.38] And in a moment, I've seen the East become West and the West become East.
[934.58] Now see, Mahi's father isn't around anymore.
[940.06] So obviously, I have to talk to you about this.
[944.22] okay tell me..you like Mahi?
[950.86] yes
[959.08] so there's no issue..See, a man is allowed to have four marriages.
[965.92] Even if you also have three, there won't be any problem
[970.22] yes but...The issue is with Mama.
[976.22] without her permission..Son, I'm not a child to create a fuss about yours and Mahi's wedding.
[982.74] Look, where there is trust in relationships,
[986.38] there should also be boundaries maintained.
[990.40] don't worry about this
[993.64] yes but i need time to think about this
[998.20] Oh dear, why even think about that?
[1000.76] Look, this way our respect and dignity will also remain intact.
[1005.16] And you won't have any problem either.
[1013.36] music
[1028.52] come dear.. mama?
[1034.66] You moved Aroob's belongings from my room downstairs?
[1038.34] Yes, I had them moved, but why?
[1041.06] We had decided, right?
[1042.72] that Aroob wouldn't leave my room until another girl enters my life
[1048.28] Look, Ahsan, today or tomorrow, Aroob had to shift downstairs, right?
[1052.74] I just thought I'd move her downstairs today.
[1057.28] look you are sensible
[1058.96] It's better for Aroob to stay downstairs between these days
[1062.36] She has trouble going upstairs,
[1065.78] Besides, Aunt can't always stop her either, right?
[1069.88] its better for her to stay downstairs..but mama this is wrong
[1074.00] what's wrong in?
[1075.76] It doesn't matter whether she stays downstairs or upstairs
[1079.98] That's what I'm saying, why is it necessary for Aroob to shift downstairs?
[1083.10] its necessary
[1084.84] she's going to be your future wife.
[1087.12] She will never tolerate
[1089.70] That another girl sharing you're room
[1094.00] How are you forgetting
[1096.14] that Aroob is not just any girl she is my wife
[1100.66] And she is the mother of my future child.
[1103.28] I'm not forgetting anything, but you might be forgetting something.
[1107.00] Aroob is only your legal wife on paper
[1112.06] Your real wife is coming soon.
[1118.98] music
[1125.86] he is child. When will he understand? i can't believe

[1149.68] Aroob was insisting, so he took her out
[1154.26] Where did he take this crazy woman for?
[1157.52] i don't know

[1546.70] Dad, I saw her myself in the mall footage, leaving the mall
[1552.04] Then why didn't anyone stop her?
[1554.44] Why would a mall guard stop a girl?

[1581.62] Why? Don't we need to report to the police?
[1584.76] What's wrong with this?
[1586.28] Why do you want to create a scene throughout the city that our daughter-in-law has run away?
