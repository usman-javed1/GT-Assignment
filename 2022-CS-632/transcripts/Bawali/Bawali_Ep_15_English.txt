Will you ever be able to forgive me [Sangeet] Maybe I will forgive you If you tell me the complete truth I was thinking of naming him Bawla Arup God forbid why are you joking When he was growing in my womb everyone had named me Bawli too And sometimes I used to sleep near Khadim and you know Khadim gives a very good massage [Sangeet] They came to take back the jewellery they had given me I sold it and kept the money If you ask I will bring it and give it to you I sold it I mean what is the use of money Why does she refuse Massage is good for children Yes bring it here give it to me Aunty also bring the baby inside It is time for his feeding Nabat This is not the first time when I try to pick up the child he remembers his milk I am his grandmother I also feel like holding his child to my chest Mama was very big how would I spend my life alone He said that I should get married again You were marrying whom Fara [Sangeet] What do you mean by just Fara? I mean you loved me a lot Nasan, a lot. After I left like this, a huge space must have been created in your life, right? So you must have thought that Fara alone will not be able to fill such a big space and that is why it would be better if you have two wives and not one. Aru. What are you saying? Well, tell me, if you go somewhere, will the option of a second marriage be good for me too? I will never leave you and go anywhere. You had told me earlier also that I will never leave you and go anywhere. [Sangeet] That's all I wanted to tell you. There's nothing else. There's nothing else to tell you. Are you sorry? Yes, I am absolutely sure Arup. Arup. Will you ever be able to forgive me? [Sangeet] Maybe I will forgive you. If you tell me the complete truth, then the complete truth, half truth, gives more pain than complete forgiveness. Half truth, ok, you must have Mahi's number. Yes, what Mahi, I think, so let me check. How are you? Mahi? You guys have not heard of me.

No one told me, but Bawli will be called Bawli only, right? Syani will not say so [Music] Arup, do you have any complaint against me? Do you feel bad about something I said? Why do you complain against me? What did you do to me? I was asking anyway, maybe if you are referring to Esan's second marriage, then no, yes, it is possible that you have a complaint against me because I wanted to get Fara married to him for the second time. If my husband is going to marry for the second time, then my complaint will be with my husband, not with my mother-in-law. See, Arup, at that time, the situation was totally different, you were lost, we did not know where you were, your mental condition had also gone mad, Aru, the condition you were in, if any mother thinks of her daughter's second marriage, then what is wrong in it? A mother should only think about her son, the girl who is your daughter-in-law.  she is also someone's daughter we should n't think about her if it were your real daughter in my place you would have taken the same decision [Music] What Arup you are also like my daughter my mother died in my childhood you are my mother in law, just mother in law [Music] [Music] I am connecting you I am connecting you let me get this mother called hello hello I'm Amma Khadim's Amma yes Amma I have recognized you but tell me one thing you are just Khadim's mother not my mother oh no son I am your mother too that's why I asked Khadim to connect me to my daughter's phone so I can talk to her ok tell me are you happy are n't you happy I don't know I am trying to be happy what do you mean leave it Amma you tell me is everything okay when are you coming to meet me when you say so okay then tomorrow you can have lunch at my place okay son inshallah and Khadim will also come with you right yes yes Khadim will also come with me why won't he come dadam okay Allah Hafiz okay Allah [Music] Hafiz has called me tomorrow we have to go in the afternoon you can go  Amma how can I go alone son you have to come with me Amma please understand why don't you understand this is my sahab's house how will I go so what if sahab's daughter in law has hosted the party you are also very innocent will I be fired from my job how should I go oh brother why will he fire me you just have to come with me Amma you will not understand you will get me fired from my job I will just drop me there and come back ok as per your wish you can drop me there and come back okay then [music] Assalam waekum Khadim hello ji Salam waekum yes tell me ji ji the bus is reaching and you are coming with me no I will not be able to come inside Khadim what do you mean don't bother me at this time beware of me if you tried to run away from outside you should explain I cannot that Esan sahab then what will Esan eat you that doesn't matter but ifs and buts nothing you are coming okay okay just reach in 15 minutes ok come quickly Allah hafiz alam waekum Esan you can come home  Yes, everything is fine now. I had invited a few guests at home, so I thought you too would like to come. Okay best, you come for half an hour. Bye Allah Hafiz [Music] Son, ever since you left that house, the charm of that house has gone away. Amma, I miss you both a lot. I remember both of you every day. Khadim, you and I, what are you doing? Sir, Alam Waleek, Sir, Lek Salam Khadim, sit down. Asan, this is the person in whose house I have stayed for so many days. And this is his mother. Khadim, you never told me, but I, oh, how would Khadim know that I am your wife? When he came here, he told me that he works with you and this mother is Khadim's and mine too. Stay happy, son, always be safe. When I was alone and helpless in the whole world, they supported me. When even my own people had left me, then they adopted me. I am a diabetic. You people, especially Khadim, Khadim took great care of me. Really, Khadim took so much care of me. Amma used to go to sleep the whole time and I used to go to sleep for half the time.  I used to sit near the Khadim and keep bothering his head till midnight and the poor guy would never say anything and sometimes I would even sleep near the Khadim and you know, Khadim gives a very good massage, excuse me, he gives a very good head massage, he gives such a good massage that it feels like there is a professional Champi person and we enjoyed so much, sometimes we used to go to eat gol gappas, we also went to watch movies, we used to have a lot of fun, we used to go somewhere or the other everyday, we even went out to eat ice cream, once you sit, I have an important meeting with him, I will leave, ok bye honey, see you soon, what kind of things were you talking about in front of him, when did I ask you, yes, son, when did I leave you with the Khadim at midnight, what are you talking about [music] hello, command sahab, you are in the office, right? Let's do one thing, the boy who has been hired, who works at our farm, Khadim, clear all his accounts today, pay off all the Tuesdays that are there, from tomorrow he should not be seen in the office or on the farm, thank you [Music] Yes Mahi, how are you I am coming to meet you, why are you coming and I will tell you everything after coming [Music] Sir, I was lying to both of you, a lie, but why, look Amma, you and I know that nothing like this happened, if all this had happened in reality, I was at the place where I was mentally, the responsibility of all this would not have fallen on me, but Esan Esan cheated on me while being in his senses, yes, that's fine, but think how wrongly Kishan sahab must be thinking about me, let him think, what happens if he thinks, is the contract of infidelity taken up only by the man, ca n't a woman even do the drama of infidelity, oh son, where are you dragging us poor people in the matter of husband and wife, Amma ji, Amma son, relax, you two are the only ones for me in the whole world, you both should not worry about anything, [Music] what happened, why did you stop, why did you come here, please sit and talk, no, please friend, I am very upset, I know because  You would come here only when you were upset, so it means you are calling me a jerk. You are trying to say that I am selfish. It's not you who is selfish, I am also selfish. We both are selfish. You needed the support of love to fill the empty space in your life and I need a rich man who can support me. Why are you talking so much about it? Is there no relationship of love between us? Mr. Easan sahab, did you not remember this relationship when Aroob called our relationship as brother and sister? Why were you silent then? Where was your love then? You didn't say anything and now you are claiming to have a relationship of love with me. Mahi, what could I say? I was helpless at that time, friend. Please try to understand. Why? Why do you always ask me to understand? Why don't you understand that I am also a girl. I also have some desires. I want a companionship. I am not some prostitute with whom you made a relationship whenever you wanted and broke it whenever you wanted. Don't forget that it is because of you, Abbu is no longer in this world.  You went away brother, you are right, I understood and I decided to take the right decision, the right decision is to marry you, if now your wife has come back, my wife has come back but my Arup has not come back, but how will this happen, it will happen the same way as it was happening before, we will call four witnesses and do Nikah and you will become my wife, no this is not enough, it is not enough brother, I am marrying you, what else do you want, this is what I wanted earlier but now I want more, you want more, what more do you want now, if you want to marry me then do it in a normal way, bring your parents to my house, talk to my mother, my wedding cards should be distributed, everything should happen in a normal way, now I am not ready for marriage, what nonsense are you talking about, how can all this happen, I have not come to your house with a request for marriage, you came to my house, so keep your voice low and if you find my talks useless and impossible, then hire someone else for this secret marriage of yours Find one, or else live with your wife [Music] [Music] Where are you Mahi [Music] Mother, what happened, crazy girl, why are you crying? Whatever you demanded was absolutely right, I have heard it, I know everything, Amma, he will never agree to that demand, even if you agree to his demand, I am not going to hand over my elder daughter to that mad man. Look, he went mad, first he roamed around like a fool in love with Urup, then on his mother's insistence, he agreed to tie the knot with Fara, and now he is ready to marry you secretly. He went mad, didn't he? You made him a lifelong patient, so look at this man's actions, now that he has found his wife, he has come to you like a filmy hero [Music] I will bring something to eat for you. Your father loved you a lot. There is a fixed time for everyone to leave, do n't burden yourself with that. [Music]
