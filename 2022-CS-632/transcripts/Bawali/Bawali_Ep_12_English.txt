Their introduction, son, these are Amma and Khadim who gave you shelter and took care of you. If these people were not there, I don't know where you would have been. Marriage: This is also a wedding. Neither cards were distributed, nor any rituals were performed, nor mehndi, it's just a marriage in name. Assalam Walekum Aunty [Music] I am giving this jewellery as charity for your happiness and peace. This is Arup's wedding jewellery. By selling this, I know I am doing a very bad thing, but I don't have any other option. Congratulations Aunty, you have a son. Well, congratulations. Well, congratulations. How is my daughter? She is also fine. It means that Roop must have forgotten all the circumstances from the accident till now. I cannot say it with certainty, but Dr Mahsan says that in such cases, the patient remembers everything. How could he do this to me? He used to call me his life. I was sick, I was not dead. He made someone else his life. Assalam Walekum Assalam Bhali [Music] Baba Sha Ki Ja Me Baba [Music] Hey, where did you get this from?

[Music] Yes, Salam Walekum, talk to me. Yes, Aunty too, it's late night, son, you haven't come. So, Mahi is getting married. I don't know about Maai's marriage. You had told me that you are getting married to Fara. Yes, it's after five days. But if you come now, this marriage will be stopped. What happened, son? Everything is fine, isn't it? Aunty too, I will come to my house tomorrow. [Music] [Laughter] Don't worry, I won't become Babli again. No, no, I have never become Babli before. Well, Khairiyt, I laughed like this when I was a child. My mother and father had left me. As much love as Mam gave me, Mamy gave me that much hatred and hatred. I had no friend or sympathizer. When Esan came into my life, I felt that nature had given him to me as a reward for bearing the pain. Die, see what else is there.  It turned out that it is also possible that after your disappearance, Esan sahab might have thought that I am dead. Well, even if he thought so, he would have waited for a year or two [Sangeet] He would have searched for me, he would have done something [Sangeet] But he has agreed to marry not once but twice. The girl whose husband is marrying twice while she is alive, will either cry out loud or laugh like a mad person like me. I am saying something wrong [Sangeet] What can I say about that? Yes, what can you or anyone else say? If it is my problem, then I will have to say it. Now I will neither cry nor remain silent. All my life I have followed the advice of others. I tolerate everything. And now what do you intend to do, my mother? The same thing that he has done to me. What did you tell me? Mahika said, on which day are we kissing? Three days later, I will go home tomorrow. Let's see what is going on between you people. I cannot say anything about this, but it is my moral duty to tell you one thing.  What is it, what do the owners of the cattle farm in which I work, Navi sahab and Esan sahab see? I have full sympathy with you and I will do whatever I can, but I cannot go against the company in which I work. This is not against my principles. Don't worry, I will not ask you to do anything like this. Yes, it is possible that I leave everything for you, after that I will do whatever you say. You have already done a great favour to me, why would I make you unemployed? The one whose crying voice you are hearing is the heir of the future of the company, and the cattle farm is the property of the Alanur company. The owner of the cattle farm is as much Esan as he is my son and till date, I also have more legal rights on Esan. Yes, yes Nazia, my husband is getting ready. As soon as he gets ready and leaves, you manage it. If you are going, then you pick me up. What do you think? Okay then okay bye Navid. Listen, I have increased the budget a bit. Two or three menus of food, you know, please will pay, it's not an issue, you keep increasing the expenses, we are there, why are you bothered about paying, and yes, please, please tell this to Asan, he is not listening to me, buy a new suit for the wedding, then what should you wear, he is saying that he will wear the one from the previous wedding, he is absolutely stupid, has our son gone mad, brother, if there is a new wedding, one should wear a new suit, isn't it, stupid, tell me the truth, if I was getting married, I would have got not one but at least two suits made, you also brought the new one, you brought the second wife and the new suit too, then god, god, what are you saying, nala, my one wife is equal to two or three wives, this gentleman has praised me or taunted me, to tell you the truth, I have left it to your understanding because I know, you are already very intelligent, very funny, now you go to the office, please, I am getting very late, I have a lot of work, okay, bye, see you, funny, okay, Fara will pick me up, then get plain done [Music] [Music] [Music] What happened? Two days are left for your marriage and you are standing sad. This is not even a marriage. Neither cards have been distributed nor any rituals have been performed nor mehndi has been done. It is a marriage. Just see, you are busy in the process of marriage. Even after that, the Nikah takes place. You are not thankful that you have got married in a well-off family. You are going to get a good husband. When will you get some sense? You just keep being sad about the rituals and the cards. You are not thinking that today you are the owner of a small flat but tomorrow you will get a car too. And then you will see, he will take you to Europe, America and all these places. Wow, wow, wow, mummy, what dreams have you shown me. A person who is marrying secretly will take me to Europe, America and all these places. Let the Nikah take place once. You will see, everything will be fine. And I will also see, how long can he keep this Nikah a secret. All these are temporary things. Have a little patience. You will see that whatever Fara has today, you will also get it.  Wealth, status, everything, it seems you have planned everything, you have planned for the future, yes, everything has been done, come on, get well now, crazy girl, aha, hey brother, Esan Miya, Salam Walekum, Alam Walekum, sit, sit, how are you, you came early in the morning, you left your work, you insult me ​​so much, you say so many bad things to me, still I turn my head towards you, hey brother, if you felt bad about something I said, I seek forgiveness, if I felt bad about something, why would I come to you again and again, Russell, I get peace after hearing your bitter words and perhaps I want you to keep abusing me, hey brother, if your only aim is to blame yourself, then why do you make me do this work, do it yourself, why do you come here again and again, abusing yourself, blaming yourself is not in my power, Miya, I am fine, today you are saying very wise things, you are right, to be ashamed of your mistakes, your sins, blaming yourself, this is not in every person's power, only elders reach this stage, if only you  Tell me what is my fault whatever has happened to me We had an accident, Roop lost her memory, she got missing, now Mama wants to get me married as per her wish, what is my fault in this and in the midst of all this you too must be doing something of your own will, you did not mention that, after all it is my life, I will do something as per my wish too, you too laugh amazingly, brother, what do you mean, you yourself are the plaintiff, you yourself are the lawyer and you yourself are the human being, what's the matter, look, you yourself plead about your restlessness and later you argue that you are not responsible for this condition and finally you accept the decision to prove yourself innocent, your words go over my head, seeing this restlessness in you, I get hope that the person inside you is not dead [Sangeet] Son, if any stuff is left behind, I will send it later, why Amma, you want me to never come here again, son, always come again and again, it is your own house, who is stopping you, these will stay here, okay, why that, Madhuri said at one place  I have eaten a lot of food from other places, from Mamu's house to Asan's house, Khala's quarters too, and now here I want you to live in this house with a pardon, good son, as you wish [Music] Amma, will you hug me tightly [Music] My mother, my mother left me when I was a child [Music] Till I was young I used to think that if she was alive, how much would we have loved me, nature saw me and made me a child and brought me to you, you gave me the same love that maybe my mother would have given me in my childhood, I also wished I had a daughter, nature should give me a daughter at this age [Music] Look brother, it seems I was a little late in coming, a very emotional scene was going on here, the relationship between a mother and a daughter is very emotional, you will not understand, let's go, yes, let's go [Music] Amma, let this bag remain, should I leave it here, but why? I came here empty handed and I am taking my entire universe from here, I am not going to take anything else, but what will we do with this stuff, keep it again sometime  If I do n't want to go around then bringing me back here will be of use. Do as you wish. You go, Allah Hafiz A [Music] We will meet again [Music] Nadeem Bhai, I don't know anything. The decor that I have told you should be as it is. No changing and you should not do anything like this from your side. Yes please, what happened Master Sahab, my daughter's wedding is after three days and you are telling me that you will give my dress after a week. I don't know anything, I need the clothes, brother.
