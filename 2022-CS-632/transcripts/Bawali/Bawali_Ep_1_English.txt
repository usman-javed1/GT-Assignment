You okay? yes I came after telling Aroob. We've been sitting here for so long, forget about tea and water, nobody even told Aroob.
I came after telling Aroob. We've been sitting here for so long, forget about tea and water, nobody even told Aroob. It's foolishness of the servants; I just arrived to tell her. See, you both were so eager to come here. How can guests be entrusted to servants here? Don't be angry, you're sitting at your daughter's in-laws' place. What should I do, disgrace myself?.I don't cherish anything more than my dignity. Why should I endure my own disgrace? We haven't come here to beg or borrow like beggars. Uncle. Hey, come here, dear. how's you? I'am good and you? Mee too. Tell me, are you happy here? I'm very happy, don't worry. Aunt.. greetings. how's you? I'am okay.

We have been waiting here for two hours to meet this queen. what do you mean Aunt? leave these matters. Tell me where is Ahsan? Ahsan just arrived. Hey Ahsan how's you? i'am good how's you? i'am alright sit please
Hey Ahsan how's you? i'am good how's you? i'am alright sit please It seems our daughter troubled you a lot. We often remember her mischief. She also misses everyone. And especially, she misses Mahi a lot Actually, she didn't bother me much. laugh. thats good thing Music Thankfully, they have come to meet.
Music Thankfully, they have come to meet. Yes, it's good that we met before finding out. Yes..Who came?
Yes, it's good that we met before finding out. Yes..Who came? Uncle and Mahi Okay...How are they? They're fine, but they were sitting here for quite a while without anyone informing them. They don't come after informing you. No....But there is a guard at home; he could have informed us, right? How stupid is it that they didn't even inform us? Anyway, forget about these things. Tell me, when are you all traveling to Lahore? "We'll leave in just a little while.
Anyway, forget about these things. Tell me, when are you all traveling to Lahore? "We'll leave in just a little while. Okay. Good Have you packed? I haven't packed yet. "There's very little time left, let's go. Mom, Aroob seemed so happy, right? Of course, why wouldn't she be happy? she got lucky."By the way Mahi..I was feeling jealous seeing her. she found such a good in-law's family even without parents. By the way.. Aroob is very lucky I pray to God..that you also find such a good in-law's family, then I will breathe a sigh of relief. OH, God, is that the only topic in girls' lives besides marriage?" I know, there are very few. But a girl's real life changes after marriage. Well, what about the girls whose marriages don't happen in wealthy families? Their fate doesn't change. No, they just adjust to the new home. Look at me, marrying your dad didn't change much. What do you mean, Mom? Are you not happy with Dad? Doesn't he take care of you? Just taking care doesn't fulfill all the desires. Music. Madam, what are you looking at in the dark? Since childhood, my wish has been to see everything clearly in the dark. This is a wish that everyone has. Really? "Yes, wanting to see clearly in the dark signifies that a person wants to know about their future, what is going to happen next. One should always live in the present moment. yes thats right..But the person who isn't present never truly lives; they always live in tomorrow or yesterday. But I wish my situation could somehow be connected to yours in every way. Madom! You're speaking quite poetically on this highway. Live in the moment, for the next moment may be fleeting Ambulance beep.. Music. How are you feeling?Just a little pain in the shoulder and neck, otherwise I'm fine. You're very lucky that your car didn't collide with another and you didn't get more injured. Your car's safety features were also helpful, and you were wearing your seatbelt. Thanks to the seatbelt and airbags, you were saved a lot. Doctor, my wife Arooba... where is she and how is she? She didn't get too injured either. but she.. what she? Actually, you were unconscious for an hour, but your wife regained consciousness shortly afterward. Okay, so is she suffering from a mental illness? Mentaly ill? what are you saying doctor? she is not coming under our control. where is she? Take me to her. Please wait a moment. We have called Professor Doctor Hassan; he is conducting their checkup. "Please take me to Aroob; I want to speak to her. Doctor conduct their checkup, then I'll take you to them. Yeah.. Thank you Music Aroob How's you? Music Aroob My love how's you? I'am Okay. Won't you ask about my condition? How am I? what happend to you. uncle! Music Aroob? Music "I understand this may not be easy for you to accept, but this is the reality. But doctor, how can you say this with such certainty? I agree that this disease isn't common, and many people haven't heard of it before. I don't believe this is possible. What is the name of this disease? Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as we call it, can be treated by doctors in Karachi, America, London, or anywhere else. Nowadays, everything is available on Google; you can search for it there as well." Are you saying that my wife's age will be reduced to 5 or 6 years? Their mental age is that of a 5 or 6-year-old child. Due to this condition, a person can become a victim of depression. So now, will she not recognize me? Not just you, anyone she meets after six years, she forgets everything. "And what is the treatment for this? ese mental conditions often result from accidents or shocks. It's hard to say when or how they occurred, or if they will never fully recover. what's age of your wife? twenty five. So maybe after 20 years, they'll be in the same condition as before the incident. Music. What did Ahsan tell you? He was there, right? He's fine, and so is the daughter-in-law. When I called, they had left Hyderabad and must be arriving soon. God willing, everything will be fine. May my son be safe. Ahsan... Ahsan, are you okay? Nothing happened to you, right? What happened? where is daughter in law? Aroob... Uncle, where have you brought me? Aroob, this is our home. i need to go home. This is your home, Aroob. No, this is not my home. Please take me to my home. crying..Aroob this is also... noo I need to go home, OKAY OKAY  to my uncle's place. Ahsan, what nonsense is she talking? Has she gone mad?
I need to go home, OKAY OKAY  to my uncle's place. Ahsan, what nonsense is she talking? Has she gone mad? Mamma please! Dad, please take mom home. I'll explain everything to you. "I'll bring her along. You take mom there. what she is doing? Aroob please come I'm sending them. let's go Please take her with you.
let's go Please take her with you.  Okay we will go uncle's place Okay Okay.. i promise i promise Please come inside; we will call Mama. Okay i promise Okay? music You do one thing: prepare to take daughter-in-law to the UK. there will definitely be treatment. Dad, I have a friend named Asim who is a psychiatrist in Chicago. I've also spoken to him. what he is saying? He's saying that this condition might not be treated in America or the UK..So that we cannot confirm that the patient will recover or not. So then how will she get better? He was saying that in this condition, a person's memories can get stuck in the past part of their life. However, they can sometimes come back. But it's also possible that their memories may not come back, and they remain stuck. May be. and how will you spend your whole life in such a situation? Ahsan, what do you call this condition? PTSD under regration Whether you call it regression or probation, life cannot be spent with a naive girl. Mamma, how are you talking? She's my wife. Am I saying something wrong? You don't die with the dying, nor do you get sick with the sick. Naila, what nonsense are you talking about? I'm not saying anything wrong, I'm speaking the truth. You should leave her with her uncle, give them some money for monthly expenses. If she recovers, bring her back; otherwise. Mama, I brought Aroob here to spend her whole life with me. If she's not here, then neither will I be. Ahsan... Ahsan.. Ahsan son You've put this person on a pedestal. crazy music Even if I become a sack, my anger subsides, and I completely change May someone hold your hand, may your dignity remain intact. May someone converse like you, may my words be like yours in conversation. May there be a day like your beauty, may your hair be like your night. yes i rpomise No matter how much you change. How you become. i will always love you My beloved, my beauty. My beloved, my beauty.
