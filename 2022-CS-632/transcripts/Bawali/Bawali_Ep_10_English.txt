We girls cannot decide who and how our father will be but we can choose our life partner as per our wish and why do I feel that the man whom I chose of my own free will also break my trust and run away but along with the Nikah Nama, Mahi will have to sign a compromise as well your truth is that you have never loved anyone till date and neither are you in love today you have been pretending to be the person who you are [Music] No, this is such a big city, I don't know what condition my daughter would be in, where are you, here all the wolves are roaming around, there is something else to eat, the baby is not hungry and is there a baby in your womb, I wish I had not called you that day and invited you to the house, Abbu would not have seen us and he would not have died, shh, had I not called you in the morning, then Aroob would not have roamed around, you come to our house everyday, your car is parked outside, then people ask us who is this brother, I told you that you are our future son in law, as the wedding date is coming closer By the way, he is getting away from me. Is Aroob still on his mind? Wow, my lord, wow, what have you done to your mother? The man a girl loves and trusts first is her father. And that man of my life, my father, betrayed me in my childhood and left. We girls cannot take decisions about who and how our father will be, but we can choose our life partner as per our wish. And why do I feel that the man whom I chose as per my wish will also break my trust and run away. Look Farab, for me, marriage is a social contract. I can definitely assure you that I will never break this social contract. Is marriage just a social contract for you? Yes, you are educated and intelligent. What am I saying wrong in this? That is, for you, marriage is just a name of two people's signatures written on a paper. Heart and emotions are not involved in this relationship. Heart and emotions. What do you think that my feelings for Roop have ended or my place in his heart has ended even after the accident?  There were emotions and heart too, but only his mind stopped supporting him and then what remained of our marriage except a paper contract and in the end both of us are husband and wife till today just because of a piece of paper. Here I am talking about Mr. S and I have heart and mind and you too have heart and mind, right? Then why are we getting married because my mind says that if this marriage does not happen then Mama will be shocked and my heart cannot afford this, but yes friend, why do you start this debate again and again, our wedding cards have been made, right? It is not necessary that everyone's marriage or arranged marriages also happen and when two people live with each other, then the heart and emotions also meet and if they do not meet, then brother, see, if you stay with a pet for so long, you get attached to that too, the pet is telling itself, right? You are telling yourself, you have to die saying that I loved this doll like you, Assalam Walekum Walekum Assalam Abba come sit here, I will bring food for you, come sit down brother what's happening today it's only Madhuri, Khadim is not visible, Khadim is too much, we locked him in the room, why, what did he do, he does n't take Madhuri for a walk, oh ho ho, this is a very bad thing, then I will take her for a walk, Khadim doll will take her for a walk, you will not take her [Music] ok then tell me whom do I have to take for a walk, you will take me for a walk, yes let's go now, ok, now this Amma will bring food, let's finish, son, food, oh son, that tai had come, she was saying that the child may not be normal, so consult a lady doctor once, yes son, Bhali Mai was saying that for the sake of a few bucks I cannot put the life of the mother and the child in danger, ok, ok, get up, let's go, where should we go son, that Amma was saying, take me for a walk, so take me for a walk and then come, ok, let's go, come,  Think about it, ok, I will take her out for a walk and then leave, we will eat and then go, Amma, we are going, yes, let's go first, as you wish, son, Amma, you also go, mother, you all go and roam around and come back some other time, ok, let's go, ch ch, hey Mashallah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Aunt also, hello, hello, where is aunt also? I have seen her in the market, what happened, whom did you see comfortably, whom did you see, Roop, where did you see her, I was standing here, she has passed in front of me in a car, I am going behind her, I am going behind her, you do this, you come home immediately, you come home, if I come home, she will again get lost, you should listen to what I am saying, you should come home immediately, and after reaching home, you should just meet me directly, ok, good, where did you come from, it could be an illusion of your eyes, I have grown old but not so old that you cannot recognize your Aroop, your Aroop, okay, let's do this, now in this matter  Let's leave it at that. Yes, don't mention this to anyone else. Look, Khala Di, Aisen is getting married in a few days. You know that if we bring up this Arup episode, then all that drama will start again. Please tell the story of Urup. But Urup is Munne Miya's wife. Khala, I am doing this for the happiness of that Munne Miya. I am his mother. I don't want that my son's life gets filled with happiness and he can live peacefully. But the sister of this house is with unknown people. Who knows what condition she would be in. Khala, when someone dies, do we know what condition he would be in. But our daughter didn't die, Khala, for us, Arup is now dead. What are you saying, Labhi? If you told this to Aisen, then it means that you are not happy with Aisen's happiness and whoever is against my son's happiness, I will not let him stay in this house. What do you mean, that you are understanding me correctly? Look, if the happiness of this house is dear to you, then you will not talk about this to anyone else and if you have any problem, then please leave this house and go to your Arup today itself [Music] [Music] Why should so much money be spent on a cattle farm? According to me, at least this much investment should be made to run a cattle farm in a modern way, the rest is up to you. I have already invested a lot and the income is negligible. You are saying that more money should be spent. Why, look sir, according to my calculation, you will be earning at least 18 to 20 lakhs and if we invest 60 lakhs more on this, then your income will increase to 28 to 30 lakhs and this is a good profit for the company. One minute, one minute, tell me one thing, who told you that my income is 18 to 20 lakh rupees? My income is barely three to four lakh rupees. Sir, how is it possible, according to my calculations?  So this is happening sir sir there seems to be something wrong you see sir I did the calculation [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Amma by the way I don't understand what you are saying what I do n't understand is that how can my and Aesan's marriage remain hidden from everyone it is obvious when all the people of the neighborhood will come then this thing will be revealed in front of everyone yes so what if it is revealed to us then why were you convincing Aesan that our marriage will remain hidden from everyone if it is revealed then let it be revealed and to be honest I also want that everyone should know just Aesan should not know that we told this to everyone [Music] hey mummy what are you saying I will not support you in this type of plan of yours right what nonsense are you talking I am talking nonsense Amma I am saying absolutely right tomorrow Aesan will become my husband I do n't want to put him in any difficulty or trouble hey look just look am I doing all this for myself ok tell me one thing at the time of marriage are you asking me for a house for yourself or not or are you going to live in this rented house all your life  You will continue to live in the house Ammi I don't want anything like this I will not put any such condition for the marriage You may stay dead in this rented house but you will definitely remember these words of mine later You have gone mad completely [Music] You have spoiled it [Music] Son, please tell me a firm date so that I can talk to the Maulvi and the people in advance My wedding function is on the 21st so this is also your wedding Yes, obviously you are right, then keep the date 19th Yes, yes, okay Anyway the Nikah will take place on the 19th But along with the Nikah Nama, mother will also have to sign a consent form Yes, and because you have no objection to my marrying Fara because before my marriage to her you have already become my wife and this will legally not be your second but your third marriage because Fara will not be your second wife but your third wife Yes, son, why will mother refuse to your marriage with Fara And this has already been decided between us, right? I have one more condition as well Condition Yes, the condition is that on the second day of marriage, you people will have to shift from this attachment, but look, I don't want you people to stay in this locality after our marriage, everybody here knows us, it should not happen that the news gets out, where will we go, why in this city, but we cannot get any other house, yes, why would I mind, but I mind, why would I mind because I will not move from one rented house to another rented house, yes, Mahi is saying absolutely right, now you tell yourself, will the daughter-in-law of a family like yours feel good living in a rented house, but I am not asking you for a bungalow or a big house, a small house or a flat which she can call her own so soon, but nowadays even a flat is not available for less than one and a half crore, yes this is true, but brother, look, every girl thinks that she should move from her father's house to her own house, now look, every girl wants her own safety, now tomorrow when she will have children, they will also need a roof, right? What are you thinking, this  I am thinking from where will I arrange so much money at once. Son, what do one or two crores matter to you? Brother, no, that's not the issue. But all the bank accounts are in dad's name. Whatever I need, whenever I need it, I ask him for it. And I am thinking in whose name will I ask for so much money at once. Brother, I am sure you will do something. Now you just tell me in which area to get that flat or house, whatever it is, so that I can talk to the agency people. Okay, I will tell you [Music] Son, I was thinking that so many months have passed since Arup came here. I do n't know what his family must be going through. Amma is right. They must be worried, right? Or Amma, it could also be that they are happy that they lost their lives from this crazy girl. Oh no son, no one can lose their own life from one's own people, no matter how crazy she is, God will know Amma what is right and what is wrong. Well, tell me, did you find out about that lady doctor? Now, there are not many days left. Yes, I spoke to a friend. He told me the address and name of a doctor. He says she is a little expensive and does good work.  yes ma ok then it's fine we will take her tomorrow itself why yes ma ok yes I had to pick up some things Mahi now I will talk to you you are maa right yes and you have come again nana how are you and how come people come here for shopping I guess how did you come here some people come here for shopping and some for window shopping [music] you must have got the wedding card right whose wedding card brother mine and Esan's wedding card aunty did not invite you guys no we did not get the invitation maybe now Aroob is no more so aunty broke the relationship with us but now when the relationship will be re-established then maybe aunty will invite us as well ok brother you guys must come to my party on 21st oh on 21st I will not be able to come at all why what about 2nd that is actually my marriage is on 19th so you know two days after the marriage it will be a little difficult ok congratulations to you in advance ok then I am leaving see you stupid girl you could have at least asked who am I getting married to on 19th [music]  I cannot understand what is happening to me It seems as if I am stuck in a swamp The more I try to pull myself out, the more I am being defied You are a liar What lies have I told you You keep lying to yourself and keep on saying I lie to myself Yes, and now you are unable to bear the weight of that lie I am sorry I am not able to understand What are you trying to say ok tell me the truth The truth why do you come to me Maybe so that you can give me some advice Tell me some such thing which can bring peace in my life Then you are talking nonsense Then you are lying again You come to me only because you want to hear your truth from me Consciousness does not lie and neither do I lie But your truth is that you have never loved anyone till date nor have you been pretending to be a person which you are not You are a hungry and demanding person from inside who cannot see anything except his hunger and desire What are you saying in front of you but you were not able to see her because she was not able to satisfy your physical desires you call this love, you don't tell the truth to others, nor to yourself, why are you going to board two boats, two boats? Yes, why did you not decide to board two boats together? Yes, then why do you complain that you are going to get stuck in a swamp? Who told you this? I mean, how do you know that I tell the truth, that's why I hear the truth of others? [Music] I am such a bad person, I had no idea about this. You roam around wearing the mask of a very good person, actually you are an ordinary person, that's why you remain more troubled. Then you tell me what should I do? Tell me the truth, uru, uru my child, where had you gone? I went mad looking for you, son. Now I have found my aunt, yes, son, who are these people? This is Amma and that Khadim. Assalam Walekum Walekum Assalam Adi. My son found her standing alone on the road. Yes, I am saying the right thing.  We had even filed a police report. I swear by Allah that we did not bring her here by force. Now if you want, you can ask them yourself. No, sister, I am not thinking like that. You people seem like very good people to me. But how come you have come here all day long. That is why you have brought her for a checkup. It would have been better if you had got her checked up first and then we would have sat and talked peacefully. [Sangeet] Adi, she is your daughter, she was a trust with us. You may take her. Aunt is also dead to us. And if Aroob is dearer to you than the happiness of this house, then you can leave this house and go from here right now. [Sangeet] Adi, what are you thinking? No, no, nothing. Adi, I will pack Aroop's belongings. You may take her. No, no, there are some issues right now. When the situation gets better, I will come and take her. You keep her with you for some time. Here, son, put your number in it and save my number. This is fine. I have done this. But right now, I cannot tell you anything more. But in short, this is that  Arub is an orphan girl and daughter-in-law of a very big businessman of the city. After marriage, she became mentally 6 years old in an accident. Yes, then take her along. Why are you not taking her along? I will tell you the details later. But Doctor Shaila says that it is possible that she may deliver next week and she will try to ensure that the baby is normal and there is no need for an operation. Look Aadi, we are very poor people. We have taken care of your daughter for our own good. This goodness should not become a burden on us. No, sister, there is nothing like that. Since you have been so kind, keep her for some more time for my sake. And yes Doctor Shaila will not take even a rupee from you. You are here. You will stay here now. No, son, I am leaving but I will keep coming. Okay, next time when you come, I will bring my Shahrukh. Yes, son, now when I come, I will bring your doll. Okay, I will wait for you Aadi. You are going but we will be worried behind. You came to meet your daughter after such a long time and then you are not taking her along as well. If not, the fact is that the daughter's mother-in-law is not  I want her to come home oh why what crime has the girl committed she is unlucky her poor mother-in-law did not like her anyway and on top of that she became mad in the accident and her husband does not love her respect no no he is very good but he is helpless in front of his mother and now she is getting him married again and in such a situation if Urub goes there then everything will be spoiled so then this means will you never take Roop home no no it is not like that when Uroop gives birth to a child then I will talk to her father-in-law and take her to our house as long as my trust is with you it is fine Adi you should not be worried she is our daughter too [Sangeet]
