[0.04] Their
[2.76] introduction, son, these are Amma and Khadim
[7.20] who gave you shelter and took care of you.
[11.12] If these people were not there, I don't know
[14.40] where you would have been. Marriage: This is also a
[18.32] wedding. Neither cards were distributed, nor any rituals were performed, nor
[22.84] mehndi, it's just a marriage in name.
[26.36] Assalam Walekum Aunty
[35.78] [Music]
[47.48] I am giving this jewellery as charity for your happiness and peace.
[51.60] This is Arup's wedding
[56.44] jewellery. By selling this, I know I am doing a
[60.20] very bad thing,
[61.88] but I don't have any other option. Congratulations Aunty, you have a
[64.56] son. Well, congratulations.
[68.92] Well, congratulations. How is my daughter? She is also fine. It
[72.04] means that Roop must have
[75.56] forgotten all the circumstances from the accident till now. I cannot
[79.16] say it with certainty, but Dr
[81.08] Mahsan says that in such cases, the patient
[83.92] remembers everything. How could he do this to me? He used to
[91.64] call me his life.
[94.68] I was sick, I was not dead.
[98.76] He made someone else his life.
[103.40] Assalam Walekum Assalam

[570.00] disappearing from the office the whole day he doesn't feel like working he

[595.40] n't let it be he is getting married after a day
[598.84] he will be in Fara's radar
[600.85] [Music]
[606.36] hello what has happened why are you acting cold at this age
[612.56] what should I
[614.76] tell you at this age the only
[617.24] wish of a person is to play with children with
[619.76] their grandchildren and husbands I don't
[627.24] know where Roop will be
[632.12] her
[634.28] child in what condition will my grand child be I do
[643.36] n't know if I have become a grandfather or not don't be disheartened
[647.40] inshallah very soon the
[650.76] sounds of Asen's children playing will be
[653.64] echoing in our house too
[657.04] and I  So tell Fara that
[659.80] I want a son as my first child,
[662.60] Inshallah,
[665.40] Inshallah,
[667.60] our son Esan's first child will be
[672.08] born from the womb of a man,
[675.44] whether it is a daughter or a son.
[682.28] [Music]
[690.56] Yes, Salam Walekum, talk to me. Yes,
[699.44] Aunty too, it's late night, son, you haven't come. So,
[710.20] Mahi is getting married. I don't know about Maai's marriage.
[715.24] You had told me that you are getting
[719.72] married to Fara. Yes, it's after five days.
[723.16] But if you come now, this marriage will be stopped.
[728.24] What happened, son? Everything is fine, isn't it?
[732.24] Aunty
[735.44] too, I will come to my house tomorrow.
[758.01] [Music]
[760.08] [Laughter] Don't
[770.80] worry, I won't become Babli again. No, no,
[775.04] I have never become Babli before. Well,
[782.68] Khairiyt, I laughed like this when I was a
[786.28] child.
[789.04] My mother and father had left me.
[793.76] As much love as Mam gave me,
[797.80] Mamy gave me that much hatred and hatred. I had no
[801.20] friend or
[804.72] sympathizer. When Esan came into my life, I
[808.36] felt that nature had given him to me
[812.36] as a reward for bearing the pain.
[815.48] Die,
[817.92] see what else is there.  It turned out that it is also possible
[822.96] that after your disappearance, Esan sahab might have thought that
[827.52] I am dead.
[830.32] Well, even if he thought so, he would have waited for a year or two
[836.51] [Sangeet] He would have
[839.36] searched for me, he would have done something
[841.40] [Sangeet]
[843.28] But he has
[848.72] agreed to marry not once but twice. The
[858.20] girl whose husband is marrying twice while she is alive, will either cry out loud or
[861.84] laugh like a mad person like me. I am saying something wrong
[868.22] [Sangeet] What can
[870.64] I say about that?
[873.00] Yes, what can you or anyone else say? If it is
[877.88] my problem, then I will have to say it.
[881.68] Now I will neither
[885.12] cry nor
[888.48] remain silent. All my life I have followed the advice of others. I
[893.68] tolerate everything. And
[897.36] now
[900.68] what do you intend to do, my mother? The same thing that
[906.04] he has done to me.
[910.48] What did you tell me? Mahika said, on which day are we
[915.24] kissing?
[918.68] Three days
[922.40] later, I will go home tomorrow. Let's
[924.56] see what is going on between you people.
[927.04] I cannot say anything about this,
[929.80] but it is my moral duty to tell you one
[931.64] thing.  What is
[934.88] it, what do the owners of the cattle farm in which I work,
[941.08] Navi sahab and Esan
[944.04] sahab see? I have full sympathy with you
[948.20] and I will do whatever I can,
[952.08] but I
[954.56] cannot go against the company in which I work. This is not
[958.36] against my principles. Don't worry,
[961.72] I will not ask you to do anything like this. Yes,
[966.20] it is possible that I leave everything for you,
[967.92] after that I will do whatever you say.
[971.04] You have already done a great favour to me,
[974.68] why would I make you unemployed? The one whose
[983.84] crying voice you are hearing is the
[986.88] heir of the future of the company,
[993.44] and the cattle
[995.88] farm is the property of the Alanur company. The
[1004.76] owner of the cattle farm is as much Esan as he is
[1009.48] my son
[1011.44] and
[1015.76] till date, I also have more legal rights on Esan.
[1043.40] Yes, yes Nazia, my husband is getting ready.
[1047.60] As soon as he gets ready and leaves, you
[1050.60] manage it. If you are going, then
[1053.32] you pick me up. What do you think? Okay then okay
[1059.08] bye
[1062.32] Navid. Listen, I have increased the budget a bit.
[1066.44] Two or three menus of food, you know,
[1069.84] please will pay, it's not
[1072.96] an issue, you keep increasing the expenses,
[1076.80] we are there, why are
[1078.88] you bothered about paying, and yes, please, please tell this to Asan, he is
[1081.84] not listening to me,
[1084.48] buy a new suit for the wedding, then what should you
[1087.12] wear, he is saying that he will wear the one from the previous wedding, he is
[1090.16] absolutely stupid, has our son gone mad,
[1092.88] brother, if there is a new wedding, one should
[1095.64] wear a new suit, isn't it,
[1099.24] stupid, tell me the truth, if I was getting married,
[1102.88] I would have got not one but at least two suits made,
[1109.20] you also brought the new one, you brought the second wife and the new suit
[1112.84] too, then god, god, what are you saying, nala,
[1117.68] my one wife is equal to two or three wives,
[1121.96] this gentleman has praised me or taunted me, to
[1128.44] tell you the truth, I have left it to your understanding because I know,
[1132.56] you are already very
[1136.00] intelligent, very funny, now you go to the office, please,
[1139.92] I am getting very late, I have a lot of work,
[1143.44] okay, bye, see you, funny, okay,
[1150.20] Fara will pick me up, then get plain
[1156.56] done
[1158.40] [Music]
[1164.47] [Music]
[1172.23] [Music]
[1182.64] What happened? Two days are left for your marriage
[1185.64] and you are standing sad.
[1188.32] This is not even a
[1192.24] marriage. Neither cards have been distributed nor any rituals have been performed nor
[1196.72] mehndi has been done. It is a marriage.
[1198.92] Just
[1200.72] see, you are busy in the process of marriage. Even after that, the
[1204.56] Nikah takes place. You are not thankful
[1206.92] that you have got married in a well-off family.
[1211.72] You are going to get a good husband. When will you get some sense?
[1215.76] You just keep being sad about the rituals and the cards. You are
[1218.84] not thinking that today you are the
[1222.20] owner of a small flat but tomorrow
[1225.44] you will get a car too. And then you will see, he will take
[1228.16] you to Europe, America and all these places.
[1232.88] Wow, wow, wow, mummy, what dreams have
[1236.20] you shown me. A person who is marrying secretly will
[1239.28] take me to Europe, America
[1241.96] and all these places.
[1244.28] Let the Nikah take place once. You will see,
[1247.60] everything will be fine. And I will also see,
[1249.84] how long can he keep this Nikah a secret.
[1252.56] All these are temporary things. Have a little patience.
[1255.84] You will see that whatever Fara has today,
[1259.28] you will also get it.  Wealth, status,
[1263.84] everything, it seems you have planned everything, you have planned for the
[1267.20] future,
[1269.16] yes, everything has been done, come on, get well now,
[1275.56] crazy girl, aha, hey
[1294.72] brother, Esan Miya, Salam Walekum, Alam
[1298.80] Walekum, sit, sit, how are you, you came early in the morning,
[1303.92] you left your work, you insult me ​​so much, you
[1306.40] say so many bad things to me, still I turn my head towards you,
[1308.20] hey brother,
[1313.84] if you felt bad about something I said, I seek forgiveness, if I felt bad about something,
[1317.20] why would I come to you again and again,
[1321.60] Russell, I get peace after hearing your bitter words
[1328.56] and
[1330.40] perhaps I want
[1333.04] you to keep abusing me, hey brother, if your only aim is to
[1336.56] blame yourself, then why do you make me
[1339.20] do this work, do it yourself, why do you come here again and again, abusing yourself, blaming
[1348.76] yourself is
[1352.08] not in my power, Miya, I am fine, today you are saying very wise things, you are
[1357.00] right, to be ashamed of your mistakes, your sins,
[1361.80] blaming yourself,
[1364.76] this is not in every person's power, only
[1368.68] elders reach this stage,
[1372.68] if only you  Tell me what is
[1376.16] my fault whatever has happened to me
[1378.80] We had an accident, Roop lost her memory,
[1380.56] she got missing, now Mama
[1384.20] wants to get me married as per her wish,
[1386.08] what is my fault in this and in the midst of all this you too must be
[1391.24] doing something of your own will,
[1394.00] you did not mention that, after all it is my life, I will
[1398.04] do something as per my wish too,
[1399.92] you too laugh amazingly, brother, what do you mean, you yourself are the
[1405.00] plaintiff, you yourself are the lawyer and you yourself are the
[1407.96] human being,
[1410.76] what's the matter, look, you yourself plead about your restlessness
[1415.08] and later you argue
[1418.20] that you are not responsible for this condition and
[1422.36] finally you accept the decision to prove yourself innocent,
[1428.16] your words go over my head,
[1432.44] seeing this restlessness in you, I get
[1436.68] hope that the person inside you is
[1438.88] not dead
[1440.68] [Sangeet]
[1457.80] Son, if any stuff is left behind, I will send it later,
[1464.16] why Amma, you want me to never come
[1468.08] here again, son, always come again and again, it is
[1472.00] your own house, who is stopping
[1476.96] you, these will stay here, okay,
[1482.24] why that, Madhuri said at one place  I have
[1486.52] eaten a lot of food from other places, from Mamu's house to Asan's
[1491.20] house,
[1493.00] Khala's
[1496.28] quarters too, and now here
[1501.44] I want you to live in this house
[1506.80] with a pardon, good son, as
[1511.80] you
[1518.64] wish [Music] Amma, will you
[1533.60] hug me tightly
[1536.36] [Music]
[1558.36] My
[1559.60] mother, my mother left me when I was a child
[1562.72] [Music]
[1564.44] Till I was young I used to think
[1567.44] that if she was alive,
[1572.64] how much would we have loved me,
[1578.04] nature saw me and made me a child
[1582.28] and brought me to you,
[1584.48] you gave me the same love that
[1589.24] maybe my mother would have given me in my childhood, I
[1593.32] also wished I had a daughter,
[1599.48] nature should
[1601.76] give me a daughter at this age
[1605.47] [Music] Look
[1612.40] brother, it seems I was a little late
[1616.04] in coming, a very emotional scene was going on here, the
[1619.68] relationship between a mother and a daughter is very
[1621.80] emotional, you will not
[1624.32] understand, let's go, yes, let's go
[1637.25] [Music]
[1639.60] Amma, let this bag remain, should I
[1644.52] leave it here, but why?
[1649.24] I came here empty handed
[1652.68] and I am taking my entire universe from here, I am
[1656.84] not going to take anything else, but
[1660.72] what will we do with this stuff, keep it again sometime  If I do
[1664.84] n't want to go around then bringing me back here will be of use. Do
[1669.44] as you
[1672.40] wish. You go, Allah Hafiz A
