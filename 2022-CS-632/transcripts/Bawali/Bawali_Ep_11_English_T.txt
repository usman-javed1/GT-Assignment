[0.00] and every month we'll keep buying 2 to 3 buffaloes, then our accounts will be balanced
[9.41] but sir, this is dishonesty
[13.50] and how will I do this robbery & why?
[15.43] but these are Aroob's wedding jewelry
[18.13] by selling them... 
[19.27] I know I am doing such a vile act but... 
[22.92] I have no other option
[26.26] what do you want, tell me
[28.21] aunty, where is Ahsan? 
[30.55] I didn't see him
[33.22] Dear, have you become fine?
[35.79] yes aunty, I am fine
[50.21] When a person dies, do we know in what condition they are in?
[54.41] but our child hasn't died yet
[57.22] Aroob is dead for us now
[59.76] I am not asking you for a big house or a bungalow
[63.46] a small house or a flat
which she can call hers
[68.62] But nowadays, even a flat doesn't cost less than one crore or so
[72.97] Okay, then I am inviting you
do come on 21st
[76.78] Oh... I won't be able to come on the 21st
[80.66] Why? What's there on the 21st?
[83.44] actually, I am getting married on the 19th
[86.89] haven't you decided to balance yourself between two boats at the same time?
[90.98] you...
[91.68] Then why do you complain about getting stuck in quicksand?
[96.59] Once Aroob will deliver the baby
Then I will take her to my house after discussing it with her father-in-law
[102.55] until then she is my mandate with you
[105.59] okay sister, don't you worry
[113.70] dear, this new guy Khadim
[117.63] since he has handled the cattle farm
[120.37] All praise to God, our earning has increased to 400%
[125.74] yes dad, he seems to be very wise & skillful guy
[130.57] hmm... he is skillful as well as honest guy
[137.80] I was thinking..
[139.88] upon his suggestion
[142.22] I should invest more in the cattle farm
[145.25] what do you say?
[147.65] as you find better, dad
[155.35] but then I am thinking that...
[158.47] at least monitor him for a month, then we'll do the investment
[166.08] do one thing
[168.15] Handle all the accounts yourself from today onwards
[172.67] in fact, tell Khadim to inform you about everything
[177.11] ok dad
[179.20] dad, I need some money
[183.92] hmm.. tell me, how much?
[188.34] I need a little more
[191.44] but at least tell me, how much?
[193.94] dad, actually a friend wants almost 1.15 crore rupees
[199.87] 1.15 crore rupees?
[201.95] dad, I will give him as a loan he will return it
[212.64] dear look...
[216.01] one should not give a loan in friendship
[220.10] we aren't a bank to give loan
[224.64] do one thing
[226.51] If it's a matter of 10 to 15 lakhs, just give it to him like that
[230.89] but as a help, not as a loan. Ok?
[238.32] No dad, 10 to 15 lacs won't be helpful for him
[242.98] dear... 
[244.77] the matter is not about 1 crore or 2 crore, its about rules
[248.98] and look, everything is yours after me
[253.17] but remember one thing
[256.02] there shouldn't be trade of money in friendship
[260.82] it makes bad impact on the friendship
[271.86] yes, send him
[281.08] Khadim
[282.64] today on wards, you will show all the accounts to Mr. Ahsan
[287.71] okay sir
ok?
[294.18] my child, you were missing you male doll right?
see, I have brought it with me, see
[301.02] Shahrukh is here. Wow! see Madhuri will be so happy now
[309.28] sister, please sit let me bring tea for you
[314.09] I want to eat "bhusri"
[316.40] bhusri?
[317.93] yes sister, what you call sweet flatbread
[320.95] okay dear, let me bring it for you too
Ok
[328.89] why are you staring at him?
[331.76] he is so bad
[334.14] a lot of days have passed & he didn't miss his Madhuri
[340.59] but now Madhuri have got Khadim
[343.25] she got Khadim?
[344.99] yes! Madhuri got a new male doll & he is so nice
[349.47] and mom has kept his name as "Khadim"
[353.52] he is also good
[356.87] No! he is not good
[360.28] he didn't miss his Madhuri, he left her
[364.19] take him away with you, as Madhuri is upset with him
[367.79] but, he is Madhuri's husband & she loves him so much
[375.10] now Madhuri will get married to Khadim, & then he will love her
[390.95] hmm... 
[393.44] very good
[397.20] you have handled the work very well
[403.03] and the good thing is that... 
[406.16] You got the dishonest employees fired
[409.68] Good!
[411.16] yes sir, because the company was getting less profit because of their dishonesty
[416.39] hmm... 
[418.78] ok tell me, what's the cost of our one buffalo?
[427.55] almost around 5 lacs
[431.44] hmm... 
[436.58] so if we sell off around 25 buffaloes, then it makes 1.15 crore rupees
[442.75] sir, means you are telling me to sell the buffaloes?
[447.08] why sir?
[448.07] No no, actually I was thinking about something else
[454.42] By the way, Dad has started to trust you so much
[459.14] so can I trust you too?
[462.97] absolutely sir
[464.90] you can trust me, I am your servant so I will stay loyal to you
[468.94] No no, I don't like this word servant or so
[473.89] you are an employee
[475.64] ok tell me something, if I ask you keep a secret so will you be able to do it?
[486.16] absolutely sir! you are my boss & its not possible that I shall reveal your words outside
[491.81] you won't even tell me dad?
[495.51] to the boss, sir?
but why do I have to hide it from him?
[499.86] I am asking you just like that, what if you had to hide it then?
[505.47] So sir, you are also my boss. I am an employee of both of you, so I will obey the orders of both of you
[513.00] good!
[516.24] I want you to sell the buffaloes for 1.15 crores
[521.90] means, sir you want me to sell of almost 25 to 30 animals?
[526.77] yes
[532.69] sell them off & that too within next 3 days
[539.16] but sir, if boss gets to know about it then what will I tell him?
[544.21] Why? Why will he get to know?
[547.99] you shall show less profit margin
[551.53] and every month we'll keep buying 2 to 3 buffaloes, then our accounts will be balanced
[560.99] but sir, this is dishonesty
[565.05] and how will I do this robbery & why?
[568.06] its our business, & the buffaloes are ours
[571.84] and I am taking the money
[574.40] So, where does the dishonesty or robbery come from?
[579.57] Sorry sir, I cannot do this work of yours
[585.73] if you want you can fire me & hire someone else. I am leaving
[589.65] listen
[593.58] I was just taking your test
[597.75] you've passed
[601.17] Why would I make changes in my own company?
[605.76] okay sir, shall I leave now?
[608.05] thank you!
[617.11] what shall I do? From where I shall get such a hefty amount?
[625.65] what to do? Mahi won't agree without an apartment
[632.56] yes... this can be done
[645.72] mom, enough is enough! We've seen almost ten flats
[649.14] please confirm the last flat that we saw
[652.11] no no, wait. Its not an easy task to buy a house on a daily basis. We'll make a decision after thinking long & hard
[660.18] really?
[662.45] We don't even know whether Ahsan has arranged the money or not
[666.55] what do you mean?
[669.02] He didn't arrange the money? He doesn't lack any money though
[672.50] he roams around in a car worth 1.5 crores
[674.88] Mom, that car is not his own. He got it from the office
[678.88] besides, uncle has also refused to give him the money
[683.16] he has refused?
[685.12] then why are we searching for a flat like crazy people?
[687.97] Yes, but Ahsan said that he will arrange the money, and I should keep searching for a flat
[694.01] Thank God! You've almost killed me
[697.76] by the way do you know, these influential people have many connections
[704.91] yes, he was saying that he will arrange the money by tomorrow
[709.03] okay, thank God
[712.02] by the way, I was thinking about something
[714.50] If your dad were alive, he would be very happy
[720.32] what happened, what are you thinking?
[725.00] If Dad were alive, nothing like this would be happening
[731.28] why?
[732.82] Wasn't our happiness dear to him?
[736.36] His respect was much more dear to him than our happiness
[742.10] His respect was more dear to him than his own life
[745.83] Respect, happiness, life... what are you saying?
[750.13] have you also gone crazy like Aroob?
[753.30] don't know what came into this girl's mind
[756.87] She understands something else and listens to something else when I say anything to her
[777.83] mom
[778.93] yes?
[781.01] I want to discuss something with you
[785.57] yes, sit. Tell me what's the matter?
[789.94] mom, where is Aroob's jewelry?
[795.49] its with me, why?
[798.30] I want it
[800.20] you want it, why?
[804.91] do you remember my friend Rasheed?
[808.95] hmm... 
[810.55] yes, you might have some friend Rasheed. So tell me
[815.33] its her sister's wedding
[817.54] they are needy so I wanted to help them
[821.34] that's why I am thinking to gift them the jewelry
[826.07] haven't you gone mad? Its such an expensive jewelry
[831.28] and you are saying that you'll gift it to your friend
[835.66] are you like in your senses?
[837.45] so what will you do of it?
[839.46] I will give it to your to-be wife. I will give them to Farah, what else?
[843.97] mom
[845.84] you want Farah to wear Aroob's used things?
[852.28] you are a fool, these aren't clothes or so
[856.10] its a jewelry, its Gold!
[858.48] There is nothing called 'used' in it.
[861.36] you guys aren't understanding my point
[865.63] dear, can you please explain me what we don't understand?
[871.22] mom look...
yes
[873.62] if Farah will come in front of me after wearing Aroob's jewelry then
[878.65] I will keep missing Aroob
[880.62] Oh... 
[883.65] okay
[885.33] So, let me do one thing. Let me melt these sets and change them into new sets
[894.29] are you happy?
[895.57] No, I am not happy. You are not understanding
[900.12] I did wrong with Aroob, I did so much of injustice with her
[905.88] And if I want to gift her jewelry as repentance, then what's the harm in it?
[917.61] hmm.. 
[921.77] okay
[941.55] here you go, dear
[943.12] I am donating this jewelry for your happiness and peace
[949.58] thank you mom, thank you so much!
[952.96] okay, you have to promise me one thing
[957.18] anything
[959.22] you won't tell all this to dad, please
[963.74] okay
[966.10] Because if you tell him, he won't understand my feelings and he will scold me
[972.66] promise me
[975.73] promise
[977.30] love you, thank you!
[978.95] thank you!
[988.26] these are gold sets
[992.09] The receipts are inside the boxes; sell them to cover the cost of the apartment
[1005.24] but these are Aroob's wedding jewelry
[1009.68] by selling them... 
[1010.85] I know I am doing such a vile act but... 
[1014.48] I have no other option
[1019.52] oh no dear, what's vile in it?
[1022.88] A person sells off jewelry in times of need
[1026.54] keep it Maheen
[1031.29] No, if you don't like doing it then keep it with you. I don't want to by any flat
[1037.34] Mahi
[1039.44] I feel like doing a lot for you, but right now I am helpless
[1044.91] I am not asking you for anything
[1047.59] yes dear, don't worry. And see, Mahi is not asking for any jewelry or clothes for her wedding
[1055.23] She will wear my old jewelry
[1057.88] She is just worried about you that you don't worry
[1066.86] I think you are feeling guilty
[1071.22] yes, you are right
[1075.77] I think that... 
[1078.48] first, I had deceived Aroob
[1082.87] then I lost Aroob
[1087.51] and now... 
[1090.61] I am selling Aroob's mementos
[1093.22] oho, now don't bring anything bad in your minds on this joyous occasion
[1100.61] dear sit, let me bring tea for you
[1103.53] and give it to me, let me keep them inside
[1149.30] mom...
[1151.43] what happened, dear?
[1152.65] mom, its hurting...
[1156.21] is it hurting?
[1157.99] okay, wait a second...
[1160.51] Okay, let me wake up Khadim then we'll go to the hospital
[1165.64] one minute, my child have some patience
[1169.71] stay straight my child, please
[1172.82] Khadim...

[1176.05] Khadim... dear
[1179.59] mom...
[1198.04] dear, did you call her?
[1201.13] yes mom, I had called her she must be here in a while
[1203.65] Okay, I hope she comes here soon
[1207.08] is everything fine?
[1209.04] yes yes, may God keep everything better
[1212.40] if God wills
[1216.32] aunty, I think we need to operate
[1218.62] but you were saying that its a normal case
[1221.70] Aroob is not cooperating at all, and how shall I proceed without a mother's cooperation?
[1226.48] I have to give her an anesthesia
[1228.16] okay doctor, as you feel better
[1230.85] okay, let me start the preparation for operation
[1236.17] sister, our daughter is a child herself
[1239.96] what she'll do after gaining back her conscience?
[1244.22] you are right, sister
[1246.29] just pray that everything goes well
[1249.66] my Lord... make ease for our child
Amen
[1254.41] and everything shall happen finely
[1257.54] Ameen Ameen
[1259.78] oh Lord...
[1283.77] congratulations aunty, its a boy
[1287.17] congratulations to you too!

[1299.84] its such a joyous occasion
[1302.34] congratulations, heartiest congratulations to you!
[1306.01] congratulations to you too
[1308.67] sister, if you hadn't supported this helpless girl then...
[1312.62] oh my sister, what's the matter of doing a favor here
[1317.62] Aroob is my daughter as well.
 doctor can we meet our daughter?
[1324.10] yes, she will gain her conscience in a while then you can meet her
[1328.25] okay
[1331.85] Thanks to my Lord
[1339.66] *playing with the baby*
[1347.60] see, he is holding my hand
[1352.06] hello!
[1356.88] really?
[1359.03] okay, I am coming right away
[1362.93] all good?
[1364.03] Everything is fine, Mom. I received a call from the guard at the cattle farm. There's a small problem, so I have to leave
[1370.38] okay, then I am staying here
[1374.93] Okay, but you must be tired. I was suggesting that I could drop you home
[1380.07] ok dear
[1381.17] Yes sister, you've been here and awake since last night. You can go now; I am here with my daughter
[1387.81] Okay
[1389.54] take care of Aroob, ok?
yes yes
[1391.72] also of the baby
[1392.64] ok aunty, I am leaving. Do let me know as soon as they discharge her
[1397.62] I will come to pick you guys
[1399.58] okay dear
[1402.55] okay
[1407.47] Bye
bye!
[1411.69] *playing with the baby*
[1434.76] aunty...
[1436.94] this is my daughter's small baby
[1450.86] aunty..
[1453.47] is he my baby?
[1455.09] yes dear
[1456.54] he is your baby
[1478.73] what do you want, tell me
[1480.78] aunty, where is Ahsan? I didn't see him
[1485.78] Dear, have you become fine?
[1488.42] yes aunty, I am fine
[1496.81] how are you, Aroob?
[1498.34] I am fine, doctor
[1511.80] I spoke with the renowned psychologist Dr. Mohsin, and he said Aroob was in great pain before her baby's delivery
[1519.99] During that pain, her head got stuck to the bed and then she became unconscious because of our medicine
[1526.62] Due to that, her brain suffered severe damage
[1529.73] maybe that's why she got well
[1532.59] So, does she remember everything now?
[1535.19] yes yes, according to doctor Mohsin whatever happened is not less than a miracle
[1540.79] but... 
but what?
[1542.67] We need to see if Aroob has remembered everything from her past, but particularly whether she remembers the last 7 months or not
[1548.83] Does this mean that Aroob has forgotten all the incidents and situations that occurred until now after the accident?
[1555.12] We cannot be sure, but according to Dr. Mohsin, he says a patient remembers everything in a blurry manner
[1561.78] So, there is a possibility that Aroob might remember a few things from the past 7 months
[1566.66] what shall I do now?
[1568.14] hey, why are you getting worried? You should tell this good news to her husband & family
[1574.80] Aroob has given birth to a baby boy and she is doing well now
[1578.21] good news?
[1579.72] This news will hit that household like a disaster
[1583.35] as a disaster! why so?
[1585.65] oh doctor, its a long story
[1589.60] please tell me, can I talk to Aroob about the last 7 months?
[1594.14] I'm not a psychologist, but I would suggest not to mentally burden her
[1600.55] okay, better. Thank you!
[1606.76] Bye!
bye...
[1616.10] dear, do you remember you had an accident?
[1620.42] yes, aunty
[1623.20] maybe, Ahsan & I was there
[1626.00] while going to Lahore, nearby Hyderabad
[1629.96] do you remember anything after that?
[1631.78] aunty, I don't remember it very well
[1635.52] very strange things comes into my mind
[1639.07] don't know whether all that had happened or...
[1642.62] maybe it was my dream
[1644.58] what do you get in your mind?
[1646.88] very strange things...
[1650.56] as if its a scene of some drama
[1655.21] I cannot recall anything completely, aunty
[1658.33] try to recall it, dear
[1674.87] And tell me, when did you last meet your uncle?
[1691.79] uncle was going after leaving me
[1695.20] I was crying very loudly
[1699.42] why was I crying?
[1701.73] okay do you remember anything about sister Naila?
[1721.97] her behavior was so bad with me
[1727.50] Aunty, is all of it true?
[1730.53] Ahsan?
[1734.79] aunty...
[1738.99] Did Mahi used to come to my house?
[1742.65] that girl had been treated very badly as well
[1745.89] If I don't tell her the whole truth, I will also be causing a lot of harm to her
[1754.66] what are you thinking?
[1759.05] dear, I will tell you everything but promise me that you won't be emotional & listen to me with a calm mind
[1768.02] yes, tell me
[1770.32] Dear, you've been acting like a 6-year-old girl for the past seven months
[1776.45] what?
[1779.28] like a 6 year old girl?
[1780.57] Yes dear, mentally you became like a 6-year-old girl after the accident
[1864.37] what?
[1867.31] aunty, uncle left me all alone?
[1873.47] and Ahsan?
[1878.16] how can Ahsan do this to me?
[1884.13] he used to call me his life
[1887.42] Aunty, I was sick, but I didn't die
[1892.25] he made someone else his life
[1899.49] I don't agree that Ahsan will change like this
[1903.62] aunty, I want to see the face of this new Ahsan
[1911.67] I want to meet Ahsan
[1914.16] dear, if you say so then shall I call him here?
[1917.73] No
[1920.57] we'll go home from here
[1925.53] until then you won't tell anything to anyone
