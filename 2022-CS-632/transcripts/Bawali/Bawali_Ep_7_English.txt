If you add more water to it, it will overflow, right? right You are filled up like water, in that way. So empty yourself to find the path inward. but how? Stop fighting within yourself. which fight? How conflict? There's no conflict going on inside me I'm not understanding which conflict you're referring to. The struggle between your physical desires and your emotions. Okay, forget that. Tell me, what is troubling you? Simply ,my issue is that i loved Aroob But along with that, I've started liking another girl. but My mom doesn't approve of my choice for me. See, it was such a simple matter that you couldn't say it. Now that you've said this thing surely you'll find some solution for it You think this issue seems small. Oh my dear, no issue is small or big. We make it big or small ourselves. Alright, for today, that's enough. You go now. Today, you've accomplished a lot. Which accomplishment? To tell me the truth Today, you've honestly told yourself what your situation is. and you will find solution too music oh hi aroob..hello aunt how's you? who are you? i'am farah...farah aunt?

I was having coffee with Naila at the caf√©. Suddenly, she felt chest pain, so I brought her here immediately. For several days, she had been complaining of pain in her left arm. But she didn't mention anything to me about it. She had been very stressed for quite a few days. she was saying that their distress has become unbearable for me. which problem? What kind of problems could a mother have with her children? It seems like she was stressed because of you. Ahsan?...Ahsan what happend? everthing will be fine If something happens to mom, I'll never forgive myself. nothing will happen to her, or it's all my fault. Nothing can happen to my mom. ahsan what happend?  Keep your chin up, everything will be alright. Dad.... Doctor come Dr. How is Naila now? Look Nazia, your sister's heart valves were both closed. I opened one with a stent. But they didn't do anything for the other one   because it was too risky. Yes, it could have put her life at risk. Dr. Shahiba Naila's condition is out of danger now. For now, she's out of danger but her heart valves are still closed. The risk will always be there. What options do we have to open her heart valves? Open heart surgery is an option...but But at this moment, I won't advise doing that. so what should we do? Look, my advice right now is to not cause them any kind of stress. Keep them very happy. At this time, as a family, you need to keep this in mind. that their important valves is closed Any kind of stress can endanger their life. doctor can we meet Naila? Yes, absolutely, you can meet her.  I'll discharge her this evening anyway.

I am the real reason behind this heart attack. No Ahsan, why are you thinking like that? this is reality The doctor said if she experiences any stress, God forbid, she could lose her life ohh.. then? How could I be so selfish?
ohh.. then? How could I be so selfish? To sacrifice my mother's life for my own desires? yes you are right Selfishness was in me too The one who sacrificed their father's life for their own desires. i did not mean that You understood me perfectly. Your mother wants you to marry Farha, and you can't refuse her. look Mahi.. she is mother.. and me..she is you're mother and he was my father Then you tell me, what should I do? Whether you do something or not, But please don't give people false hope. I didn't give anyone false hope. I'm still standing by what I said earlier today. that i'll support you you support me? But on what basis and what relationship? you Will  marry Farah? and supports me..how it is possible? answer me Mahi cannot be more than one woman in a man's life.? Yes, it could be,...but..but what? But under what relationship? Different relationships can be based on love, affection, or necessity. And will you keep me in a relationship out of necessity? why are you thinking like that? Because your relationship of love is with Aroob. You want to establish a social relationship with farah So the only thing left is a relationship out of necessity. I'm not asking for any kind of relationship from you. That you are compelled to form any relationship with me. Is it necessary to label every relationship? The existence or non-existence of an anonymous relationship is meaningless. The basis on which any relationship stands firm. Can they not break in a single moment too? In simple terms, does it mean that you cannot marry me Please don't ask me for something I cannot give music lovely plan definatly..okay i will talk you later Aroob had a doctor's appointment today. why?..what happend with her?

In this condition, how many women in the world travel by rickshaw? If she does it, what difference will it make? Take her in a rickshaw. come.. come lets go music did you talk with Ahsan?..yes mamma he called.. what he is saying? nothing special He has no topic to talk about with me other than Aroob, Mom look darling everthing will be alright.. just give some time Will Ahsan be okay, or will my relationship with him ? both both will be fine just give time you are right.. give it some time. what you mean? Meaning that I feel like Ahsan Naila aunt 's  under pressure due to her health, he's getting married. and i can't digest it i feel like Ahsan is being forcibly tied to me in a relationship. you don't like Ahsan? i like him mom but He should also like me too.. It was difficult to convince Ahsan. And now you're doing all this? how can i convense Naila? you know she is well Mom, when did I refuse? I am actually agreeing with you. But I just feel we should give it some time. Yes, that's fine...but what should  i say to Naila? You tell her we will get engaged and marry later after some time. Okay, what will happen then? if we will adjust after become a fiance Then we will be able to carry forward the relationship towards marriage. The engagement period should be at least 6 months. time is the best  Now only time will tell if we can live together or  It's better to say goodbye for us.
