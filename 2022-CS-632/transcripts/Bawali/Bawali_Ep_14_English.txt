Son, those relationships which cannot bear the burden of truth, it is better to break them, but the soul will not be able to tolerate this, it would be an injustice to her, mother, they have come to take back the jewellery that they had given, where are the jewellery, bring it here, give me aunt also bring the baby inside, it is time for her fit, come quickly, yes, yes come [music], inform all those who were cut off from the wedding that the marriage has been cancelled, and what reason should I tell, that crazy daughter-in-law of our house has come back, right, come shut up, I told you, I feel that you have changed, you are right, maybe I have changed, earlier I was only your wife and love, and even now you are my wife and love, you know how much I love you, it is natural for you to get angry, but what will happen by doing all this, very good, you are spending your life peacefully by playing such a big joke with me, I should not say anything, but tomorrow is our marriage, tomorrow's marriage and day after tomorrow's marriage, now everything is over  But I am not able to understand anything right now, my mind is not working, Amma ya Allah, well what happened, tell me something, what happened? What happened? It was Eson's call, yes it was Eson's call, what happened? Tell me the whole story, what happened, Amma, what happened is it okay, Arup broke up with me? Ami, Arup has come back, she has also recovered and Roop has come back, so then there will be no Nikah now. [Music] Okay, okay, look, there must be some blessing from Allah in this also, and why are you crying, we have not made any loss-making deal, you have become the owner of the flat, right, Ami, in this whole matter, my father died, my marriage was stopped, you are telling me that I should be happy for a flat. [Music] What does father's death have to do with this whole matter, this girl has gone mad. [Music] So I don't know dad, when will everything be fine in my life, son, it is in the trials and mistakes of life that a person's character and understanding is revealed, and maybe this is also his test, I am tired, but now dad, if not today, then tomorrow  Roop will come to know that I was getting married to Fara and then the same thing will start, the same husband-wife fights, son, your marriage with Fara was just a compromise and I think Urub will definitely understand this, but who will explain it to her, who will tell her, who will explain all this, son, you will tell, you explain and son, remember one thing in life, these business relationships, tricks work in them, but these relationships of love, one should not be mocked at, but dad, sometimes too much truth and too much straightforwardness also become the reason for breaking of relationships, son, those relationships which cannot bear the burden of truth, it is better if they break, but if Roo will not be able to tolerate it, it will be an excess with her, tell me one thing, are you worried about Urup's tolerance or do you not have the courage to speak the truth, what are you thinking now, look son, do not think too much, if you think too much then tricks will come to the mind, when tricks are used then the relationship gets weakened, this is right, good  Let's leave this aside, tell me what to name Chote Miya, have you thought of anything? Tell me brother, Grandma has come, ask her, brother what should I name Hasan's son, whatever you people want, keep it. Asan, you just call the marriage hall people and refuse them, I had already done that to all the guests who had been distributed the wedding cards, you also call them and refuse them, why are you getting angry at me, the wedding is not cancelled because of me, but now you are feeling happy as if some of your heartfelt wishes have been fulfilled, my wish of having a daughter-in-law and grandson to come has been fulfilled, I am happy about that, yes, all your wishes are being fulfilled, my only luck is bad, I am leaving this house, yes, go son, go, till the time your mother will vent her anger on me again, she will not get any peace, you go [ Sangeet] It's not even been a day since Urup left but it seems as if the shine of our house has gone, Hama is right, she was with me for so long that without her, it feels like a home  Virar, she made space for herself and went away Son, you used to go to work, then she used to roam around me the whole day Amma, I want this, Amma, I want that, a very sweet, innocent girl, may Allah bless our fate, Amen Amma, what do you think, she will come to meet us, why won't she come? She has called me mother, I am her mother, she will definitely come, see from me Amma, don't have much expectation, she was a daughter of many rich people, she has gone away to her world, she will not come back now Amma, she had become Babli, so beware, whoever calls my daughter Babli, she was innocent yesterday as well as she is innocent today [Music] ok Nana [Music] does n't say anything to your daughter, my daughter is very intelligent and courageous, you will see, one day or the other, she will surprise everyone, those who call my daughter crazy, just see, one day or the other, they will all become crazy themselves, yes, ok Amma, if you are full of praising your daughter, then order something to eat, I am feeling hungry, yes, yes, I am doing it [Music] [Music] I am going to sleep, go to sleep, I am going to sleep, oh son, at this time in the night, go out of the room, is everything alright, right? Just Labhi  Ase was sleeping in the room, this gentleman started crying, I took him out, ok I was just asking, so was Aunty [Sangeet] ji, are you sure that Asein was marrying Fara? Yes son, why did I start talking nonsense, all the arrangements were gone, even the cards were printed, why do you have any doubts, I was just asking you, is this right, what is the matter, if Asein was marrying Fara, then how is it possible that Asein is talking to both Fara and Mahi at the same time, how can Aunty tolerate and how can Fara agree to his marriage to Mahi, what is going on [Sangeet] [Sangeet] come on son, brother, where is our little Miya, he is upstairs, playing with Labhi, ok ok ok son, do one thing, go to the market today, so that you can shop for some clothes for him, Nayla, you come along with him, it is possible that he might not know from where to get good clothes for children, yes, definitely Asein son, I am thinking that you should take leave from the office today, stay with him today, it's good [Sangeet] Rub  She has died at the house of one of my acquaintances, so I was going to pay my respects, I will be back in a little while, okay, you go and tell your acquaintances to have some patience because no one can stop the one who comes nor listen to the one who leaves, I was thinking that I should shift to Khala B's room for a few days, why would you shift to Labhi's quarter, she just cries at night, your sleep gets disturbed, so no, no, there is no such thing, my wife should stay in the servant quarter and I should stay in this room, this cannot happen, I don't remember, but maybe earlier also she was staying in Khala B's room and you are not alone here, you probably don't remember, you were here, in this very room, okay, when I came back, all my stuff was lying in Khala B's quarter, so I thought maybe it was actually my uncle, yes, Khala B told me, sorry, I forgot, she had taken my stuff away from here, yes, Khala B must have taken it away, but I didn't understand, if I was staying in this room, then why did I take all my stuff away  And why did she go there [Sangeet] And more importantly how did you let them take my stuff? Yeah, right? I shouldn't have let them do this. I should have stopped them. I don't know. Maybe I didn't notice this. Your attention must have been diverted to other matters. It's okay. Well, you go. They must be waiting for you. Listen, I can't find one more thing. I asked my aunt too. She said, maybe you gave it to your mother. Please take it back from her. Don't worry, I will get it back. So please take it back from her. Khuda Hafiz Allah Hafiz [Sangeet] [Sangeet] Mero [Sangeet] Bachcha, bas bas bas bas, tell Labhi Arup that we have to go to the mall. The daughter has gone, but where has she gone to the market? She was saying that she has to go shopping for the little one. Shopping for the little one. But she had to go with me. She was saying that aunty will take time to get ready. That's why I am going alone. She has gone with Asan. No, no, with the driver. Madam could not wait for me for a while. Well, I don't have any interest in going with him either. Why are you crying?  Does he want to drink milk or not? He has just drunk milk. Aunty also must have drunk milk. His diaper must have become wet. You should change it. The diapers were finished. Aru has gone to get it. She must be coming to get it. Till then will the child keep crying? Aunty should also take off his diaper and control him. But till then what should I feed him? Aunty should also wrap him in a sheet. He's a small child. What happened? [ Music] Baba, just now, just now. Uncle would have come. Uncle would have come. I'm laughing. [Music] Salam Walekum Walekum Assalam. Come on, what's the time? It must be almost 5 o'clock right now. Why are you laughing? Today at exactly 5 o'clock, your and my Nikah was but see, how strange it is. Are you also here? I'm also here. But neither is there a Qazi nor a witness. Just thinking this, I started laughing at my fate. [Music] Look mother, it's not my fault. How would I know that she would come back? When did I say that it was your fault? Can I ask you one thing? Yes, ask. Your and my Nikah had to be kept secret anyway. So, what difference does it make if Arup comes or not? What do you mean?  What are you saying? It means that even earlier you were going to hide your marriage with me from your would be wife Fara, then why can't you hide it from Roop? How can this happen? Why can't this happen? Anyway I am a spare wheel of your life's car which just stays in the trunk of the car. Now Arup has returned. I was not taking Arup's place even earlier. You were giving that place to Fara, so what difference does it make? I would have been your secret wife even earlier and even now. Look, my please don't talk like this to me at this time. I am already very confused. Do n't increase my confusion by saying such things. Actually, I had come here to take back the jewellery that I had given you. Because Arup is repeatedly asking about them. Please, those jewellery are not with me. Amma [Music] Amma Amma Alam waekum waekum assalam. When did you come son? I have just come to take back the jewellery that you had given me. Where is the spare wheel with me? What do you mean, son?  So I sold it and kept the money, if you ask I will bring it and give it to you I sold it, I mean the money [Music] Okay I'm leaving, okay son, keep coming now at least tell me how is Roop [Music] Okay that Khuda Hafiz Allah Hafiz Amma, when did you sell the jewellery, where did you keep the jewellery, then why did you lie to S and if he had asked for the money, then you would have said what happened by keeping it in the bank, you got the money but what did I get, there's no need to speak too many filmy dialogues, I wo n't take all this money with me to the grave, it will be useful for you only, let me talk to you [Music] Listen, did I tell you about the marriage with Esan [Music] no, aunt also, was Esan having an affair with Mahi as well, no, no, there's nothing like that, but why did you think of this, aunt also didn't think about it, it's the reality, your Munna Miya was going to marry Mai as well along with Fara, right daughter, how can this be true, but this is the truth, I'm just waiting for this thing, when would you tell me this truth [Music] look, Fara Jo  Whatever happened was not my fault but I still wanted to come myself and explain everything to you and apologize to you. If it was not your fault then why are you saying sorry? Do you know how much insulted Mom and I were among our acquaintances? I cannot tell you that that too was only because of Khala's stubbornness. But Mama did not know that A would come back immediately. Well, what's done is done. You told Roop that we were going to get married. No, so you could not tell me right now. Are you afraid that B will leave you? Yes, that is the fear, isn't it? It is possible that she will not do that. And if she leaves, then well, even if that happens, don't keep any expectations from me and Mom. Infact, I am planning to shift to London. Okay, but in future it will never happen that because of me you get into any difficult situation and get stuck in that situation. Really thank you very much and I am really very sorry. [Sangeet] Choti Miya is getting herself worked up. I thought I should take her for a massage to freshen up a bit.  She flushes it, yes I do, but when he starts crying, Aroob refuses, why would she refuse, massage is good for children, bring it here, give it to me, aunt also bring the baby inside, it's time for his feet, he's coming soon, he's coming [Music] [Music] How are you son, I'm fine, uncle, bring it, brother, give it to me, my love, come, Chotu Miya, come [Music] Go, Bhaiya, you know we are your grandfathers and you are our life, my baby, small son, did you get it vaccinated, uncle, I don't know when to get it vaccinated, yes, obviously how would you know, I tell Nala, here she's here, talk to Doctor Shaila and get him vaccinated, okay, I'll talk to her, what trouble do you need to take, aunty, I'll call her myself, son, what happened, what trouble are you having, grandma, bring it to me, please, no, it's time for his feet, I'll get it done and bring it in a little while [Music] Have you seen, you don't even let me touch my grandson, come,  The child must have been hungry that's why she took him away. This is not the first time when I try to pick up the child, he remembers his milk. I am his grandmother and I too feel like hugging his child to my chest. I am not a child. I understand everything. What is she doing? What is she doing to me? Is she taking revenge on me? What is she taking revenge for? What has happened when she does n't even remember how your and her relationship was? Then tell me what is the revenge for? Tell me, I am wrong in everything. Okay I am Rang Nala you [Music] [Music] [Music] Sir, do you want something? Yes, I want my old look back. She has been lost somewhere. Now I will have to live with you. Or else, or what? Or find a new look [Music] What kind of a man are you saying? I myself am telling you to find someone else and you are getting angry at that too. Please don't joke like this, friend. Joke. When I was not here, didn't you look for someone else in my place? And actually, I want to tell you something. I would also like to hear from you, actually when you were not here, I mean when you were missing, then why are you getting so nervous, what happened when I was not here, actually my uncle was very big, how would I spend my life alone, so he said that I should get married again, aunty suggested you to get married again [Music] so what did you say, I became very lonely after you left [Music] yaar, so I said yes [Music] right, how were you getting married, from Fara [Music], just from Fara [Music] to B [ Music]
