The idea of winning over Ahsan was yours Whatever happens now, you will be responsible. So, I told Ami clearly that we'll just get engaged for now Will you refuse this marriage in 6 to 7 months or will my misunderstanding be cleared? Oh hello madam, who are you? What are you doing here? Aroob What are you doing in my car? Whatever you are music As a family, you'll need to keep this in mind. That their important valve is closed. Any type of shock or trauma can be life-threatening for her Your happiness is my happiness It will happen as you say. Now happy, even your wish has been fulfilled. Please, just don't take this to heart now You're doing amazing acting We just have to do what's best for the children. Is it necessary to name every relationship? An unnamed relationship. Whether it exists or not is meaningless You can tell them we'll get engaged for now and marry later. What will happen? This will happen if we adjust after becoming engaged Only then we can proceed to establish the relationship of marriage. May Allah bless Ahsan Otherwise, it becomes difficult for running house after your father What happened? Am I saying something wrong? You're not saying anything wrong, mom But do keep in mind that why he is doing this good. I understand everything; I'm not a child. And I also know that you're the reason for his kindness. Still, you have no objection to this? What's wrong with that? Ahsan is a good person and he likes you. He will marry you, He's not marrying me. He's marrying his cousin Farha...what?..yes Who told you all this? Ahsan himself told me. If he is marrying someone else what does that have to do with our family? Let me talk to him myself today. Did he say it as a joke? What else will you say to him? i will say him if he is marrying someone else so don't come here.. Then have you thought about who will support us after that? Something will happen..Don't let your heart be small. I'm alive and well, no need to worry. Mom, your words won't even bring a loaf of bread But how can you maintain a relationship with him like this? The idea of winning over Ahsan was yours Whatever happens now, you will be responsible. Remember this. I was wishing for your well-being. How would I know he would do all this? What does he think?we are honorable and decent people. Mom, a decent girl doesn't cast doubt on her brother in law And no respectable mother encourages her daughter to do this okay now leave this matter Don't lecture me unnecessarily. instead,find a solution to this issue. Mom, you are a widow, and I am just an ordinary girl. And we have no other support besides Ahsan right now If Ahsan doesn't happen, we'll end up on the streets. So let things continue as they are Mahi listen to me.. music Oh, oh, oh! What are you doing, dear? khala bi..what..slowly slowly what are you doing khala bii? No one lets me go to school.

Now it's this girl who just doesn't understand girl?..who?..farah? why what she is saying? Farah is saying that she will take 4 to 6 months to initiate the engagement. She wants to understand and is asking for some time that Are they both comfortable with the marriage? But in 6 months, how will they know each other well enough? I don't know, this girl has gone crazy. Then why don't you talk to Nazia so she can explain it to her? Poor thing, you know kids these days listen to their parents Naila Begum, things aren't like that anymore. "Did Ahsan listen to you? Never mind, I had a heart attack, otherwise your son was also saying noo Yes, for now, what should be done next? look Naveed I don't think this issue will be resolved until Aroob is here. Naila, where did Aroob come from all this conversation? Do you know what Farah's real issue is? That Aroob lives here, she will never come here as a bride. As long as she's here Why are you talking strangely? First you said she should shift to Auntie's room I've accepted your point. Now you're talking about kicking her out of the house? You're crossing the line, man. Naveed, please try to..no no never This can not happen..understand? Oh God, what should I do about these father and son? greetings.. son I have something to tell you. Yes, go ahead. Son, take your wife out for outings and excursions. I don't let her play. she get bored staying in the same place all the time. They also take little kids to play.

Yes, but that's a servant's room. anyways..Shift her belongings there. as you wish It doesn't seem appropriate. daughter-in-law of the house is staying in the servants' room What should we do?if this crazy woman stays in Ahsan's room Will Farah live in the servants' room pretending to be a daughter-in-law? The house is so big, isn't there another room? Now, will you make the decisions regarding this house? Do as you have been told I have raised Ahsan I will also raise Aroob and her children. And I get paid for this work you are the owner of this house Put whoever you want to keep or remove. But I won't get involved in this work. khala bii? Its wings have been clipped. door knocking hi Ahsan What did you buy? no its nothing its groceries No, these groceries are not for me. They needed it, so I gave it to them..

Yes, I'm not too busy right now...we can go okay let's go And yes Ahsan, I have talked to mom I've told her that I'm not ready for marriage yet. but why? Because you're not yet fully ready for marriage. When did I say that? you didn't say it aloud, but I feel this way. That's why I clearly told mom that we should just get engaged for now. Within 6 to 7 months, either you'll refuse this marriage or my misunderstanding will be cleared. That you're not ready for this relationship wholeheartedly And during this time, you'll also make decision regarding Aroob. What kind of decision? Obviously you know Aroob and I,can't live together in the same house Farah is she child..yes mentally child not physically you sit in the car i follow you.. music this crazy has turned the room into a mess. No, it's become a madhouse When will I be rid of this nuisance? Now, what does she need all these things for? In her fate, playing with toys seems to be a lifelong affair. khala bii?..khala bii?.. yes Ma'am? Take all her belongings and shift them to your room. but Ma'am..I said that from now on, I don't want to see any of her belongings here. okay ma'am aunt?..come here..what is? come here and see.. yes tell?

No dear, everything is fine. Stay blessed. okay sit here i neeed to talk with you sit yes? Look, dear, you're a sensible boy and Mahi is sensible too. But she's just a bit emotional, you understand, right? yes i understand...I was just saying, in any situation, one shouldn't be emotional. Especially when relationships are being formed or broken. yes you are right..Son, I have seen the world. And in a moment, I've seen the East become West and the West become East. Now see, Mahi's father isn't around anymore. So obviously, I have to talk to you about this. okay tell me..you like Mahi? yes so there's no issue..See, a man is allowed to have four marriages. Even if you also have three, there won't be any problem yes but...The issue is with Mama. without her permission..Son, I'm not a child to create a fuss about yours and Mahi's wedding. Look, where there is trust in relationships, there should also be boundaries maintained. don't worry about this yes but i need time to think about this Oh dear, why even think about that? Look, this way our respect and dignity will also remain intact. And you won't have any problem either. music come dear.. mama? You moved Aroob's belongings from my room downstairs? Yes, I had them moved, but why? We had decided, right? that Aroob wouldn't leave my room until another girl enters my life Look, Ahsan, today or tomorrow, Aroob had to shift downstairs, right? I just thought I'd move her downstairs today. look you are sensible It's better for Aroob to stay downstairs between these days She has trouble going upstairs, Besides, Aunt can't always stop her either, right? its better for her to stay downstairs..but mama this is wrong what's wrong in? It doesn't matter whether she stays downstairs or upstairs That's what I'm saying, why is it necessary for Aroob to shift downstairs? its necessary she's going to be your future wife. She will never tolerate That another girl sharing you're room How are you forgetting that Aroob is not just any girl she is my wife And she is the mother of my future child. I'm not forgetting anything, but you might be forgetting something. Aroob is only your legal wife on paper Your real wife is coming soon. music he is child. When will he understand? i can't believe music khala bii? khala bi? yes? Ahsan's voice was coming; where did he go now?
