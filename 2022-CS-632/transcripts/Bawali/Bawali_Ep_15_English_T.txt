[0.52] Will you ever be able to forgive me
[3.16] [Sangeet]
[7.00] Maybe I will forgive you
[10.28] If you tell me the complete truth I was
[14.28] thinking of naming him Bawla Arup
[19.28] God forbid why are you joking
[23.68] When he was growing in my womb
[28.24] everyone had named me Bawli too
[30.92] And sometimes I used to sleep near Khadim
[34.88] and you know Khadim gives a very good massage
[42.73] [Sangeet]
[52.84] They came to take back the jewellery they had given me
[55.60] I sold it and kept the money If you
[59.60] ask I will bring it and give it to you I sold it I mean what is the use of
[62.96] money Why does she
[67.64] refuse Massage is good for
[69.96] children Yes bring it
[72.04] here give it to me Aunty
[76.12] also bring the baby inside It is time for his feeding
[79.76] Nabat This is not the first time when I
[83.00] try to pick up the child he
[85.00] remembers his milk I am his grandmother
[89.08] I also feel like holding his child to my
[90.92] chest Mama was very big
[94.00] how would I spend my life alone He
[103.00] said that
[106.20] I should get married again
[109.68] You were marrying whom Fara
[114.52] [Sangeet]
[123.40] What do you mean by just Fara? I
[128.60] mean you loved me a lot Nasan, a
[134.52] lot. After I left like this, a
[139.72] huge space must have been created in your life,
[144.28] right?
[146.56] So you must have thought that
[150.64] Fara alone will not be able to fill such a big space
[156.88] and that is why it would be better if you have two wives and not one.
[163.76] Aru. What are you saying?
[167.48] Well, tell me, if you
[170.80] go somewhere, will the
[175.24] option of a second marriage be good for me too?
[176.60] I will never leave you and go anywhere.
[181.04] You had told me earlier also
[184.76] that I will never leave you and go anywhere.
[187.90] [Sangeet] That's
[192.00] all I wanted to tell you. There's nothing
[194.80] else. There's nothing else to
[199.16] tell you. Are
[203.80] you sorry? Yes, I am absolutely sure Arup.
[222.60] Arup. Will you ever be able to forgive me?
[226.36] [Sangeet]
[230.08] Maybe I will forgive you.
[233.48] If you tell me the complete truth, then the
[240.16] complete
[243.88] truth, half truth, gives more pain than complete forgiveness. Half truth,
[267.28] ok, you must have Mahi's number.
[271.72] Yes, what
[277.16] Mahi, I think,
[279.56] so let me
[290.32] check. How are you? Mahi? You guys have not heard of me.  You did

[371.00] you pretending without any reason ami I feel
[373.88] that Arup has got suspicious there is a
[375.60] tanka in the thief's beard why are you
[379.44] harbouring an illusion without any reason there is nothing for sure is
[381.76] n't it it's just my illusion yes yes it's for sure

[489.68] not even a little,
[494.56] ok,

[561.48] what you want to ask me,

[569.12] Esan take care of me or not, did he
[572.96] love me or not, have you
[577.92] evolved into some other girl,
[582.17] [Music]
[585.20] Look Arup, I don't know anything about everything, yes
[589.64] I did come here for a few days to take
[591.16] care of you but then because of aunty's attitude
[594.04] I did not come back here, why did aunty's
[597.76] attitude,
[600.24] why did she spoil her attitude, she did
[602.84] not like my coming here
[608.16] and was giving some other color to my coming here,
[611.72] other
[616.08] color
[617.76] means she was not understanding that you and
[621.80] Esan, hey aunty has also crossed all limits, how can a girl have an
[626.48] affair with her brother-in-law,
[630.52] but why are we talking about all this at
[632.16] this time

[707.72] ashamed to bring this up she has always seen you as brothers she should
[715.20] apologize to Mahi aunty
[722.84] you think if Mahi was your real sister you would have
[730.28] felt so bad and you also consider Mahi as your sister

[788.48] insulted you He made me
[790.96] realise how cheap a girl I am I feel like committing
[793.64] suicide no no
[796.00] God forbid you do not say such things
[802.00] What does this Roof's daughter think of herself I brought her
[804.56] up for this day that she can trouble my daughter ungrateful Come
[809.68] with me right now I will teach him a lesson
[811.80] no Amma I am not sad about Arup's

[817.28] fact that Esan kept listening to everything like a fool there ok

[858.68] baby what happened what happened what happened how come how
[879.83] [Music]
[882.24] how are you I am
[884.92] fine what did you both think of the younger one's name were you
[890.88] thinking his name  Should I call him Bawla,
[896.12] Arup, God forbid, why are you joking, when
[901.48] this person was growing in my womb,
[905.20] everyone had named me Bawli, so
[908.24] Bawli's son,
[911.44] Bawli, Bawli,
[913.32] who told you this about your name? No
[919.48] one told me,
[921.72] but Bawli will be called Bawli only, right?
[925.12] Syani will not say so
[927.70] [Music]
[931.16] Arup, do you have any complaint against me? Do
[937.56] you feel bad about something I said?
[940.88] Why do you complain against me? What did you do to me?
[945.04] I was asking anyway, maybe
[950.08] if you are referring to Esan's second marriage, then
[953.72] no, yes, it is possible that you have a
[957.28] complaint against
[959.32] me because I wanted to get Fara married to him for the second time.
[961.96] If my husband is going to marry for the second time, then
[966.72] my complaint will be with my husband,
[971.04] not with my mother-in-law. See, Arup, at that time, the situation was
[975.20] totally different, you were lost, we did
[978.00] not know where you were, your mental
[980.28] condition had also gone mad, Aru, the
[983.88] condition you were in, if any
[987.56] mother thinks of her daughter's second marriage, then
[990.24] what is wrong in it? A mother should only think about her son, the
[993.48] girl who is your daughter-in-law.  she is
[998.08] also someone's daughter we should
[1001.40] n't think about her if it were your real
[1004.88] daughter in my place you would have taken the same decision
[1011.11] [Music]
[1016.76] What Arup
[1019.60] you are also like my daughter
[1023.24] my mother died in my childhood
[1028.64] you are my mother in law, just mother in law

[1286.93] [Music]
[1294.56] Son, ever since you left that house, the
[1297.96] charm of that house has gone away. Amma, I miss you both
[1302.36] a lot. I
[1305.04] remember both of you every day.
[1310.36] Khadim, you and I, what are you doing? Sir, Alam
[1314.84] Waleek, Sir, Lek Salam Khadim, sit down. Asan, this is the person
[1319.48] in whose house I have stayed for so many
[1323.12] days. And this is his mother.
[1327.00] Khadim, you never told me, but I,
[1331.96] oh, how would Khadim know that I am your
[1333.84] wife? When he came here, he told me
[1336.52] that he works with you and this
[1339.40] mother is Khadim's and mine too. Stay happy,
[1343.76] son, always be safe.
[1349.28] When I was alone and helpless in the whole world,
[1352.28] they supported me. When even my own people had left me,
[1358.24] then they adopted me.
[1362.92] I am a diabetic. You people, especially
[1366.68] Khadim, Khadim took great care of me.
[1372.96] Really, Khadim took so much care of me.
[1377.08] Amma used to go to sleep the whole time and I used to go to sleep for half the time.  I used to
[1380.28] sit near the Khadim and keep bothering his head till midnight
[1382.72] and the poor guy would never say anything
[1386.96] and sometimes I would even sleep near the Khadim
[1393.84] and you know, Khadim gives a very good massage,
[1400.16] excuse me, he gives a very good head massage,
[1404.88] he gives such a good massage that it feels like there is a
[1407.56] professional Champi person
[1409.88] and we enjoyed so much, sometimes we used to go to
[1413.60] eat gol gappas, we also went to
[1416.16] watch movies, we used to have a lot of fun, we used to go
[1419.64] somewhere or the other everyday, we even went out to eat ice cream,
[1421.84] once you sit, I have an important meeting with him, I will leave,
[1425.84] ok bye
[1430.24] honey, see you
[1432.84] soon, what kind of things were you talking about in
[1435.44] front of him, when did I ask you, yes,
[1438.64] son, when did I leave you with the Khadim at midnight, what are
[1441.44] you talking about
[1446.67] [music]
[1463.00] hello, command sahab, you are in the office, right? Let's
[1468.80] do one thing, the boy who has been hired, who
[1471.40] works at our farm,
[1473.52] Khadim, clear all his accounts today,
[1476.24] pay off all the Tuesdays that are there, from tomorrow
[1478.80] he should not be seen in the office or on the farm,
[1481.92] thank you
[1485.26] [Music]
[1500.32] Yes Mahi, how are you I am coming to meet you,
[1504.24] why are you coming and I will tell you everything after coming
[1511.79] [Music]
[1519.32] Sir, I was lying to both of you, a
[1526.36] lie,
[1528.96] but why, look
[1531.08] Amma, you and I know that nothing like this happened,
[1533.96] if all this had happened in reality, I was at the
[1538.16] place where I was mentally, the
[1541.84] responsibility of all this would not have fallen on me, but
[1547.20] Esan Esan cheated on me while being in his senses,
[1550.60] yes, that's fine,
[1554.08] but think
[1556.52] how wrongly Kishan sahab must be thinking about me, let him think,
[1560.84] what happens if he thinks, is the
[1563.44] contract of infidelity taken up only by the man, ca
[1566.64] n't a woman even do the drama of infidelity, oh
[1569.16] son, where are you dragging us poor people in the matter of husband and wife,
[1572.40] Amma ji,
[1576.56] Amma son, relax, you
[1580.76] two are the only ones for me in the whole world, you both should
[1584.32] not worry about anything,
[1590.74] [Music]
[1609.80] what happened, why did you stop,
[1611.52] why did you come here,
[1620.72] please sit and talk,
[1625.28] no, please friend, I am very upset,
[1629.12] I know because  You would come here only when you were upset, so it
[1634.64] means you are calling me a jerk.
[1638.40] You are trying to say that I am selfish. It's
[1641.96] not you who is selfish, I am also selfish. We
[1646.76] both are selfish.
[1650.32] You needed the support of love to fill the empty space in your life
[1656.20] and
[1659.76] I need a rich man who
[1663.44] can support me. Why are you talking so much about it? Is there no
[1668.48] relationship of love between us?
[1678.28] Mr. Easan
[1680.24] sahab, did you not remember this relationship when
[1684.52] Aroob called our relationship as brother and sister?
[1687.72] Why were you silent then?
[1691.12] Where was your love then?
[1692.48] You didn't
[1696.88] say anything and now you are claiming to have a relationship of love with me.
[1699.96] Mahi, what could I
[1702.16] say?
[1704.08] I was helpless at that time, friend. Please try to understand. Why? Why do
[1709.36] you always ask me to understand?
[1711.44] Why don't you understand that I am also a
[1714.72] girl. I also have some desires. I want a
[1717.64] companionship. I am not some prostitute with whom you
[1721.84] made a relationship whenever you wanted and broke it whenever you wanted. Don't
[1724.64] forget that it is because of you,
[1729.28] Abbu is no longer in this world.  You went away
[1734.16] brother, you are right, I understood
[1738.64] and I decided to take the right decision, the
[1741.60] right decision is to
[1746.88] marry you,
[1754.64] if now your wife has come back,
[1758.28] my wife has come back but
[1762.16] my Arup has not come back,
[1768.48] but how will this happen,
[1771.76] it will happen the same way as it was happening before,
[1775.68] we will call four witnesses and do Nikah and you will
[1779.00] become my wife,
[1782.56] no this is not enough, it is
[1786.12] not enough
[1788.48] brother, I am marrying you, what else do you want, this is what I wanted
[1792.52] earlier
[1794.92] but now I want more, you want more,
[1799.88] what more do you want
[1802.72] now, if you want to marry me then
[1805.32] do it in a normal way, bring your parents to
[1807.88] my house, talk to my mother,
[1810.64] my wedding cards should be distributed,
[1812.80] everything should happen in a normal way,
[1815.32] now I am not ready for marriage,
[1819.92] what nonsense are you talking about, how can all this happen,
[1824.20] I have not come to your house with a request for marriage,
[1827.08] you came to my house, so keep your
[1830.60] voice low
[1835.00] and if you find my talks useless and
[1838.40] impossible, then hire
[1839.92] someone else for this secret marriage of yours
[1843.20] Find one,
[1845.80] or else live with your wife
[1850.86] [Music]
[1861.91] [Music]
[1865.00] Where are you Mahi
[1870.55] [Music]
[1872.32] Mother,
[1876.28] what happened, crazy girl, why are you crying?
[1881.08] Whatever you demanded was absolutely right,
[1884.00] I have heard it, I
[1888.52] know everything, Amma, he will never
[1892.76] agree to that demand, even if you agree to his demand, I am
[1896.56] not going to hand over my elder daughter to that mad man.
[1899.24] Look, he went mad, first he
[1902.92] roamed around like a fool in love with Urup, then
[1905.52] on his mother's insistence, he agreed to tie the knot with Fara,
[1907.60] and now he is ready to marry you secretly. He went
[1911.60] mad, didn't he? You made
[1918.68] him a lifelong patient, so
[1922.40] look at this man's actions, now that he has found his wife, he has
[1925.56] come to you like a filmy hero
[1928.64] [Music] I will
[1931.48] bring something to eat for you.
[1936.32] Your father loved you a lot. There is a
[1944.40] fixed time for everyone to leave, do
[1950.04] n't burden yourself with that.
[1953.27] [Music]
