[199.38] he shouldn't do anything drastic in this mental state
[202.58] It would be wrong for him. isn'it?
[205.46] look..Ahsan is experiencing a mental condition right now

[389.28] Is there a baby in my tummy? yess
[391.72] My Aroob's baby
[395.34] If there's a baby in my tummy, why isn't it playing with me?
[400.40] he will come out and play with you too."
[404.50] but he is too small now
[407.56] Oh, a little baby? So tiny?
[411.56] yes so tiny..
[414.38] So that's why you have to take extra care of it
[418.10] Whether awake or asleep, whether changing sides 
[424.64] you have to eat alot..okay khala bii
[428.64] i will take care of him alot
[432.02] You will be so happy to see it.
[434.02] good..good
[436.02] How did the baby come into my tummy?
[442.24] The fairy came and left it here.
[448.34] The fairy came here?
[450.34] yes So fairies leave babies in everyone's stomach?
[455.30] Did the fairy also place a baby in your tummy?
[457.66] Then will the two babies be friends? 
[460.32]  Will they play together?
[462.32] bad baby
[467.66] The innocent you become very mischievous.
[471.56] yeah...i told you don't do this
[474.76] khala bii but baby...
[478.22] I knew you would come back.
[485.48] How did you
[488.74] I forgot that you know everything beforehand.
[492.98] You'll keep arguing with me as long as you keep arguing with yourself.
[499.90] Why don't you accept? that you are a human
[503.22] And humans can be very fragile.
[505.76] I don't know why I came back here again.
[511.12] I'm leaving now...sit down.
[514.82] You're tired
[516.16] from fighting with yourself and running away from yourself.
[519.76] take rest and sit here
[524.28] Look, whatever you've lost.
[530.56] Search for what you've lost inside yourself.
[535.76] Because you'll find it within yourself, not outside.
[542.18] inside?
[544.22] yes I know that understanding oneself is not an easy task.
[550.88] So what should be done for that?
[554.94] Look, this glass of water is full.
[560.04] If you add more water to it, it will overflow, right?
[564.08] right
[566.24] You are filled up like water, in that way.
[571.04] So empty yourself to find the path inward.
[576.48] but how?
[582.08] Stop fighting within yourself.
[585.32] which fight?
[587.32] How conflict? There's no conflict going on inside me
[592.14] I'm not understanding which conflict you're referring to.
[597.74] The struggle between your physical desires and your emotions.
[602.64] Okay, forget that. Tell me, what is troubling you?
[611.52] Simply ,my issue is that
[618.80] i loved Aroob
[624.46] But along with that, I've started liking another girl.
[631.22] but
[633.10] My mom doesn't approve of my choice for me.
[637.56] See, it was such a simple matter that you couldn't say it.
[642.48] Now that you've said this thing
[644.48] surely you'll find some solution for it
[647.42] You think this issue seems small.
[648.90] Oh my dear, no issue is small or big.
[652.74] We make it big or small ourselves.
[655.34] Alright, for today, that's enough. You go now.
[661.66] Today, you've accomplished a lot.
[665.20] Which accomplishment? To tell me the truth
[668.92] Today, you've honestly told yourself what your situation is.
[674.20] and you will find solution too
[679.48] music

[839.60] Aunty has had a heart attack...what?
[841.20] Mom called, we need to hurry to the hospital.
[844.18] music
[857.82] Dad..Dad how's mama?
[862.34] what happend? how's mama?
[866.44] She's in the OT
[868.44] Pray for her... everthing will be alright
[874.28] When and how did this happen?
[879.04] I was having coffee with Naila at the café.
[882.02] Suddenly, she felt chest pain, so I brought her here immediately.
[887.46] For several days, she had been complaining of pain in her left arm.
[893.62] But she didn't mention anything to me about it.
[899.90] She had been very stressed for quite a few days.
[902.48] she was saying that their distress has become unbearable for me.
[907.70] which problem?
[909.70] What kind of problems could a mother have with her children?
[914.90] It seems like she was stressed because of you.
[922.16] Ahsan?...Ahsan what happend? everthing will be fine
[937.04] If something happens to mom, I'll never forgive myself.
[943.40] nothing will happen to her, or it's all my fault.
[947.84] Nothing can happen to my mom.
[951.44] ahsan what happend?
[953.54]  Keep your chin up, everything will be alright.
[957.66] Dad.... Doctor come
[960.82] Dr. How is Naila now?
[964.68] Look Nazia, your sister's heart valves were both closed.
[969.72] I opened one with a stent.
[973.84] But they didn't do anything for the other one 
[976.56]  because it was too risky.
[978.56] Yes, it could have put her life at risk.
[982.34] Dr. Shahiba Naila's condition is out of danger now.
[987.78] For now, she's out of danger
[990.32] but her heart valves are still closed.
[992.80] The risk will always be there.
[996.60] What options do we have to open her heart valves?
[1000.12] Open heart surgery is an option...but
[1002.60] But at this moment, I won't advise doing that.
[1005.14] so what should we do?
[1010.02] Look, my advice right now is to not cause them any kind of stress.
[1015.04] Keep them very happy.
[1017.36] At this time, as a family, you need to keep this in mind.
[1020.56] that their important valves is closed
[1022.44] Any kind of stress can endanger their life.
[1027.64] doctor can we meet Naila?
[1031.16] Yes, absolutely, you can meet her. 
[1032.50] I'll discharge her this evening anyway.
[1034.90] You can take her home... okay Thankyou so much
[1037.98] come son...i love you mamma
[1041.32] i love you too son
[1045.94] Mom, you've been in pain for so many days, why didn't you tell me?
[1050.24] You should have mentioned it to me 
[1053.34] You were in distress yourself.
[1057.94] How could I trouble you at that time?
[1062.74] you are doing great
[1064.32] My concerns are not more important than your health.
[1067.70] For me, it's most important that you get better, that's all.
[1076.26] Ahsan, if you stay happy, then my health will automatically improve.
[1085.28] My happiness lies with you, Mom.
[1089.20] ohh.. we stay happy just listening to your scolding.
[1092.88] what you want else?
[1094.88] Where do you father and son listening to me?
[1100.82] What are you talking about?
[1103.16] What kind of thing are we not listening to?
[1106.70] music
[1113.76] You both know what makes me happy very well.
[1120.86] music
[1132.84] mamma?..Your happiness is my happiness.
[1138.94] And whatever you say will be.
[1142.78] okay? now happy?
[1146.76] Now even your wish has been fulfilled.
[1149.84] Please don't take such things to heart anymore.

[1295.40] I used to act in lead roles; don't you remember?
[1298.68] Yeah, I forgot... What can we do, buddy?
[1303.40] We have to do everything for the betterment of the children.
[1306.66] By the way, your acting wasn't bad either.
[1308.46] Actually, Dr. Ayesha should get the real award. isn'it?
By the way, your acting wasn't bad either.
[1308.48] Actually, Dr. Ayesha should get the real award. isn'it?
[1311.38] Yes, she was saying I act despite being a doctor
[1316.24] Okay, listen, Farah didn't suspect anything?
[1321.00] No, no, Farah didn't suspect anything.
[1323.28] In fact, she's very worried about her aunt
[1325.96] Okay, now don't delay
[1327.96] Prepare for the wedding quickly.
[1329.60] Make sure the father and son's minds don't change again
[1332.72] And I hope I don't actually have a heart attack.
[1335.26] God forbid.
[1338.58] its enoyable..isn'it?
[1345.34] where is aunty?
[1355.54] She had a lot of headache,
[1357.96] so she took medicine and went to sleep.
[1360.36] what happend Ahsan tell me?
[1368.48] mamma had heart attack.. what?
[1374.86] May Allah protect her. How is she now?
[1377.48] she is better..Now she is at home
[1383.32] Thank God
[1385.32] But how did all this happen suddenly?
[1389.16] Not suddenly, she had been stressed because of me for a long time.
[1396.24] She had a heart attack.
[1401.90] I am the real reason behind this heart attack.
[1405.58] No Ahsan, why are you thinking like that?
[1408.06] this is reality
[1411.54] The doctor said if she experiences any stress, God forbid, she could lose her life
[1419.76] ohh.. then?
[1427.00] How could I be so selfish?
ohh.. then?
[1427.02] How could I be so selfish?
[1431.04] To sacrifice my mother's life for my own desires?
[1434.94] yes you are right
[1437.96] Selfishness was in me too
[1439.96] The one who sacrificed their father's life for their own desires.
[1443.70] i did not mean that
[1446.00] You understood me perfectly.
[1448.00] Your mother wants you to marry Farha, and you can't refuse her.
[1454.80] look Mahi..
[1456.80] she is mother..
[1458.84] and me..she is you're mother and he was my father
[1463.18] Then you tell me, what should I do?
[1472.40] Whether you do something or not,
[1475.06] But please don't give people false hope.
[1479.68] I didn't give anyone false hope.
[1481.68] I'm still standing by what I said earlier today.
[1485.56] that i'll support you
[1487.52] you support me?
[1489.52] But on what basis and what relationship?
[1493.30] you Will  marry Farah?
[1500.84] and supports me..how it is possible?
[1503.26] answer me
[1513.16] Mahi cannot be more than one woman in a man's life.?
[1517.74] Yes, it could be,...but..but what?
[1523.54] But under what relationship?
[1525.46] Different relationships can be based on love, affection, or necessity.
[1536.94] And will you keep me in a relationship out of necessity?
[1542.46] why are you thinking like that?
[1544.24] Because your relationship of love is with Aroob.
[1548.60] You want to establish a social relationship with farah
[1551.86] So the only thing left is a relationship out of necessity.
[1556.56] I'm not asking for any kind of relationship from you.
[1558.56] That you are compelled to form any relationship with me.
[1562.44] Is it necessary to label every relationship?
[1567.74] The existence or non-existence of an anonymous relationship is meaningless.
[1573.96] The basis on which any relationship stands firm.
[1579.58] Can they not break in a single moment too?
[1584.84] In simple terms, does it mean
[1588.54] that you cannot marry me
[1591.36] Please don't ask me for something I cannot give
[1597.96] music
[1621.20] lovely plan
[1623.20] definatly..okay i will talk you later
[1629.60] Aroob had a doctor's appointment today.
