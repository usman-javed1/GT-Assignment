Now, whatever needs to be done, it's all in your hands. mom..can i told you something? that Ahsan isn't interested in me. Why is that? He didn't take you out for ice cream so you're saying this. No, Mom, it's not about the ice cream. you know He was sitting in the lawn for hours with his cousin and so-called best friend look Mahi Just as you used to see Ahsan as a brother because of Aroob. It's possible that Ahsan may not be seeing you like that  Mom, now there's no solution to this issue. If you don't have an answer to this, does your aunt  have one? So, what do you want? Tell them clearly. Please show some interest in me.
Tell them clearly. Please show some interest in me. I want to marry you. Yes, say it like this. What do they say in English? body language yes body language Now look, tell me something  Who is that girl? that have to rely on words to talk to. your eyes will speak those words.

Someone who doesn't treat Aroob like a rival but like a siste Naveed, you always do amazing things. okay.. but why? you are not woman you can't understand this  do one thing You're a woman, you should explain it. please understand what i mean No woman can share her love with another women Even if that other woman is her sister. This is an inappropriate matter. No two sisters can marry the same man. Your hint isn't towards Mahi, is it? understand please she is not her blood sister please stop it Now, how can I make a girl like her my daughter-in-law? Why are you getting angry? Think about the matter calmly. enough is enough I have tolerated a lot of misbehavior from both father and son. First son insisted and brought Aroob into my life. And now father insists on bringing his sister are you in your senses? where did my wish? Don't think of me as foolish. Naveed..Don't think of me as foolish.

I mean, who are you going with? with bad uncle aunt we  are going with Ahsan  ohh..Ahsan Aroob made Ahsan feel like a child and turned him into an uncle." and you you've removed "brother" from Ahsan's name and just made it Ahsan. no aunt actually girl listen to me carefully  one girl has trapped my son And another one is setting a trap. I won't let that happen. What are you saying, aunt? Okay, let's go, we're running late. music non sense Why is it so quiet? Mahi, why are you crying? Did the witch aunt bite her? Mom bit her?

Mom really embarrassed her whom Mahi? yes and then i apologized her You Tell me, what did you decide? I really don’t know I’m still confused Look, your mom wants you to get married again so she can be with Farha. Otherwise, she said clearly that  she will leave the house. what are mama is saying? Doesn't she know that if I marry Farha she will never let Aroob stay in this house I know, son Tell me, what do you want? I don't know, Dad. Sometimes life becomes such a situation that a person's own desires  and wishes become meaningless. But I still wish that Aroob gets completely well. I know, son. But son, my question was about Mahi and Farha. What do you suggest? Look, son, your mom accepted Aroob out of necessity because she loved you. But you want to accept Mahi because she is your beloved's younger sister. Son, I don't think it's possible. Man, Dad, you're amazing First, you're arguing in favor of Mahi, and now you're arguing against her. You're confused yourself. yes buddy  it really does seem like I'm confused It seems like i've come under your mother's pressure.  I really don’t know what to do okay don't worry everything will be alright music She's a very clever woman "In my heart, go and hit her i silenced  with Ahsan's words. he wants you to come daily why are you laughing You totally remind me of a mother from Pakistani dramas "Who always teaches her daughter how to trap rich boys.

i had checked by many doctors if no solid solution comes out what will this amil baba do? Son, sometimes doctors can't diagnose certain diseases. They recover with just one prayer. I've heard about a certain Baba... That's why I've come with interest  Take Aroob to them once too. uncle do one thing bring them here to our house?" Because I don't want to take Aroob there. okay i will try to bring him here  bye
