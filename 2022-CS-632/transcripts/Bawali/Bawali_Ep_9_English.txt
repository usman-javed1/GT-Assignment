And we have no other support besides Ahsan right now If Ahsan is not here, then we'll end up on the streets.  And during this time, you'll also make decision regarding Aroob What kind of a decision?  Obviously you know Aroob and I can't live together in the same house do you like Mahi? yes its not a problem then See, a man is allowed to have four marriages Even if you also have three, there won't be any problem  Did your son marry an underage girl?
its a crime.. How should we explain it to you?  Oh brother, we're not that foolish to not understand  who is she, dear? Mom, she didn't know her home address She was standing alone, so I thought I should bring her home  I am a very bad person I am a very careless person... because of my carelessness Aroob had an accident she lost her memory and now... now I have lost Aroob its such a big city, don't know in what condition my child must be where she must be? everyone is a vulture here And my child... my child doesn't have any sense aunty, please forgive me I've lost Aroob please forgive me No dear, don't cry stay strong may God keep my child in his protection Ok dear... It's time for me to offer prayers, so I am going dear what is your name?

The fairy came from the sky & she kept a baby in my womb fairy? who is a fairy? Mom, "pari" is called "fairy" in English I see, but dear how can a fairy leave a baby in her womb? Oh Mom, they tell such things to kids in the city. Okay But where did she come from? mom, how would I know? I am worried myself, I don't understand what is this issue yes dear even we are strangers in this city, what if we get into some hot water so what else shall we do mom, tell me do one thing File a report with the police yes Okay fine, but its night time now I will go to the police station earliest in the morning to file a report absolutely correct don't you worry if God wills we'll find Aroob how can I not worry? its my mistake I wish I hadn't attended your call that day at the mall, then I wouldn't have missed catching a glimpse of Aroob and... you are making me feel guilty along with yourself I wish, I wouldn't have called you at my house after calling you My father wouldn't have seen us, and he wouldn't have died I wish I hadn't called you in the mall; then Aroob wouldn't have gotten lost I wish I didn't have any feelings for you in my heart Mahi I swear, I didn't mean to blame you I am really sorry God is great, he will help us for sure yes, tell me what's the problem? Sir, I found a girl standing alone on the road at night time so? So, sir I want to file her missing report so what's the matter of filing a report in this? Sir, she has forgotten her house address Okay, then say it like this: You found a small girl. What is her age? Sir, I think she must be of 24 to 25 years old Why are you joking? Can a 24 to 25-year-old girl forget her house address? Sir... you are right but.. get up from here & leave, don't create a scene but Sir, what shall I do of that girl now? How would I know what to do with her? Go, send her to an orphanage As it is, they keep homeless people with them. Where will I keep her in the police station? get up, leave now yes better, sir any update about Aroob? not yet It's not that I am a stone-hearted person, and I am not upset about her going missing but.. but what? But thank God that crazy girl didn't go missing from my house. otherwise, Naveed & Ahsan would have blamed me for everything That I have hidden her somewhere You think about quite weird things leave this topic & tell me, Aroob is not there in that house anymore Won't Farah have any problem with doing the wedding directly now? Just now she went missing, and Ahsan is so worried, and you are talking about the wedding in this situation? not right away A gap of 2 to 3 months is important; by then, Ahsan will also become a bit composed there is a possibility that Aroob comes back No, I don't think so I don't think we'll be able to find that crazy girl ever again. Just do one thing: pull Farah away from the stubbornness of engagement first, and then arrange the wedding ceremony So that I can bring Farah to my house quickly after making her the bride. Okay I will talk to Farah don't cry my child, please I want to go to my aunty yes yes, Khadim has gone to find her. He will be back anytime don't cry my child, please Okay, tell me. What is your husband's name? husband? Yes, husband. I mean the one you got married to. after all, that guy must have some name. Right? I am so small aunty, what are you saying? How can I get married? She is married if you didn't get married then what is this? what? What are you talking about? what is it? are you back? What did the police say? what will they say, mom? they told me off anyways, serve the lunch I am hungry Okay dear, I am serving I tried searching for her a lot, but I don't know where she has gone missing. I can't find her. When she went missing from within you, that's when she vanished from your sight try to find her in yourself do you see her anywhere? She was never gone from within me, as she is my love love or responsibility? responsibility! I think you don't have love for her inside you, but it's a sense of responsibility what are you saying? If you lose your love, then a person becomes very upset and sad And when a person doesn't fulfill his responsibility, then he feels a sense of regret You are not sad about Aroob's disappearance; in fact, you are remorseful and worried. See, I haven't come here to argue with you. I came here so that you might help me in finding Aroob. I am helping you By proving my emotions as false? if your emotions got hurt by any of my words then I apologize but... But I was trying to help you look within yourself and find yourself I haven't gone missing anywhere that I need to find myself Aroob went missing, so please help me find her Okay tell me, how can I help you? Find out through your knowledge where she is right now I don't have knowledge of the unseen Oh! it means that you cannot help me. Let me find her myself Let me request you once again, if love has gone missing from within you, then don't try to search for it outside. Because now Aroob is with that person who surely had love for her in their heart. and for sure, she must be happy there Are you sure wherever she may be, she must be happy? do you think I don't love Aroob anymore? please say something When a person suppresses their emotions to attain their love Then the situation guides him to his destination itself But the condition is that emotions must be pure Mr. Ahsan, you shall go & talk to yourself. Have a dialogue with yourself So that you can recognize yourself A person is strange; they can reach the depths of the seas but cannot reach the depths of their own heart. The heart searches through all the oceans Who can attain the hearts of the beloved? yes yes, send him Greetings sir! greetings! Mr. Raeed Dilawar Khan has recommended you and I am sure that you will handle the work yes sir, absolutely Mr. Dilawar is a renowned person in our village sit thank you, sir what is your name? sir, my name is Khadim Khadim look, I have a cattle farm it has 80 buffaloes, recently I have purchased 10 from Australia I got to know that you've graduated from a government university and I want an educated man for my cattle farm I think you will handle it its a manager's job will you do it? why not sir?

Now both of them will play together yes yes... may God bless my girl with good fate Ok listen, I am saying it to you Aroob get your female doll married to this male doll but Madhuri is already married to Shahrukh, how can she marry him? Really? So where is Shahrukh? Shahrukh must be with aunty its a sad news So, do one thing. Make him Madhuri's friend yes! good idea. He will be Madhuri's friend, new friend But... but, what is his name? how would I know? you tell me I shall tell? His name should be Salman or Amir, or Anil Kapoor hey, not any filmy name. Tell me some genuine name from here oho, in what argument you've been into? Khadim has brought him, so we'll keep his name as Khadim. What do you say? mom, how come Khadim as my name is Khadim No No, this is correct name. Since Khadim uncle has brought it, so his name will be Khadim Khadim... Khadim, Khadim! this is Madhuri's new friend "Khadim" she is such a nice girl may God bless her with good fate her fate is good, mom Now see, it's been a few days since she came, and I got a job today. really! you got a job? yes mom Thanks to God a million times really, girls bring their good fate along with them thanks my Lord aunty... give it to me oh, thank you! I have to do a lot of wedding preparations as of yet Very few days are left, and I am alone. I don't understand how everything will be done. Ma'am, the wedding cards have arrived. I have kept them upstairs. you did very well. Is Ahsan at home? yes how is Ahsan's mood now? Any better? he stays lost at all times day before yesterday he came to my room, and was looking at Aroob's belongings really? Was he saying something? No, he stayed quiet even though I had asked him It's okay, once he gets married, Farah will handle him herself after coming into this house yes yes aunty please explain her I had already told you guys about mine & Farah's relation now make her understand, why is she crying? Dear, I agree that you had told us. But even we had told you something in the beginning what do you mean, what you had told me? means, whenever you'll marry you will do two marriages with Farah as well as with Mahi but, now you are saying that you'll do he wedding after 3 weeks its obvious, Mahi will cry dear look, we have to face our neighbors. We are answerable to people people? which people? look, you aren't a small kid who doesn't understand my point you come to our house daily, your car is parked outside. So people ask us, that who is he so we told them that you are our to-be son-in-law but aunty, we had decided earlier that we won't tell people about my marriage with Mahi yes yes, I am still firm on my words. I haven't announced it anywhere but tell me yourself, the marriage won't happen secretly The religious clerk will come; we also need a few people from our neighbors to witness. now everything cannot stay hidden like this honestly speaking, I had so many desires for my daughter's wedding I had thought that I would organize my daughter's wedding with complete pageantry But I have hidden all of my desires while considering your constraints mom, you don't need to beg him to marry me I will live without him Mahi, please don't say this why I shouldn't? If Aroob can live alone due to her mental health, then why can't I? No... Mahi I will never leave you alone Okay, fine... I I promise you one thing one day before my wedding with Farah I will marry Mahi dear, she is full term pregnant now Will you take her to a lady doctor, or should I talk to the midwife who lives in our neighborhood? Mom, I can take her but what will I say to the doctor? who am I to her, whose baby is it. Etc... true that Okay then, let me talk to the midwife and what will you say to the midwife? that's fine I will keep some money in her hand, so she won't ask many questions from me Wow, O Lord, Your glory! She who lacks sense is carrying a baby inside her a girl who is a kid herself she is giving birth to a baby Wow God! your glory.. Glory be to God oh God! it seems as if everything has become so expensive what as such happened, mom? One needs so many things for wedding preparations. And the price of everything is skyrocketing what is the need to do so much of expense? Call a few people at home & do it in a simple manner What are you saying? You are my only daughter, and I will celebrate your wedding with complete pageantry what happened, Farah? you seem worried don't know but I am feeling as if something is happening wrong don't think this way my dear, everything will be fine did you talk to Ahsan? I talk to him daily but.. but what? The closer our wedding date approaches, the more Ahsan seems to be distancing himself from me is Aroob still on his mind? I don't know whether its Aroob, or something else. Which is distancing Ahsan from me Farah, maybe its all your delusion I am a girl, whether we get to know anything or not But when a man loses interest, we usually notice it right away then why don't you clearly ask Ahsan, what is the problem? its still not late Yes, he is coming here shortly. Let me talk to him clearly now Okay, anyways I am going inside Ouch! mom...
what happened? this ill-mannered baby kicks me mom, say him something he annoys me. Else I will also beat him okay let me tell me. Don't you dare bad guy, why are you kicking my daughter? now if you'll kick my daughter, then I will scold you do you hear me? Ouch! Mom, he has kicked me once again really? Fine... lets not give him food for a day as a punishment, say what? what? but mom, then he'll feel hungry & he will cry what will I do then? let him cry, he is a bad child, Why does he kicks you? He is not bad, but good he is my baby really? Okay, let me bring food for you Ok? don't worry, first I will feed you the food then I will eat. Ok? Wow my Lord wow! what you have made a mother even if she is crazy still, she is worried about her baby All praise to God The girl who fell in love for the first time and trusted him is his father. And the man of my life, my father, left me in my childhood after deceiving me. we girls we cannot make decision that who & how our father will be but we can choose our life partner as per our own will and why do I feel That a man whom I have chosen willingly will run away after breaking my trust. Farah look... a marriage is a social contract for me but I ensure you that I will never break this social contract What? Marriage is just a social contract for you!
