[0.04] We girls cannot decide
[2.52] who and how our father will be but
[5.48] we can choose our life partner as per our wish
[8.40] and why do I feel that the
[12.36] man whom I chose of my own free will also
[14.92] break my trust and run away but
[16.88] along with the Nikah Nama,
[18.20] Mahi will have to sign a compromise as well
[21.60] your truth is that you have
[24.88] never loved anyone till date and neither are you in love today
[28.96] you have been pretending to be the person who
[32.16] you are
[37.98] [Music]
[48.76] No, this is such a big city, I don't know
[53.28] what condition my daughter would be in, where are you,
[57.24] here all the wolves are roaming around, there is
[60.60] something else to eat, the
[63.92] baby is not hungry
[68.32] and is there a
[71.44] baby in your womb, I wish
[75.76] I had not called you that day and invited you to the house,
[78.36] Abbu would not have seen us and he would
[81.12] not have died, shh, had I not called you in the morning,
[84.80] then Aroob would not have
[87.28] roamed around, you come to our house everyday, your
[90.04] car is parked outside, then people
[92.16] ask us who is this
[94.80] brother, I told you that you are our future
[97.80] son in law, as the wedding date is coming closer
[101.16] By the way, he is getting away from me. Is
[103.84] Aroob still on his mind?
[107.20] Wow, my lord, wow, what have you done to your mother? The
[112.96] man a girl
[116.56] loves and trusts first is her
[119.24] father.
[120.44] And that man of my life, my father,
[125.00] betrayed me in my childhood and left.
[127.84] We girls cannot take decisions about
[131.40] who and how our father will be, but
[134.44] we can choose our life partner as per our wish.
[137.36] And why do I feel that the
[141.36] man whom I chose as per my wish will also
[144.00] break my trust and run away.
[146.24] Look Farab,
[150.00] for me, marriage is a social contract.
[152.96] I can definitely assure you
[155.44] that I will never break this social contract. Is
[157.24] marriage just a social contract for you?
[160.76] Yes, you are educated and
[163.48] intelligent. What am I saying wrong in this? That
[165.88] is, for you, marriage is just a
[168.56] name of two people's signatures written on a paper.
[171.44] Heart and emotions are not involved in this relationship.
[174.52] Heart and
[175.84] emotions. What do you think that
[178.12] my feelings for Roop have ended or
[180.88] my place in his heart has ended
[183.16] even after the accident?  There were emotions and heart too,
[187.52] but only his mind
[190.68] stopped supporting him
[195.72] and then what remained of our marriage except a paper
[198.32] contract
[202.20] and in the end both of us are
[204.96] husband and wife till today just because of a piece of paper. Here
[207.40] I am talking about Mr. S and I have
[209.92] heart and mind
[211.64] and you too have heart and mind, right?
[215.24] Then why are we getting married
[217.52] because my mind says that if
[220.20] this marriage does not happen then Mama will be shocked and
[224.04] my heart cannot afford this, but
[230.12] yes friend, why do you start this debate again and again,
[233.52] our wedding cards have been made,
[237.24] right? It is not necessary that everyone's
[239.84] marriage or arranged marriages also happen and when
[244.32] two people live with each other, then the heart
[247.36] and emotions also meet and if they do not meet, then
[251.72] brother, see, if you stay with a pet for so long, you get
[255.92] attached to that too, the pet is
[257.68] telling itself, right?
[260.04] You are telling yourself, you have to
[262.72] die saying that I
[280.88] loved this doll like you, Assalam Walekum Walekum Assalam
[284.72] Abba come sit here, I will bring food for you, come
[289.20] sit down
[296.76] brother what's happening today it's only Madhuri,
[302.64] Khadim is not visible, Khadim is
[306.60] too much, we locked him in the room,
[310.72] why, what did he do, he does
[315.12] n't take Madhuri for a walk, oh ho ho,
[319.84] this is a very bad thing, then I will take her for a walk,
[322.24] Khadim doll will take her for a
[325.12] walk, you will not take her
[329.38] [Music]
[330.84] ok then tell me whom do I have to take for a
[333.92] walk, you will take me for a walk,
[339.44] yes let's go now, ok, now
[343.44] this Amma will bring food, let's finish,
[348.28] son, food,
[352.00] oh son, that tai had come, she was saying that the
[358.00] child may not be normal, so consult a lady
[367.16] doctor once, yes son, Bhali Mai was saying that for the
[372.08] sake of a few bucks I
[375.68] cannot put the life of the mother and the child in danger,
[379.60] ok, ok, get
[385.24] up, let's go,
[389.96] where should we go son, that Amma was saying, take me for a
[394.48] walk, so take me for a walk and then come, ok, let's go, come,  Think about it,
[402.76] ok, I will take her out for a walk and then leave, we will
[407.84] eat and then go, Amma, we are going,
[411.64] yes, let's go first,
[414.88] as you wish,
[416.92] son, Amma, you also go,
[420.24] mother, you all go and roam around and come back
[423.24] some other time, ok, let's go, ch ch,
[428.16] hey Mashallah
[431.09] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
[492.48] Aunt
[494.48] also,
[496.36] hello, hello, where is aunt also? I have
[501.36] seen her in the market, what
[505.92] happened, whom did you see comfortably, whom did you see,
[511.60] Roop, where did you see her,
[515.92] I was standing here, she has passed in front of me
[519.20] in a car, I am going
[521.56] behind her, I am going behind her, you do this, you come home
[525.88] immediately, you come home, if
[530.80] I come home, she will again get lost,
[533.92] you should listen to what I am saying, you should come home immediately,
[537.64] and after reaching home, you should just
[541.24] meet me directly, ok,
[549.04] good, where did you come from, it
[561.16] could be an illusion of your eyes, I have grown
[565.24] old but not so
[568.68] old that you cannot recognize your Aroop,
[571.40] your
[575.92] Aroop, okay, let's do
[579.00] this, now in this matter  Let's leave it at that.
[584.44] Yes, don't mention this to anyone else.
[591.52] Look, Khala Di, Aisen is getting married in a few days.
[595.52] You know that
[597.76] if we bring up this Arup episode, then
[602.92] all that drama will
[605.88] start again. Please tell the story of Urup. But
[610.28] Urup is Munne Miya's wife.
[613.16] Khala, I am doing this for the happiness of that Munne Miya.
[617.28] I am his mother.
[620.40] I don't want that my son's life
[623.32] gets filled with happiness and he can live peacefully. But the
[627.60] sister of this house is with unknown people. Who
[630.64] knows what condition she would be in. Khala, when someone
[634.56] dies, do we know
[636.88] what condition he would be in. But our daughter didn't die,
[639.84] Khala, for us, Arup is now dead. What are
[644.76] you saying, Labhi?
[647.92] If you told this to Aisen, then
[650.04] it means that you are
[653.28] not happy with Aisen's happiness
[655.80] and whoever is against my son's happiness,
[660.96] I will not let him stay in this house. What do
[663.88] you mean, that you are understanding me correctly?
[671.04] Look, if the happiness of this house is dear to you,
[674.76] then you will not talk about this to anyone else
[678.72] and if you have any problem, then
[682.24] please leave this house and go to your Arup
[684.96] today itself
[688.65] [Music]
[699.26] [Music]
[713.36] Why should so much money be spent on a cattle farm?
[717.12] According to me,
[720.56] at least this much investment should be made to run a cattle farm in a modern way, the rest is up to
[722.04] you.
[729.24] I have already invested a lot and the
[732.60] income is negligible.
[736.56] You are saying that more money should be spent.
[739.88] Why, look sir, according to my calculation,
[744.16] you will be earning at least 18 to 20 lakhs
[746.92] and if we invest 60 lakhs more on this,
[750.32] then your income will increase to 28 to
[753.72] 30 lakhs and this is a good profit for the company.
[757.00] One minute, one
[759.80] minute, tell me one thing, who told you that my
[763.64] income is 18 to 20 lakh
[768.76] rupees? My income is barely
[772.00] three to four lakh rupees.
[779.92] Sir, how is it
[781.80] possible, according to my calculations?  So
[784.28] this is happening
[785.52] sir sir there seems to be something wrong you see sir
[791.00] I did the calculation
[800.67] [Music]
[809.04] [Music]
[828.59] [Music]
[837.81] [Music]
[853.92] Amma by the way I don't understand what you are saying what I do
[857.16] n't understand is that
[860.88] how can my and Aesan's marriage remain hidden from everyone it is
[862.96] obvious when all the people of the neighborhood will
[866.00] come then this thing will be revealed in front of everyone
[868.64] yes so what if it is revealed to us then why were you
[871.76] convincing Aesan that our
[873.88] marriage will remain hidden from everyone if it is
[875.68] revealed then let it be revealed and to be honest
[879.64] I also want that everyone should know
[882.56] just Aesan should not know that we
[886.48] told this to everyone
[887.33] [Music] hey
[890.16] mummy what are you saying I will
[895.56] not support you in this type of plan of yours right what nonsense are you talking I am talking
[898.24] nonsense Amma I am saying absolutely right
[900.32] tomorrow Aesan will become my husband I do
[903.92] n't want to put him in any difficulty or trouble hey
[905.40] look just look am
[908.68] I doing all this for myself
[910.92] ok tell me one thing at the time of marriage are you
[914.80] asking me for a house for yourself or not or are you going to live in
[916.64] this rented house all your life  You will continue to live in the house
[918.16] Ammi I don't want anything like this
[920.00] I will not put any such condition for the marriage
[922.08] You may stay dead in this rented house
[925.44] but you will definitely remember these words of mine later You have gone
[929.88] mad completely
[933.80] [Music]
[959.92] You have spoiled it [Music] Son, please tell me a firm date
[962.44] so that I can talk to the Maulvi and the people in advance
[964.56] My wedding function is on the 21st
[968.80] so this is also your wedding
[974.44] Yes, obviously you are right,
[980.68] then keep the date 19th Yes, yes, okay
[986.52] Anyway the Nikah will take place on the 19th
[990.80] But along with the Nikah Nama,
[993.84] mother will also have to sign a consent form
[1001.60] Yes, and because
[1004.04] you have no objection to my marrying Fara
[1010.60] because before my marriage to her you have
[1015.64] already become my wife and this will legally not be
[1019.92] your second but your third marriage because Fara will
[1023.00] not be your second wife but your third wife
[1024.72] Yes, son, why will mother refuse to
[1028.44] your marriage with Fara And this has
[1031.80] already been decided between us, right?
[1035.92] I have one more condition as well
[1039.04] Condition
[1042.40] Yes, the condition is that on the second day of marriage, you
[1047.92] people will have to shift from this attachment,
[1050.92] but look,
[1055.56] I don't want
[1057.76] you people to stay in this locality after our marriage, everybody here
[1060.76] knows us, it should
[1063.88] not happen that the news gets out,
[1068.84] where will we go, why in this city,
[1074.08] but we cannot get any other house, yes,
[1077.00] why would I mind, but I mind,
[1080.80] why would I mind because I will not
[1084.60] move from one rented house to another rented
[1087.32] house,
[1091.80] yes,
[1094.24] Mahi is saying absolutely right, now you
[1097.76] tell yourself, will the daughter-in-law of a family like yours
[1102.44] feel good living in a rented house,
[1104.28] but I am
[1107.68] not asking you for a bungalow or a big house, a
[1110.88] small house or a flat which she can call her own so soon,
[1115.76] but nowadays even a flat is not available for less than one and a half crore,
[1119.96] yes this is true,
[1123.52] but brother, look, every girl thinks
[1125.72] that she should move from her father's house to her own
[1127.80] house, now look, every girl
[1131.64] wants her own safety, now tomorrow when she will have children,
[1134.92] they will also need a roof, right? What are you
[1144.76] thinking,
[1147.64] this  I am thinking from where will I arrange so much money at once.
[1151.88] Son,
[1155.40] what do one or two crores matter to you? Brother, no, that's not the
[1157.84] issue. But all the bank accounts are in
[1160.96] dad's name. Whatever I need, whenever I
[1164.08] need it, I ask him for it.
[1170.16] And I am thinking in
[1172.40] whose name will I ask for so much money at once. Brother, I am
[1176.04] sure you will do something. Now
[1180.04] you just tell me
[1182.68] in which area to get that flat or house, whatever it is, so that I can
[1185.24] talk to the agency people.
[1187.16] Okay, I will tell you
[1193.55] [Music]
[1205.76] Son, I was thinking that so many months have passed since Arup came here. I
[1214.04] do
[1216.08] n't know what his family must be going through.
[1219.28] Amma is right. They must be worried, right?
[1224.24] Or Amma, it could also be that they are happy that they
[1229.44] lost their lives from this crazy girl.
[1231.08] Oh no
[1233.36] son, no one can lose their own life from one's own people, no matter how
[1237.28] crazy she is,
[1244.76] God will know Amma what is right and
[1248.76] what is wrong. Well, tell me, did you find out about that lady doctor?
[1254.68] Now, there are not many days left.
[1259.52] Yes, I spoke to a friend. He told me the
[1262.64] address and name of a doctor. He says she is
[1265.80] a little expensive and does good work.  yes ma ok then it's fine
[1270.40] we will take her tomorrow itself

[1356.84] difficult
[1359.04] ok congratulations to you in advance ok
[1364.88] then I am leaving see
[1368.64] you stupid girl you could have at least asked
[1373.40] who am I getting married to on 19th
[1377.90] [music]  I
[1383.72] cannot understand what is happening to me It
[1385.40] seems as if I am stuck in a swamp The
[1387.84] more I try to pull myself out,
[1390.28] the more I am being defied
[1392.88] You are a liar What
[1397.16] lies have I told
[1403.96] you You keep lying to yourself
[1407.88] and keep on saying I lie to myself
[1414.32] Yes, and now you are unable to bear the weight of that lie I am
[1419.36] sorry I am
[1422.76] not able to understand What are you trying to say
[1424.60] ok tell me the truth The truth why do you
[1427.24] come to me Maybe so that you can give me some advice
[1431.60] Tell me some such thing which can bring
[1434.72] peace in my life Then you are talking nonsense
[1439.04] Then you are lying again You come to me only
[1442.84] because you want to hear your truth from me Consciousness does not
[1448.40] lie and neither do I lie But
[1451.84] your truth is that you have never
[1455.40] loved anyone till date nor have you been
[1459.64] pretending to be a person
[1462.80] which you are
[1466.16] not You are a hungry and demanding person from inside
[1470.44] who cannot see anything except his hunger and desire
[1476.36] What are you saying in front of you
[1479.32] but you were not able to see her
[1482.12] because she was not able to satisfy your physical desires
[1487.28] you call this love, you don't
[1490.72] tell the truth to others, nor to yourself,
[1498.44] why are you going to board two boats,
[1500.48] two boats? Yes, why did
[1503.88] you not decide to board two boats together?
[1506.36] Yes, then why do you complain
[1509.64] that you are going to get stuck in a swamp?
[1516.04] Who told you this? I
[1520.24] mean, how do you know that I
[1524.76] tell the truth, that's why I hear the truth of others?
[1530.02] [Music] I
[1536.76] am such a bad person, I had no idea about this. You roam
[1540.12] around wearing the mask of a very good person,
[1543.88] actually you are an ordinary person, that's why you
[1548.40] remain more troubled. Then you
[1550.72] tell me what should I do?
[1576.80] Tell me the truth,
[1578.84] uru, uru my child, where had you gone? I went
[1583.84] mad looking for you,
[1586.36] son. Now I have found my aunt,
[1588.84] yes,
[1590.00] son, who are these people? This is Amma and that
[1595.24] Khadim. Assalam Walekum Walekum Assalam
[1598.84] Adi. My son found her standing alone on the road.
[1604.60] Yes, I am saying the right thing.  We had
[1608.00] even filed a police report. I swear by Allah that we did
[1611.32] not bring her here by force. Now if you
[1614.08] want, you can ask them yourself. No, sister,
[1618.08] I am not thinking like that. You people
[1620.24] seem like very good people to me. But
[1623.52] how come you have come here all day long. That is
[1628.20] why you have brought her for a checkup.
[1633.00] It would have been better if you had got her checked up first and then we would have
[1636.36] sat and talked peacefully.
[1642.38] [Sangeet]
[1654.64] Adi, she is your daughter, she was a trust with us. You
[1659.28] may take her.
[1660.80] Aunt is also dead to us.
[1667.04] And if Aroob is dearer to you than the happiness of this house,
[1671.68] then you can leave this house and go from here right now.
[1679.47] [Sangeet]
[1689.12] Adi, what are you thinking? No, no,
[1692.04] nothing. Adi, I will
[1697.28] pack Aroop's belongings. You may take her.
[1700.76] No, no, there are some issues right now. When the
[1704.96] situation gets better, I will come and take her.
[1711.40] You keep her with you for some time.
[1721.24] Here,
[1723.44] son, put your number in it and save my number.
[1732.44] This is fine. I have done this. But right now,
[1736.04] I cannot tell you anything more.
[1738.72] But in short, this is that  Arub is an orphan
[1742.20] girl
[1743.12] and daughter-in-law of a very big businessman of the city.
[1750.60] After marriage, she became mentally 6 years old in an accident.
[1754.40] Yes, then take her along.
[1758.16] Why are you not taking her along? I will
[1761.16] tell you the details later. But Doctor Shaila
[1764.28] says that it is possible that she may deliver next week
[1767.60] and she will try to ensure that the
[1771.20] baby is normal and there is no need for an operation.
[1774.28] Look Aadi, we are very poor people. We have taken
[1779.24] care of your daughter for our own good.
[1782.28] This goodness should not become a burden on us.
[1786.72] No, sister, there is nothing like that. Since you have been
[1790.40] so kind, keep her for some more time for my sake.
[1793.80] And yes Doctor Shaila will
[1798.32] not take even a rupee from you.
[1802.20] You are here. You will stay here now.
[1806.36] No,
[1807.28] son, I am leaving but I will keep coming.
[1813.16] Okay, next time when you come, I will bring my Shahrukh.
[1816.44] Yes, son, now when I come, I will bring
[1819.72] your doll. Okay, I will wait for you Aadi.
[1824.20] You are going but we will be
[1829.00] worried behind. You came to meet your daughter after such a long time
[1832.12] and then you are not taking her along as well.
[1835.20] If not, the fact is that the daughter's mother-in-law is
[1838.88] not  I want her to come home oh why what
[1842.60] crime has the girl committed she is unlucky her
[1846.04] poor mother-in-law did not like her anyway and on top of that she
[1850.24] became mad in the accident and
[1854.32] her
[1856.48] husband does not love her respect no no
[1859.88] he is very good but he is
[1862.48] helpless in front of his mother
[1865.24] and now she is getting him married again
[1868.36] and in such a situation if Urub goes there then
[1871.56] everything will be spoiled so then this means will
[1874.12] you never take Roop home no no it is not like that
[1876.64] when Uroop gives
[1881.04] birth to a child then I will talk to her father-in-law and take
[1884.24] her to our house as long as
[1886.92] my trust is with you it is fine Adi you should
[1891.16] not be worried she is our daughter too
