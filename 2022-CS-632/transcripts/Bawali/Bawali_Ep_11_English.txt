He doesn't lack any money though he roams around in a car worth 1.5 crores Mom, that car is not his own. He got it from the office besides, uncle has also refused to give him the money he has refused? then why are we searching for a flat like crazy people?

Everything is fine, Mom. I received a call from the guard at the cattle farm. There's a small problem, so I have to leave okay, then I am staying here Okay, but you must be tired.

yes yes also of the baby ok aunty, I am leaving. Do let me know as soon as they discharge her I will come to pick you guys okay dear okay Bye
bye! *playing with the baby* aunty... this is my daughter's small baby aunty.. is he my baby? yes dear he is your baby what do you want, tell me aunty, where is Ahsan? I didn't see him Dear, have you become fine? yes aunty, I am fine how are you, Aroob? I am fine, doctor I spoke with the renowned psychologist Dr. Mohsin, and he said Aroob was in great pain before her baby's delivery During that pain, her head got stuck to the bed and then she became unconscious because of our medicine Due to that, her brain suffered severe damage maybe that's why she got well So, does she remember everything now? yes yes, according to doctor Mohsin whatever happened is not less than a miracle but... 
but what? We need to see if Aroob has remembered everything from her past, but particularly whether she remembers the last 7 months or not Does this mean that Aroob has forgotten all the incidents and situations that occurred until now after the accident? We cannot be sure, but according to Dr. Mohsin, he says a patient remembers everything in a blurry manner So, there is a possibility that Aroob might remember a few things from the past 7 months what shall I do now? hey, why are you getting worried? You should tell this good news to her husband & family Aroob has given birth to a baby boy and she is doing well now good news? This news will hit that household like a disaster as a disaster! why so? oh doctor, its a long story please tell me, can I talk to Aroob about the last 7 months? I'm not a psychologist, but I would suggest not to mentally burden her okay, better. Thank you! Bye!
