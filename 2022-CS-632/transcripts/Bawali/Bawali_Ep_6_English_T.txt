[14.64] What's going on here?!
[17.55] Uncle...
[20.30] actually....
[21.44] if you know about their death on first day
[24.44] Why didn't you tell us?
[29.60] come on mama
[31.44] what should i tell you?
[33.44] They were killed by my hands
[36.24] i was depressed..
[38.64] And my concern was what to tell Aroob.
[41.30] You're a strange person.
[44.52] You want to get married and also not like anyone
[47.06] tell me you want to marry or not?
[49.56] You're talking about strange and unrelated things.
[52.76] I'll go crazy in this house.
[55.56] music
[69.42] Another soul has entered in Aroob
[73.64] and as long as this soul resides within.
[78.04] Its recovery may not be possible.
[81.06] "s Aroob feeling alright?
[84.82] aroob is pregnant
[86.82] She is going to become a mother.
[88.82] Tell me, who did Ahsan agree to marry?
[92.24] obviously with farha
[95.04] Is this Ahsan's decision or yours?
[98.06] it's my decision
[102.74] i will do whatever you want.... But you have to promise me something.
[119.60] anything
[121.60] you won't tell  Aroob to leaving this house.
[125.04] I was just wondering how you knew Aroob was pregnant
[135.24] I never said she was pregnant.
[137.90] You said she has another spirit inside her."
[142.12] Then we found out she is pregnant.
[145.30] I said what and you heard
[148.98] You misunderstood it's in the past now.
[153.42] now tell me what can i help you?
[156.32] Yes, I just wanted to know how you found out.
[163.02] Do you want to know this? Is this what you desire?
[168.92] and i desires
[171.98] that Somethings should be left unexplained, even if you don't want to understand them.
[177.22] get it?
[181.50] Alright, if you don't want to tell me, I'll go.
[188.26] In my opinion, it's important for you to know
[191.38] How will the battle within you end?
[198.00] What battle is raging inside me?
[200.28] No battle is happening inside
[202.28] noo..okay..
[206.18] you're here for yourself, not for you're wife.
[210.18] okay tell me
[212.40] There's no harm in accepting it
[215.44] The burden on the mind becomes lighter
[219.26] There is no burden on my mind
[222.36] i don't even need lessons
[225.24] okay as you wish
[230.08] But before you go, please consider my point
[235.04] what? don't fight with yourself
[239.32] Let yourself flow like a smooth stream
[243.26] Only listen to your heart
[245.44] Leave the rest to nature
[252.58] Thank you for your time
[260.12] Drown yourself in your thoughts and you'll find that life is mine, not yours; but yours is your own.
