[0.52] You can ask whoever you want to,
[3.44] but the Khadim should get a job by tomorrow,
[5.64] who are you? Yes, who are you to
[9.88] give orders?
[17.39] [Music]
[19.56] Ding Marathi, you started marrying not once but twice.
[24.92] Now that you are sick, should I marry one too?
[31.67] [Music]
[44.24] I used to sit near Khadim till midnight
[46.76] and keep bothering him. The poor guy never
[48.92] said anything.
[51.12] And sometimes I used to sleep near Khadim.
[58.04] And you know,
[60.72] Khadim gives a very good massage. We have
[63.80] hired a boy who works on our farm.
[66.96] Khadim, clear all his accounts today.
[69.40] Pay off all the Tuesdays.
[71.92] He should not be seen in the office or on the farm from tomorrow.
[73.48] Now, if you want to marry me, then do it in a
[75.52] normal way. Bring your parents to
[78.12] my house. Talk to my mother and distribute
[80.88] my wedding cards.
[83.00] Everything should
[85.52] happen normally. Your father loved you a lot.
[94.68] Everyone has a fixed time to leave. Don't
[98.12] burden yourself with this. Am
[118.84] I such a bad person that  No
[121.48] one is ready to accept me
[126.48] Surely I must
[130.16] be at fault, otherwise all this wouldn't have happened to me But
[134.04] what is my fault? Maybe I
[138.72] thought of life as a moving train Sometimes I got into one
[141.88] bogie, sometimes into another bogie But
[145.20] life is not the name of a moving train
[147.56] Rather life is the name of a plate
[151.84] Where many trains come and go
[157.24] On my platform my companion was formless
[160.24] But I left her standing There
[163.88] I
[167.04] should go back to my companion, my form Be it a day like your beauty Or
[171.72] a night like your hair My love, my
[182.16] heart, I have been
[188.64] searching for you
[195.42] [Sangeet]
[210.40] What's the matter, you look worried
[214.12] No,
[217.40] nothing, let me give you an advice As if I were
[224.96] saying,
[227.28] stop thinking like a mother-in-law,
[232.12] think like a grandmother Trust me, all your problems will end Your worries will end, what do you keep
[235.80] telling me again and again
[240.32] Yes, I have not
[243.08] heaped any mountains of oppression on your innocent daughter-in-law, On the contrary, I am
[247.12] her victim, I am her
[249.84] victim Why are you getting angry with me, friend?
[253.24] I have just given you an advice
[257.48] [Sangeet] A warning to
[266.44] you  Walekum Khadim, why did you ever
[271.72] trap us poor people in your trap, but
[275.52] why you, what has happened, what was supposed to happen,
[280.04] this poor man lost his job, how can this happen, it is
[284.56] possible, Esan sahab is the owner, he
[288.60] fired him from the job, it is his wish,
[292.32] you
[293.20] wait, I will see, I will not let this happen, let it be,
[297.72] why do you
[302.32] trap yourself because of me without any reason, how can you not study, you have
[306.24] lost your job because of me, you are saying that
[308.08] I should not study,
[309.40] wait in the meantime Khadim, I will
[312.08] call you back in half an hour,
[314.04] okay
[318.28] [music]
[326.32] Assalam Walekum Walekum Alam Salam
[330.32] sit down,
[339.52] son uncle, do you know who gave me water when I had gone missing,
[344.08] no son, who were those
[349.08] people,
[350.84] a widow lady and her
[355.48] son,
[357.80] okay, son, we can pray for them, may
[361.04] Allah bless them, Allah will definitely do good to them,
[366.08] but we did not do any good to them,
[369.80] what do you mean, that boy's name is Khadim, he
[376.96] was an employee with you,
[378.92] Khadim, yes, but son, Khadim never
[383.64] mentioned the fact that you were with him,
[385.28] he did not even know  He came to know that I am your daughter-in-law
[389.72] when I invited him for dinner yesterday to
[392.92] thank him. Well, the
[396.76] man is really a very good and a very
[400.88] noble boy, but his goodness has been rewarded by his
[404.28] dismissal from the job by Esan.
[407.20] But how can Esan do this? Esan has
[411.56] done this,
[412.64] son. But why would he do this?
[417.16] Why would he do this?
[420.56] Maybe he is feeling guilty,
[425.92] guilty,
[427.60] guilty that he could
[429.96] not take care of me, that is, his own wife.
[433.80] And maybe he is also jealous that the
[438.08] caretaker took care of his wife. What nonsense are you talking about?
[441.04] You have asked N.
[444.24] What should I ask him when the caretaker himself has
[447.08] told me. Well done, you trust the words of a stranger
[450.64] and not your husband. The one whom
[453.36] you are calling a stranger,
[455.72] your daughter-in-law was with him for six months and the same stranger has
[459.72] also taken responsibility of your daughter-in-law in every way.
[464.56] How dare you talk to me in such manners?
[468.12] You don't know how to talk.
[470.76] Cool down, what has happened?
[473.84] How much courage do I have and how daring am I
[478.44] and how much  You probably do
[481.48] n't know that I can misbehave
[483.20] Naveed you are looking at this she does
[487.00] n't have the manners to talk to me, I am
[490.44] cooling down,
[493.36] son don't talk like this I will talk to
[497.80] her you can ask whoever you want to ask
[500.76] but by tomorrow the Khadim should get the job who are
[503.80] you yes who are
[507.64] you to give orders I will also see
[510.88] who hires that boy aunty don't
[513.20] shout too much your health will deteriorate
[517.20] uncle please re-hire the Khadim by tomorrow
[520.20] otherwise what will I do you tell me
[522.24] what will you do I will get the Khadim a
[526.12] job again
[528.28] somewhere but you must find a new daughter in law for yourself
[541.52] anyway aunty is very fond of getting Asan married for the second time

[585.80] fire in her eyes, there is fire of a boy
[593.20] in her eyes, when this
[595.28] fire flares up inside a woman, then
[599.12] this fire does not go away without taking revenge, I am telling you, she will
[605.68] take revenge, now you are getting too over it,

[622.92] who told you and Aroob has just left after informing me,
[627.36] but son, why did you fire him,
[634.80] Dad, actually
[637.40] he was not doing his work properly, that's why
[640.68] I told Kamran to fire him,
[648.36] you did the right thing, but what was Arup saying, and madam went away
[652.24] saying that if Khadim is
[654.96] not kept on the job, then she will leave the house, will
[657.40] she leave me, look

[738.08] or not, but because of you,

[1384.60] heed to such things, but
[1388.24] something came to my mind and I said it to him Labh, you are
[1391.60] right, we can get it done, in your view, there is
[1395.08] some Amil or something, yes, in my view, there are
[1397.84] many, but why doesn't Esan Miya go
[1401.36] where he used to go, did he go
[1405.80] to Esan Amil, yes, when you
[1408.88] were sick, did he go to someone like that,
[1413.00] okay Labhi, I see
[1417.02] [Sangeet] that with a
[1425.12] broken heart, step by step,
[1431.40] from a broken heart, I am always searching for you
[1439.14] [Sangeet],
[1445.44] I have been
[1448.08] searching for you,
[1453.72] uncle has told me to take care of you,
[1458.04] but I am not able to understand, should I take
[1461.40] care of you the way
[1464.48] you did of me when I was sick,
[1476.68] I don't
[1479.72] know whether you are listening to all these things of mine and are understanding
[1484.48] them or
[1488.92] not, I still want to say, want to
[1491.88] say a lot,
[1495.16] I also remember that day
[1499.36] when you told me I love you for the first time,
[1504.48] proposed me for marriage,
[1507.24] you loved me so much
[1510.69] [Sangeet] I took care of
[1513.52] you, you took care of me, I remember everything
[1523.04] Now you
[1526.64] tell me I know everything I remember everything So should
[1529.76] I take care of you
[1532.23] [Music]
[1538.04] or
[1541.72] should I do what you did to me
[1545.69] [Music]
[1547.16] Answer me asan
[1551.50] [Music]
[1553.60] Tell me I often think that when I was sick
[1560.40] you could not give me the closeness
[1562.48] that you wanted That is why
[1565.28] you sat down looking at Fara and my sister Mahi
[1575.52] What should happen when you are sick Is it
[1579.56] only a man's need and
[1585.36] not a woman's Is it only a man's right to
[1589.08] get the love of a healthy wife
[1593.40] That a woman has no emotions
[1597.65] [Music] When I was in my
[1599.60] arms you started getting married not once but twice
[1605.04] Now that you are sick should I also get married
[1611.88] [Music]
[1614.92] [Praise]
[1615.03] [Music]
[1623.72] Whatever you did to me, you did it I will
[1627.76] not
[1630.44] do anything Not because you love me [Music]
[1638.44] Only because you are the father of my child
[1643.00] And
[1646.55] [Music] Because
[1651.28] because I still love you I
[1655.68] still love you I love you a lot
[1661.52] Sometimes I go door to
[1665.96] door Sometimes I keep
[1673.36] searching for you
[1679.16] [Music]
[1681.96] The way a servant  You have taken care of my daughter-in-law.
[1685.48] I don't have words to thank you,
[1691.20] Sir. I did not support your daughter-in-law, but
[1693.72] a helpless, destitute girl.
[1697.20] Sir, it's fine, but she is
[1702.80] my daughter-in-law. Why are you embarrassing me,
[1706.52] Sir? Thank you. You have done a lot for us.
[1710.04] Whatever Khadim Aisa did to you, to
[1715.52] tell you the truth, I also regret it. No, Sir, why are you
[1720.92] regretting it. We are
[1722.24] clean people, what
[1727.24] can we say? He is right. We are the sahab people and we also have
[1733.08] young sons. What should we do?
[1737.04] Sir, Qadim Hasan has reinstated you in the job,
[1741.92] but it is important to say one more thing.
[1746.76] Sir,
[1749.00] tell me that from today onwards, you will not work at our cattle farm,
[1756.60] but you will be a 50 percent partner.
[1761.52] Sir, I am a partner. Yes, from today onwards, you will
[1767.12] not get salary,
[1768.84] but you will get 50 percent of whatever income we earn.
[1774.24] But why, Sir? I mean, because
[1778.56] if you were not there, my
[1780.28] daughter-in-law would not have been able to return to Shad with health, dignity and respect.
[1784.32] You have no idea
[1787.36] how happy we are because of her coming.
[1790.12] How much happiness we have got and whatever I am thankful to
[1793.24] you.  I am doing this for
[1795.00] that happiness, I am not asking for anything in return, that's
[1798.68] fine sir, but that Esan sahab,
[1803.52] it is my decision too and as far as
[1807.20] Esan is concerned, I will talk to him myself,
[1811.12] thank you, go ahead
[1817.22] [Music]
[1822.84] play, maybe
[1824.76] I don't know how to maintain relationships,
[1828.56] which relationship are you talking about, you have a relationship
[1831.64] with your employee in your office, you have a
[1834.92] relationship or connection with your neighbours
[1838.44] and you also have a relationship with your dear relatives,
[1841.92] I am sure that you
[1844.08] maintain that relationship well,
[1846.52] everything is fine there,
[1850.40] but I am talking about other relationships, yes, of
[1854.08] course, the relationships you are talking about are
[1858.12] relationships of love, normal
[1861.00] relationships are only maintained, one
[1863.76] lives in relationships of love,
[1866.60] that's why
[1869.04] instead of maintaining relationships of love, learn to live in this relationship, the
[1878.00] skill of living in a relationship is taught by the mind, the art of living is done by the heart, the
[1883.36] mind is not everywhere, sometimes you should
[1887.44] also work with the heart, it is
[1891.00] good to keep the mind close to the heart,
[1896.12] but sometimes leave it alone also
[1899.06] [Music]
[1908.68] oh what to think  Why are you smiling, have you
[1917.44] made plans for a second marriage? After getting
[1918.64] hurt and suffering so much, I have understood one thing. You
[1927.48] can get someone through planning,
[1930.60] but the heart cannot be attached to that person.
[1935.40] And it is not possible to deal in love forcefully.
[1939.20] You are my love.
[1942.56] I am your wife.
[1948.68] Who says that wife is not love
[1951.03] [Music]
[1955.92] S I love you
[1962.17] [Music]
