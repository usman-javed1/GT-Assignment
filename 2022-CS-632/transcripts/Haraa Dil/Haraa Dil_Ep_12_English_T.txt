[0.20] Lose heart Sajna Lose heart Sajna Sajna
[13.16] friend I have got married I have not committed any crime
[16.72] Nobody supported me in my compulsion
[19.84] And now whoever is getting the
[22.44] chance is cursing me
[24.24] I have no objection to your second marriage
[26.48] But you should have at least talked to me
[29.64] And if you had asked me then
[33.60] I would have found some such a noble and educated lady for you who would have been
[39.36] suitable for you You have crossed all limits don
[44.36] Please I am very sorry Barar I am sorry
[49.04] I have always helped you I have
[53.16] supported you in everything If you had
[55.80] shared it with me here then I would have
[58.64] advised you to marry this woman I have
[61.20] met her once But many times
[67.44] one glance is enough to know someone's family and character I do
[69.84] not agree with you at all On
[71.68] listening to Atul Bhabhi's words I
[78.04] started doubting even her family background Today you will see
[81.97] [Sangeet]
[85.60] Amatula Relationships do not change with change of circumstances But
[88.84] change of glance in relationships  What do you
[92.36] mean, which relationship has
[95.56] cracked? I don't make any profit.
[98.00] I can never give your wife the
[100.44] status that Shagufta Bhabhi had
[102.40] in my eyes. But I never
[105.12] gave her the status of Shagufta.
[108.24] Whatever I have done, I have done it out of helplessness. Sameer would have
[111.52] cried. Sometimes I would have worked in this house, sometimes in that house,
[115.40] or would have taken
[117.28] care of it. Then I also got the girls married.
[120.44] I am not so selfish that I would
[122.68] keep them tied to the house for my happiness.
[126.12] But this matter should end here.
[130.16] Afan
[136.47] [Music]
[142.64] Afan. Whatever I did, I did it
[145.48] for your welfare. But you all are
[148.20] unique daughters of the world. You are not happy under any circumstances.
[151.32] Your father's house is getting settled.
[154.48] This child is getting the support of his mother. You should have
[158.28] thanked me.
[161.08] What benefit did I give you and do you want to
[164.76] take commission from Abrar Bhai? With a lot of apologies, aunty, that
[168.28] friend of yours, she herself
[171.20] behaves like a 16-year-old girl. And
[173.52] how did you get such a small amount of money from me?  She seems to be the mother of the child.
[175.32] Neither is she 16 years old nor is her
[178.00] behavior, she is a very sensible nurse and
[181.60] moreover she is in your father's marriage.
[185.20] Now both of you give her a place in this house with respect
[188.80] otherwise your mother's
[191.96] upbringing will be tarnished. Nothing will happen to me
[194.24] and neither is her place in the house given with respect to the one
[199.60] who is worthy of this respect.
[202.84] First she came to our house with you and
[206.52] then started following our Baba.
[210.40] Maybe this was his intention from the beginning. Repent, do
[213.76] n't blame anyone like this.
[215.72] Use your mind and hand over the house and everything to her
[220.48] and you people finish your studies. Tomorrow you have to get
[224.32] married and leave this house. You people have to
[226.72] please
[227.64] aunty don't worry about us. We don't need anyone.
[233.68] Everything will be fine. You will see to it. And
[238.68] yes, I cannot tolerate the presence of any other woman in this house in place of my mother. Please
[245.96] explain this to your friend also.
[251.16] Only Allah can guide you people.
[254.04] I refrain from speaking in anyone's matter.
[258.36] Such stubborn and harsh girls, how can they do that?
[262.84] I am surprised at what could happen
[271.82] [Sangeet]
[279.04] He has no other work
[281.96] right now Please bring something for him Don't be quiet
[291.94] [Sangeet] I am
[299.63] [Sangeet]
[320.52] Look I have packed all my stuff
[323.36] I thought when you come now that the matter has been revealed I will go
[326.28] home with you
[328.48] Oh Allah I
[330.32] know I went to the parlor too I have
[332.84] come ready Otherwise your eyes would not have fallen on me
[336.16] I thought if you get ready a little better then
[338.36] maybe you will look at me
[341.16] You look very good even in Saki Also
[346.00] leave it ok Tell me all my stuff will
[349.76] come to your house There is space right
[352.48] I have given a lot of stuff to the junk
[354.40] but I have to take some amount with me The
[356.36] truth is that now I do
[360.24] n't feel like staying in this house I
[362.68] just want to stay with you
[369.28] Famida I cannot take you with me right now
[373.68] You will have to stay here for a few more days
[377.60] What do you mean
[382.20] you will not take me to your house
[387.32] Allah
[390.36] look tell me the truth have you
[393.88] thought of leaving me or not
[398.08] Zeba was right in saying about her daughters
[401.88] stubbornness  You would have been swept away like a straw in front of me. Will my
[406.16] desire to settle down in the village
[410.08] remain in my heart? But I have
[413.36] not said so. You assume wrongly about yourself.
[416.28] Try to understand the delicacy of the situation.
[420.92] This is also your house. Your circumstances will
[424.00] always be delicate. But what will happen to me? Have
[427.40] you ever thought? I am also a human being. I
[430.40] also have to face four people.
[433.28] What answer will I give to whom and you are
[437.96] like this. I feel that you are
[442.56] regretting getting married. Just don't talk uselessly.
[444.68] You see, many times things get spoiled in haste.
[450.44] You should be a little patient. And this month,
[453.96] I will also pay the rent of this house. You don't worry at all. There is no
[455.60] need for you to
[457.76] do me a favor. I need money. I am
[460.72] greedy. I cannot take care of myself. There is no
[464.28] need for me to do you a favor. I have been
[466.44] running this house for so long.
[468.64] I will run it further too.
[470.56] If your daughters don't
[473.40] want to see you happy, then what should I
[476.60] do? See, I will take care of whatever I have done.  Do
[481.36] n't worry at all, I will
[489.28] not serve you tea in anger today
[492.49] [Music]
[499.32] Now you, I will unpack the luggage for your tea
[506.64] Well, the luggage has to be unpacked right
[510.07] [Music] I will
[511.84] sit
[515.01] [Music]
[542.88] Now will our brother's father
[544.76] stay with his new bride? What useless things are you talking about Aabi? Let
[547.52] me put him to sleep. He is feeling
[551.12] restless since morning. Poor guy, a strange
[553.84] chemistry has developed between us. If I get upset,
[556.72] he too doesn't get any peace. It is a good
[560.48] misunderstanding. And what wrong thing have I said? I am
[564.20] saying the right thing, brother. Since we have got married, we will
[566.56] stay together. Find out if you have planned a honeymoon
[571.00] Aabi. What nonsense is this? Please Aabi, don't say
[577.04] such things even in jest. I feel very sad.
[579.80] Yes, I feel very happy
[582.22] [Music]
[584.96] No Aabi, we are going on a Pakistan tour.
[588.56] Today the date has been confirmed, so I am excited. It will be a
[591.48] lot of fun.
[592.92] I will be free from this house and the
[595.52] atmosphere here. What do you mean by going?
[598.12] How are you going like this? It is obvious that there are
[602.40] plans for college, it is necessary to go. Have
[605.12] you asked Baba, Baba,
[608.40] which one?  They do their work after asking me. Whatever
[611.08] I ask them, Aabi, there is
[614.08] no comparison between you and Baba and
[617.72] our relationship does
[619.68] not even deserve a competition. Seriously, Aabi,
[621.48] you still care about our relationship.
[624.56] You are very innocent and one
[628.44] day your innocence will harm you a lot.
[630.16] Remember my
[651.92] words. Yes, if there was
[663.56] some work, you could have called me.
[671.88] I have come to talk to you about something very important.
[674.32] Beta, Jiji
[677.52] said, look, it was my heartfelt desire that
[682.48] Momina becomes the daughter-in-law of this house.
[686.52] I wanted you to get a
[692.08] chance to fulfill all the happiness of your life.
[693.84] But beta,
[696.96] I regret to say that
[700.80] I will not be able to fulfill this desire of mine.
[706.52] Why, I mean you went to Abrar uncle.
[710.72] He said something. What did you know?
[714.16] But the person I met
[716.81] [Sangeet]
[717.96] can never be Momina's father.
[721.92] He was the husband of a very hot-tempered woman. I was
[725.92] not against her marriage,
[729.40] rather I was in her favor. Her
[731.08] marriage was necessary.
[733.64] But I did not know that
[736.48] she was going to marry him.  Getting entangled in this affair, he will
[740.84] even forget the respect for our relationship
[743.22] [Music] I do
[745.80] n't know Baba, I only know
[749.36] that Arar uncle did not do the right thing,
[751.48] he did not think about anyone, neither Veer,
[753.52] nor Momina, I do
[755.12] n't know what happened to
[777.84] him [Music] [
[785.26] Music]
[797.20] Now will I have to go to a hotel for breakfast and lunch
[800.23] [Music]
[816.32] I feel very happy when my daughters, who are dearer to me,
[819.64] do a favor to me
[822.77] [Music]
[829.68] Hello, yes, yes,
[833.04] tell me, is it such a big thing, Ra is
[837.40] telling me now, I am coming,

[854.36] fight as well, she is in the hospital

[952.12] made a mockery of my life I am dying because of the pain I
[955.60] cannot stand

[1032.80] only this insult was left to happen Abraaz
[1037.36] sahab  If she was not your beloved daughter, I would have
[1043.84] replied to her words carefully.
[1047.76] Look, I
[1049.52] appreciate your wisdom.
[1052.68] Shagufta has brought her up with great love and care. The
[1056.68] wound is still fresh. Slowly
[1059.92] everything will be healed.
[1062.72] Bringing up with pampering and tantrums does
[1065.40] not mean, Abraaj sahab, that the child becomes arrogant
[1068.12] and forgets to respect his father.
[1071.04] And your child, I also feel something. My
[1081.04] head is hurting so much. I
[1083.48] feel like it will burst any moment.
[1086.20] Listen, please call Jeba and
[1089.96] tell her to make a nice soup. Some soup so that it brings
[1093.44] some life back to my body. I am
[1096.88] capable of taking up the responsibilities of this house. I am
[1099.68] fine. And yes, he will also bring some essential things from the house. As much as you want, don't
[1106.48] bring much. Just bring the essential things. The house will be filled unnecessarily. I
[1109.96] think everything is
[1112.16] present here. Well, it's fine, right? Don't stress your mind right now.
[1115.68] You will feel more pain. Take rest. Everything will be
[1119.76] fine now. Insha Allah.

[1278.12] respect her by putting it on your face, you are like
[1280.88] this, unfortunately I am like this
[1283.96] and if my mother had
[1286.04] taught me manners, then how would a lady like you change that?
[1288.88] Now keep quiet, otherwise no one will be worse than me,
[1294.36] I am quiet, baba, but
[1297.92] let me tell you one thing and that is that if you wake up this aunty
[1302.08] in my mother's room, then I will burn this
[1304.32] house to ashes

[1309.80] can do that, what is the use
[1313.64] and in this way you will only get yourself and mother insulted,

[1339.64] up so easily It

[1351.12] Abir, our house has become a scene

[1442.28] occupied by your daughters By the way,
[1446.84] how did you give birth to such cruel girls?
[1451.88] Look, it will take some time for you to
[1455.80] understand them and for them to accept you
