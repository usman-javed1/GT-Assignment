[188.12] tell the truth these days she had started talking about a lot of sadness on
[192.44] one hand there was a hurry to get her daughter married
[196.40] and on the other hand this was her condition oh so
[199.92] in such a condition what could she talk about happiness these
[202.60] men are very insensitive they consider a woman a child giving

[364.48] told me nothing from her heart she didn't
[368.32] complain she went away
[375.12] Shata didn't do well with me she did
[379.76] n't do well with me have
[383.68] patience my
[386.96] brother sitting here and crying like this won't work

[407.88] how can I
[411.16] go home my daughters do
[416.52] n't even want to talk to me let alone see my face
[422.32] Shata herself has gone away from my life by keeping
[426.44] my daughter away from my life you have to
[430.00] do everything
[434.56] [Music]
[436.76] this is probably the most difficult task of life
[440.48] but still we have to do it
[445.48] we keep our children as per our wish and do
[448.44] n't have the right to die my only mother  She did not die and
[451.20] every relation and every feeling inside me has also
[454.32] died. Amtula aunty knowingly
[457.20] called her to her house and insulted her in front of everyone.
[461.04] She knew that Amma would
[463.64] not be able to bear this shock and in this condition
[465.40] this shock can also take her life. This was
[468.12] not a coincidence, this was a well thought out
[470.88] plan. You have gone mad, what are you
[473.44] saying to
[476.76] me Mamna, it is nothing like this, it is like this. What did
[481.12] I do, what did I spoil,
[483.88] what did I do to them, in revenge for which they have
[486.44] snatched my mother from me.
[494.56] How can someone be so ruthless, so cruel and so base? Stop it,
[498.52] whatever Mamna did was all natural,
[502.40] anyone in her place would have done the same.
[506.32] We hid such a big thing from them.
[509.80] Aunty was also at fault
[510.79] [sangeet], why are
[513.72] you saying such things about my Mama?
[516.20] This is not the time,
[519.44] I have just talked and you are
[524.16] feeling so bad.
[525.52] Because of your Mama's words, my mother
[528.64] lost her life
[529.53] [sangeet]
[532.32] and you don't even want to regret. I have
[535.16] come to you only to regret
[538.20] your sorrow.  Happiness is not separate from me,
[540.80] why don't you understand? The one who
[543.28] gives pain,
[545.88] how can he talk about sharing happiness?
[550.04] Please,
[552.56] Ara, I have started hating the name of love itself
[556.76] [Music]
[563.40] Please, Arham Bhai, leave me alone,
[568.56] forgive me and go away
[570.96] from here. You won't understand my pain, and if
[574.96] I tell you the truth, then you will think that I am
[577.96] crossing my limits, so go away
[580.72] from here and just let me be patient.
[584.20] People's pain is not separate from me,
[587.36] why don't you understand? I don't want to understand this, I don't want to
[589.56] understand anything, please go away
[592.60] from here
[598.12] Sajana
[601.95] [Music]
[604.93] [Laughter]
[606.73] [Music]
[617.36] Your mentality can be so conservative that
[621.96] I can't even imagine what
[625.32] world you live in. If a person is medically fit, he
[628.16] can have a child anytime, and
[630.92] what is shameless in this?
[634.32] In the West, marriage at the age of 40, 50 is a common thing. Oh, the
[638.72] thinking and lifestyle of the West does
[641.28] n't apply here. If she was medically fit, she would have
[644.36] died.
[645.56] Why don't you have any thinking of your own or what
[649.36] you are saying?  You are talking about your mother,
[651.60] at least you
[654.48] should go for condolence and all these old grudges should be
[657.72] forgotten on this occasion. I am
[660.72] not friends with her and
[663.00] I don't know how to give condolences etc. If a person dies, so be it,
[665.80] now sit and cry, how
[668.76] stupid is that. One should be practical
[672.24] but
[674.44] not cruel. If you don't have good manners, then don't
[677.76] go, but don't make fun of someone's grief like this
[685.71] [music]
[692.96] Jawar
[695.60] son,
[697.20] that son, I have heard what you
[701.00] said, you are absolutely right, but son, there are some people for
[705.00] whom words of sympathy and
[707.88] consolation fall short.
[711.16] I want to go there myself, but I am
[714.00] unable to understand
[716.88] how I will be able to face Momna's family. Sania has grown up, the
[719.88] mother has gone, the child is
[724.68] in the hospital, but still you should go there,
[728.08] yes, I want to go there,
[732.96] but you all should also come with me,
[736.28] Mama, please, I become very uncomfortable in such gatherings.
[738.84] Please
[741.48] go with Jawar,
[743.68] aunty.  Don't feel bad, it's your fault, had
[751.32] you taught him even one bit of the social values ​​that you believe in, then I would
[753.84] n't have to see this day
[757.01] [Praise] Have you
[759.84] lost your mind?
[764.64] Try to understand the way you were talking to him, otherwise
[769.04] he will go away from you because of your stupid talks. Then keep
[772.44] sitting and talking. Yes, now I am not
[776.24] happy with marrying him. I don't understand
[779.76] how I should try to understand his mood. [

[860.80] You know
[862.32] these bangles your Baba got
[865.56] made for me when you were born.
[869.28] [Sangeet]
[870.88] You were the biggest happiness of our lives.
[874.56] Baba didn't have such a good job. I don't
[878.80] know how he got them made. Till date,
[882.40] I ask him this. Baba was very romantic. Make
[885.76] fun of your parents. Yes,
[890.44] look, you do one thing - get matching gems embedded in these bangles with
[893.60] your wedding dress.
[895.40] And yes, I have given a
[899.52] bracelet to be made for Abhir. And son,
[905.04] these are two sets, one is this
[910.32] and the other is this.  It is not that heavy, son. Take it
[915.56] after me. Keep it as a memento of your mother
[917.92] [Music]
[920.36] What do you mean by take it, a memento of your mother?
[924.64] What a strange phrase it is. I don't
[927.60] want any memento of my mother, if I want then it is
[931.40] only my mother
[937.36] always, whether there is happiness or
[942.84] trouble, I don't want anything else,
[947.08] Amma, I only want you
[952.00] always, at every turn of life, you understand, don't you?
[964.80] Son, when we are born, then we get all the years of our life written down. We
[969.60] know the first year of our
[974.40] life but we don't know the last year of our life
[977.44] and only Allah knows it.
[983.48] When all the decisions are taken by Allah, then why do
[986.76] we get angry with each other, what happened to
[993.28] you, why are you saying such things, has
[996.24] Baba said anything? He doesn't say anything now, I
[1002.40] keep thinking, may
[1005.72] Allah bring back the happiness in my home
[1010.00] and also the mischief of you both. Now, I
[1015.04] cannot tolerate anyone else in my heart.
[1020.28] You are troubled because of us
[1021.88] [Music]
[1023.60] No, I promise you,
[1026.52] I will make everything absolutely fine.
[1030.92] Just you be happy
[1033.92] [Music] May
[1043.16] Allah keep you happy always and may he make you
[1051.48] wear these bangles on our heads.

[1448.92] both of them also die
[1450.20] What nonsense are you talking about? Why do you call your father and

[1463.12] I do
[1465.96] not understand how Allah created you and

[1469.92] not have any humanity in you right now
[1471.96] aunty this is not right
[1476.12] we should leave. Maybe we should not have come here in the first place. The

[2100.52] anyone says brother I am grateful for this service  Do
[2104.88] n't stop me from doing this If you
[2107.80] get such a protocol after becoming the mother of a son, I would have
[2111.40] prayed for this many years ago So is this a
[2114.88] reward for the acceptance of your prayers I was
[2118.24] thinking that one of my safe files has
[2121.44] come up Now no matter whose file it is, what
[2126.16] difference does it make
[2128.60] How grateful is Allah that he has
[2130.76] blessed us with children at this stage of our lives There
[2134.00] must be some wisdom of his in this
[2140.44] So I think that Momna will get married and
[2143.60] go away So this thought makes my heart nervous
[2146.76] And then Abhir too will leave this house empty
[2151.28] Then it will be you and me and the desolation of this house
[2157.84] Look Allah is closest to the heart He has
[2161.88] heard what you have not even asked for
[2166.72] Just pray that everything goes well
[2172.04] Then the empty feeling of this house will
[2175.12] turn into little laughter For
[2180.36] weeks, I too am yearning for a day Ho Ho Ho When did she
[2188.12] go from this house
[2189.86] [Sangeet] It seems as if
[2194.24] life has also stopped coming and going in my house
