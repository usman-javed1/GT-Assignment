Hara Dil Sajna ve Hara Dil Sajna ve Sajna I don't know how to apply it but it's not coming off friend oh oh what are you doing rubbing a child's eyes like this is very delicate oh god the nails can get infected in fact even before taking him in your lap you should wash your hands properly and just look at this such a dirty towel is a very bad thing you have here at this time oh I suddenly come anywhere at any time by the luck of the children give it to me I will clean it thank you thank you I am very sorry I came suddenly like this I came to Jeba's house then when I called Jeba I came to know that she has gone out for some work she is about to come on the way and my car suddenly broke down I parked it outside your door now if this rain stops then something will happen now your dupatta is getting all wet I will give you Shagufta's sheet and give me this key I will cross the car left or right I am not parked anywhere on the road oh no no don't worry at all the car is Jeba  She is standing outside the door of her house. Let the rain stop and then you will see. You have made my problem easy. Anyway, all these things are in my bag. I have kids but you know that I work in the hospital and the whole day is spent with the kids so I have to keep everything. I will make tea for you. If Shufta were here, I would have taken care of you in a better way. Don't be formal at all, I would be craving for tea, I will tell you myself. What love. You also have two daughters, where are they? Can't you see? Has she gone out? The elder daughter studies in my university. She comes home a little late these days. Poor Abhir was mother's favourite. Ever since Shagufta left, she has kept quiet with her. Don't leave your daughters alone. It's an emotional age and on top of that, this shock. You know, children do any wrong thing when they get emotional. Keep the girls under your watch. I do n't know that Shufta has taken all the happiness of this house with her. Ana, there used to be a lot of joy and happiness.  There was a time in this house, Salam Walekum Walekum Salam I have seen a lot of this grief, sorrow, tears, whose voice is coming, if these things are said, then believe me Baba, it doesn't seem like Seba Aunty's, Baba's son's nanny told me that there is a nurse, Jeba Aunty's best friend and Baba's best friend What is happening in this house, you were not like this after Ammi left, Baba what is Baba's fault in this, we are also habituated, we left the doors of our house open for others, people have a habit, Api, now there is no use in closing the doors, Baba has become addicted to seeking sympathy from people, he would be sitting in front of everyone and telling that their daughters are angry with them, since when has she been coming, this is Seba Aunty's friend, I don't know, Kaser has come and told me the whole story, that too is a moving drama, I do n't know what all she would be talking about us while sitting in front of people, I will go and see [Music], that's enough, a person goes away and memories are a cruel thing, they find a place in every corner of the house  I would have made a promise and sat down but I say that she is very lucky who is still living in your heart and this house. This relationship is such that if there is no place in the heart, I think even the biggest luxurious houses start looking desolate. Shagufta supported me in my bad times and I have spent good times with her too. But if Abraj sahab keeps remembering the old things, how will new happiness be seen? I have seen you a lot of sorrow, pain and tears. Now when such things happen, believe me, the heart starts getting nervous and the health gets worse. Assalam waaleikum waaleikum asalam. Sorry baba, I am a little late. You must not have asked the guest for tea. Momna, this is Fahmi [sangeet]. Now, there is Woba aunty, isn't she her friend. This hospital is for children. There is a lot of healing in her hands. Our Sami gets completely fine as soon as we go to her. Oh, let it be, just see how beautiful she is. Brother, I was very keen to meet you. I have heard a lot of praises of you. Let's rain today.  We have met outside, hey, if you want to sit here, then come and sit next to me, your father did not tell me properly who I am, I will tell you, she is your Zeba aunty, actually she used to live in our neighborhood and then I had also done my nursing course with her, so there was a bit of a senior-junior thing, but don't tell her in front of her that she was senior to me, she gets angry immediately on every thing, by the way Abrar sahab, she is such a beautiful girl, has her marriage been fixed or not, may Allah grant her heaven, her mother had fixed it in her lifetime itself, that's good, Mashallah, this is a very good thing, look, I have so many things to think about her in just one minute, you have some tea, I will go and prepare dinner, you will go after eating, oh no, no son, don't be formal at all, I have to reach the hospital, your Zeba aunty is waiting for her, when she will come, I will go with her, stay happy, very sweet girl, sahab, Mashallah, what a wonderful upbringing you have given to the child [Music] [Music] Thank you [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hey, why are you calling me again and again? There is no use in repeating anything. It will waste my time and your energy. Shut up mam, listen to me and don't disconnect the call. I want to meet you. I am coming home right now. I don't need any excuse. Understand? It's very strange. She does n't want to meet you and you are going crazy for her. You haven't come out of the drama of NC yet. I feel like leaving her to her own devices. Move on, rest, do you go back to your home? I mean your own home where you are only interested in your life. Don't interfere in anyone else's life. [Music] Hey, what are you doing? Will you leave the house just because Arham says so? Keep all this back. So, it's not like this is my home. I am leaving your and Arham's house and until my house is built, I will stay in a hotel. I ca n't stay here to be insulted.  She repeatedly threatens to leave the house, one day these threats fall on her own people, I am already tired of Arham's dramas, don't create any new drama, you have fed up with Arham a lot, he scolds me whenever he wants, but you will not say anything to him, everything I say will seem like a drama to you, what has happened, put all this back, stupid girl, I don't know when you will come to your senses, stupid, it's not me, it's you, in what tone are you talking to me, I am your mother, you are not my mother, beware, if you use this tone again, he would say something, how insulted you were by those people there, but neither did their friendship end, nor is Aram going to leave her, he will leave her very soon, believe me, how can you believe so much, he has just gone to meet her, I am not stupid like you, you see Momna, you will never marry Arham, are you dreaming about Fiza, your interest in someone's coming and going is without any reason  So it can't be possible Mama she is Jwar's sister and Jwar is very emotional about his sister ok now leave all these things and listen to me carefully Aram can do anything for your happiness keep all this [Music] [Music] take it back Fai Allah what was the need to do all this oh what did I do ok be grateful for this rain and what about me I took you on a tour of Abrar bhai's house ok did my words come to your mind or did you hear it with one ear and let it out from the other as it has always been your habit ah you know that my mind is always disturbed and I listen to other people's words with one ear and let it out from the other you crazy this is of use to you ok you have seen Abrar bhai's house from inside how big it is and the most important thing is that it is your own house neither worry about rent nor about expenses see even with two jobs you will be saved you are right your Abrar bhai is very nice but his daughters are very smart they are full of energy and these are baba's ladli daughters  She never tolerates another woman, she will not agree, now Ra sahab should get married, by the way, tell me one thing, why are both these girls sitting at home till now, they should have had their own homes by now, see Mamna was getting married, her in- laws created such a hurry, Shagufta died half in this grief, then she passed away, so the matter cooled down [sangeet] it would have been better if both of them had got married, they will get married, and anyway, who makes young girls sit at home for so long, as far as the question is about the child, he will be yours forever, now in this time, there is no possibility of you having a child, why can't I give birth to a child, when your neighbor can give birth to a child at this age, then what is my fault, she must be at least 20 years older than me, she can give birth to a child, well, I am a little scared na Jeba, that I might get trapped after getting married, looking after every house, looking after the children, looking after the house, I cannot do all this, freedom has its own fun, see, funny, there comes an age that  When we do n't need a man's company but his support [Praise] [Music] Should I get married? Yes, yes, get married. Now you see how much Abrar Bhai respects his wife. He will sit on his head in respect to you. May Allah bless you with the samosa. You eat the samosa I had ordered for you. [Music] I know you all are very angry with me [Music] But son, remember one thing. All our intentions are fulfilled only when Allah's will is involved. [ Music] Aasha Ufta is not with me [Music] But her happiness, her dreams are with me, right? [Music] If I complete her unfinished work, then she will also get peace, right? Uncle, I am with you. I have already said sorry on Mama's behalf. I want to apologize once again [Music] Uncle, Momina is living very lonely. I want to make her happy. I can't make this promise to myself. Please talk to Momina and leave her alone. [Music] The one who has gone once, doesn't come back [Music] But the happiness that we have  It is in our fate at least she should not go out of our hands [Music] no, you please talk to her once [Music] [Music] [Music] where is the phone [Music] and call again hello yes yes yes I am speaking I am speaking I am speaking yes yes I can come I can definitely come it will take 40-45 minutes there is a lot of traffic on the way yes yes okay okay I am coming Aha friend Sami there was a call from the office pray that there is some good news for your father ok you take me here comfortably your maid is coming I get ready you don't have to cry ok just now [Music] I have come [Music] it's late it's late I'm going Sami I am going for a little while I will come just now my love your maid has not come yet friend call the maid she will come just now don't bother her just go I will call her I will come in a little while I ask I call and ask wait wait wait wait hey where are you [Music] ya yes okay  ok ok she is coming her phone is going off friend what should I do abhiir son I was saying that if you would have taken leave from college today then chairman sahab called me her maid has not come till now it is very very important for me to go to office a lot of loss has already happened son he has called me today also god knows what is the matter my going to college is also important now why do you force me to vent out all my anger on you [sangeet] don't bring her here take her inside I don't like this at all what kind of a sister are you how long will I keep putting her in front of strangers I have heard that blood turns white [sangeet] but I don't know that she will have to see her in her own house [sangeet] your son's maid has come ok thank god today your anger has been saved he has come it is his job he had to come but you must have fulfilled your duties as a sister if you get time then think on this [ sangeet] let's travel for a minute I am coming salam waaleikum jaba sister tell me that she has not come to you with the maid I have been back from office since long but at home  But there is no one, no, oh brother, no one has come here, both of them were at home, I have just come from there a while ago, Sunny was sleeping and Kausar was watching TV, the fitter was also very dirty, I have scolded Sami and come now, you have called Kausar, she might have taken Sami out, she is very fond of roaming around, I did not call you, you come with me, yes, I will come, I will come wearing a sheet, okay, I am coming [Music], she is not even picking the phone, or may Allah come, sister Zeba, quickly [Music] [Praise] [Music] We searched a lot but could not find her anywhere, but I am surprised that how did you keep a maid for such a small child without any investigation, that child is speechless, I cannot tell anything, what could I do, my helplessness, Abrar should also not be worried, I have told Azam and have gone to find out the address of Kausar's house, she must be coming, aunty ji, ch ch ch [Music] [Music] Let's go, listen, Salam Walekum ji, this is locked, where have these people gone here, oh brother, his stuff was brought in the morning  She left just a little while ago, she took away their child, this is a great injustice, why don't you do this, her husband is a driver in some bungalow in the neighborhood, find out from him, this is all we know, what is her husband, she was saying that she is a widow and she has small children, sister, her husband earns a lot, go ahead and find out, he works as a driver, I think Abraaj sahab, we should go to the police station immediately, a lot of time has been wasted here, oh God, where will I find my child now, the police will do something, now you go to the police station, help [music], you take leave, it was not so important for you to go to college, your regular classes are not being held these days, so what was the issue, you know what the situation is inside Baba's office, what the situation is, he has been fired from his job, we both have to together give him relief from home, it is a compulsion and but that child, Aapi, please friend, I have no interest in living a helpless life like you, my studies and my college  It is more important than that child and you are very fond of raising this beloved child of Baba, right? So raise it and leave your university. You have become extremely rude. Now you are not rude, I have become sensible. I have gained wisdom. Life cannot be spent being emotional. And when every person decides to be happy, then he does not give attention to anyone. And then he should bear the burden of his decisions himself. Be happy, both of you have gone. Sami was a burden, I have borne it for both of you. No one else will trouble you both. Go, go, well done Abhir. Take rest. No one will cry. Baba, what are you saying in this house? How can Kausar do this? She had been coming here for so many days. It is obvious that when she saw that she has no heir, no one will cry for her, she found an opportunity and took him away. She does not know in which cruel person's hands my poor Sami must be. Go, go, celebrate. Go, Papa, there is a bad news. What happened? He is Abrar uncle's son kidnapped.  It has happened, they had hired a maid, she has taken her and disappeared, how did you get to know about it? I received the call, you were getting calls on your cell phone, I received it, now it was Rara uncle's call, he is an amazing man, what was the need to keep such a maid, friend, someone keeps creating trouble 24 hours a day and all these troubles come to our house without any effort, I don't understand when will we be free from these people [Sangeet] We will have to go son, it's okay, thank you, thank you so much [Sangeet] Even if the police want to do something, what ca n't they do, they have arrested your maid's husband and Inshallah your son will recover very soon, let's go to the police station, let's go to the police station, at least eat something, friend, look what you have done, I have never seen you so troubled in my life, friend, eat something, let's go to the police station, friend, eat something, first I am getting very tensed [Sangeet] Those people have harmed Sami, may Allah grant that he is fine, Inshallah, if Allah wishes, everything will be fine [Music] It must be your mistake too, right? Without thinking, you kept a woman in the house about whom you had no information You people have done this Baba did not know we should have found out about this Or you people also live in this house [Music] There was so much happiness in aunty's life, there was so much peace Arham Bhai, the happiness and peace of this house, all got ruined because of this child The last spectacle was yet to come and that too the whole world has seen What are you saying, what has that child spoiled for you That child is your brother You cannot change this truth, this child has spoiled everything Baba, Nami would have lost her life thinking of bringing him into this world Here everyone cares about their own happiness It is better if you do not talk on this topic [Music] It is Fahmi, just pray that Allah brings good news Abrar Bhai went to the police station The ill-fated woman was not the mother of the children, this was her only job Well, by the way, tell me why is your Abrar Bhai so simple  Or did he make some mistake, what nonsense have I been talking to you for so many days, he is a very decent man, he does n't know the high and low of today's times, may Allah grant him heaven, it was he who took care of Shagufta at home, otherwise she is Allah Miya's cow, well should I call him Allah Miya's bull, by the way, I have also started to sympathize a little with your Abrar bhai, now it is obvious that if he is sad, then I too won't be able to sleep tonight, right? By the way, you supported him a lot, I was thanking you, hey, what are you thankful for, now your Abrar bhai is our own, well, it's okay, there is no need to make a lot of fun, that sahab was looking a bit too close to Abraaj sahab and his son also seems to be a very sexy party, tell me from where did you get trapped, hey, he is Momna's future father-in-law, he is a very nice man, he takes a lot of care of Mamna, it's just that his wife's mind doesn't match, she is a very bad-minded woman, he should be, bad-minded brother, it is right to be proud, Allah has given him so much, well  Come on, leave it, you take care of yourself. Yes, we will talk a lot tomorrow. Come on, I will also go to sleep. Allah [Music] [Music] Hafiz, you have been creating a ruckus since long. Come on [Music] [Music] Mu, what have you done son? I never even looked at you harshly and [ Music] you could not take care of an innocent life. [Music] I always kept you like a flower and what did you do that my time is in the dilemma between life and death? What have you done son? [Music] How have you treated me? There was definitely something lacking in my love [Music] When you people left loving Nemi far away [Music] you did not even take care of him considering him a human being [Music] Hum sam sam my brother, I am sorry
