[28.96] Sajna
[34.92] taalia Pink eyes when I saw you, my
[40.72] heart has become drunk, take care of me, O my friends, it has become difficult to control
[61.12] myself La
[67.44] lala lalala la la la lala lala Why are
[76.12] you so quiet
[79.20] Your eyes and your
[82.32] face are not supporting your silence like this
[85.55] [Music]
[86.84] Why am I not quiet I am talking to everyone
[90.32] and since when have you started talking about my face and my
[93.44] eyes Ever since
[94.48] we came here I have been
[98.24] looking at your face and
[100.36] reading your eyes
[101.68] Funny we have come here in just a few hours
[105.84] [Music] So
[112.32] what difference does it make There are some people of
[115.72] such a type with whom you
[117.52] meet once and decide that you should meet them
[119.40] again and again
[123.24] We talk well, I mean I only
[127.20] talk well I am not a good person myself, don't
[128.96] know I haven't thought so much I mean I have
[132.32] never looked at you so carefully, so
[135.00] look, think, you have enough time
[138.68] Hey, is there any compulsion  If I don't
[142.12] think about it then it cannot happen that
[145.52] you don't
[147.60] think about me You are challenging me No, I am
[150.60] not challenging me, I don't have any idea,
[152.76] my Faraz please listen to me once, neither am
[156.60] I passing time with you
[159.08] nor do I have any
[160.72] intention to flood you Now if these two things are removed then
[164.36] only friendship remains between two people, is
[166.04] n't it? Is there any problem in that too? How are
[169.48] you doing like this Faraz,
[172.16] how can you think so much in one meeting? Yes, I mean
[175.16] I have thought about it, you can also think about it, but
[177.68] keep one thing in mind,
[180.80] I am not used to hearing no,
[186.92] this also happens,
[189.16] wow Abir, your
[193.48] [sangeet]
[208.68] luck [
[210.63] sangeet]
[219.56] you know
[220.26] [sangeet]
[223.16] Baba was angry with Abhi
[229.24] and left this world in anger
[232.23] [sangeet]
[241.04] He did
[243.96] not give her a chance to convince him, he kept on
[258.68] going like this I called Abhi many times, she is
[264.64] very unlucky
[267.03] [sangeet] she did
[270.32] not
[273.64] pick up even a single phone She could not even see Baba for the last time
[277.52] [sangeet] She must be
[281.20] thinking of excuses, she must be
[285.48] thinking
[290.12] what will she say to Baba when she returns
[292.36] [Music]
[297.32] What does she know? There is
[307.00] no one here to listen to her excuses, to listen to her stories.
[307.90] [Music] There is no one left to
[315.64] scold her. No one will be there
[326.52] now. Ami will ask Baba, on
[338.12] whose support did he leave his daughters at such a young age?
[342.68] Who is there after them?
[345.10] [Music]
[347.12] We have no one.
[355.08] Look, I am standing alone,
[360.04] I have no one.
[367.29] [Music] Why did you people leave me alone and go away? [Music]
[371.08] What will I do in this house? I have no
[377.24] one with me. No
[381.92] one, neither
[387.80] you nor me.
[389.97] [Music]
[402.25] [Music]
[418.40] Baba
[424.28] [Prashan]
[426.00] Ala ja,
[428.40] what has happened? If I got two minutes of sleep, it would have been a
[431.80] disaster. I am
[438.24] awake the whole day and night. Now, when I fell asleep a
[442.00] little, the boy started getting quiet. What are you people
[444.44] talking about? The kind of
[447.20] things I should have talked about earlier. It hasn't been a day since
[449.76] my husband died. I have become a
[451.56] widow now and I am feeling very bad about my sleep.
[454.00] I have
[455.84] no concern with your sleep. But if you let Sami
[457.88] sleep with you,  If you had taken him then you can take care of him too, if the
[459.48] children's head gets hurt, it
[462.40] might affect their brain, all the intelligent people have been
[464.68] born in my fate, I am the only
[467.00] mad person left here, listen to me,
[469.28] wife, pick him up and take care of him yourself, have you understood,
[472.00] otherwise if something happens to Kara tomorrow, you will
[474.00] say that aunty poisoned him and killed him, I will not
[476.64] raise someone else's child, I don't know if he is
[479.32] your brother or
[481.05] [Music]
[488.08] Son, what are you saying, I am saying the same thing
[492.08] which I should have said a long time ago, take this, hold
[494.28] all his stuff, his father has died, I have
[497.28] understood, I will not raise his headache, now I don't
[499.52] need him, take
[501.92] this, the milk box, Baba, everyone, do
[505.00] n't come to my room to take anything, get out of here,
[507.56] go out of my room and now if I
[509.76] see you and this child in my room
[511.84] then look at me, you don't
[515.28] let me see, you have ruined my [Music]
[538.20] my [
[550.85] Music] [Music] [Music] [
[565.18] Music] [Praise] [Music] [Praise] [Music]
[588.04] [Music]
[592.12] I was thinking that you would
[594.48] wait for me for tea  You are not used to waiting,
[597.20] this is a very good thing, this
[600.52] shows that you have a lot of similar habits as mine, will you marry
[604.56] me,
[613.32] Faraz, are you joking, I am serious,
[618.52] look, after I leave from here, I will send my mother to
[621.40] your house, they will then
[624.28] fix the date of marriage, do you have any objection?
[628.04] Today, you do not even know me or my family,
[631.16] we have met on a tour and this is not such a
[635.32] big decision, you tell me
[637.80] what do you know about me, nothing and
[641.44] you said such a big thing, I like you, that is
[643.92] enough for me and listen, I have a lot of
[648.52] friends and I don't know why, I don't feel like getting married
[655.36] and I feel yes, look at what a
[658.76] nice smile
[660.20] you have, I promise you, I will keep you
[662.92] very happy, there
[668.92] is a lot of difference, where did the topic of our class
[672.36] come in between
[673.74] [sangeet],
[675.36] anyway, I did not come to your house,
[679.16] you came to my house
[680.04] [sangeet]
[682.08] and your parents, my mother, she is
[686.92] a business woman and has very liberal thoughts,
[689.72] she divorced my dad only
[692.08] because both of them felt that
[694.00] he  People cannot be happy and when it came to
[696.52] my custody, I preferred to
[698.96] live with my mother and your
[702.20] father, he lives in England and is
[706.08] very happy with his wife and children and the infact
[709.44] point is that we all are happy in our own worlds.
[712.36] If your mother has
[714.56] any problem with my family, then first of all it will
[717.40] not happen and even if it happens, it does not
[720.88] matter to me. I am a thief, I am
[723.44] established, I do
[725.60] not need anyone's permission for my marriage, but if
[727.80] I do not accept your proposal,
[729.52] then yes this is a very
[733.36] important point,
[735.00] I did not even think about it that what will happen if you reject it,
[737.28] what will happen, by the way, you will
[740.68] wake up from sleep at night and will remember me,
[743.44] after all I am not a piece of cake
[747.12] that you can ignore me so easily,
[748.64] send your mother to my house, then we will see
[751.56] who cries in whose memory, oh really,
[754.96] who all are there in your house, in
[761.20] my house
[763.19] [sangeet] there is
[765.08] no mother, there is an
[768.08] elder sister,
[773.08] Mamna, younger brother
[775.56] and  Baba is here, this is
[780.64] my family,
[784.08] Baba was not happy when I came here
[788.32] without his permission, he will be
[792.72] very angry with me
[795.60] and now you are thinking
[798.56] that what will happen if you go back,
[802.48] you have fulfilled your stubbornness
[805.72] but still there is guilt in your heart,
[810.48] you are right, I should not have come here,
[815.92] but when Baba refused to come here, I
[818.52] thought that this is the right thing, so no problem,
[822.60] I will come with you,
[824.40] talk to your Baba, you will talk to my Baba,
[827.04] no they will kill both of us
[829.88] and they will think that I was
[831.92] trying to come here because of you and
[834.12] they will not believe that we are
[836.04] meeting for the first time,
[839.56] when I am ready to take the responsibility of his stubborn daughter for the
[841.12] whole life,
[843.08] then they will be happy to hear this,
[846.04] Baba will never be happy with me, I
[849.80] know this, nothing like this is going to happen,
[855.04] you go and say a small sorry to him
[859.32] and use the magic of sorry,
[862.44] then tell me what
[867.68] happened
[869.42] [Sangeet]
[888.71] [Sangeet]
[896.26] [Sangeet]
[897.68] went
[904.05] [Sangeet]
[923.28] itself also
[926.48] happened but this girl did not come back home
[932.69] [Sangeet] I do
[935.72] n't know whether she will come or not  Will she not come back
[940.12] or will she elope with someone else from there?
[943.00] Why are you asking me all this?
[945.72] This is a matter of your family. You should know. I am
[949.00] asking you
[951.76] because Nayla is Abir's friend.
[956.12] But look sir, did Nayla go
[961.24] with her college friends? If Abir
[970.08] left the house despite her father's refusal?
[973.80] I have not given my Nayla the hope
[978.56] that she should have relations with anyone and
[981.72] she does not have any friendship with that Khusra girl. Have
[983.80] you ever seen
[986.48] Nayla coming or going here? She is a
[992.44] very rude and ill-mannered girl.
[996.84] I am afraid that if she comes back, I do
[1001.08] n't know what a big drama she will create. May
[1004.04] Allah come back, otherwise we will read about her
[1008.96] too. She must have
[1011.12] eloped
[1014.28] with someone. By the way, only Allah is the protector of this house.
[1018.68] Hey, why is Allah the protector of this house, brother?
[1021.44] What should I give in dying? Now after the marriage of the husband, the whole
[1026.92] house is mine. After all, I am a widow. Now,
[1031.92] what have you talked about on this occasion? Read
[1035.52] all the women.  She is looking at our face, the
[1125.20] Quran is kept for Ammi
[1129.94] [Music]
[1135.08] Hammy's Quran is not to be kept, it is

[1735.28] Tell me what did the police say. What will the
[1740.04] police say?
[1742.80] If they find any clue, they will tell us.
[1747.92] And if they don't find it, then this case
[1752.00] file will just lie there
[1754.48] in a corner. No
[1758.24] one will
[1762.52] ask. This won't
[1765.60] happen.
[1769.24] What are you going to do?
[1770.84] Please, for God's sake, don't do anything. It's
[1779.80] only you. I have
[1782.40] already heard so much because of you.
[1785.24] So much has come. I don't have the courage. Please, no
[1787.88] one's father has the courage to
[1790.32] say anything. It was Baba because of whom I used to tolerate these deceitful
[1793.92] people. Now you see,
