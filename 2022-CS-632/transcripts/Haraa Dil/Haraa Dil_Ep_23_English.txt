Why are you crying? [Music] Friend, let me talk to Momna. Yes, mother, son, there is nothing to worry about. Look, that person has escaped from jail. The police must be after him and he will be caught again, if not today, then tomorrow. Be patient, son, trials come from Allah and we should face these trials with great courage. Do n't worry, everything will be fine. What will happen now? [Music] You have heard it. If you want to know the details, then turn on any news channel and watch it. Afan sahab, I have to talk to you about something important. If you get free from the issues of outsiders, then worry about your family and your children too. I will talk to you on a phone call. Hello, now what is this childishness? Look, you will be late. You have scattered everything. Come, hurry up, otherwise it will be late. I don't want to become a bride. I don't want to become a bride. I want to go anywhere. I feel like if he comes in front of me and I kill him. How can the police let him escape? How can there be such irresponsibility?  Aapka apna hai aapka karte hain koi hai aapka ... If Sam is in the lap of his family even for a short while, I start feeling uneasy. The time is very short right now. I understand your concern about him, but there is no comparison between Arham Bhai and Aarat. You should see that one day he will go psycho because of both of them. He is a bad thing. He is my mother and your mother-in-law. May Allah have mercy on you. May you just see that day when he accepts you as his daughter-in-law. [Sangeet] And we had promised to stay here till your marriage. Today is the last day of that promise. [Sangeet] And I don't have any good hopes. [Sangeet] He loves you a lot and will never cheat you. Respect him. A mother's love always wins. I cannot deny this fact either. [Sangeet] Stop it, Afan. Stop it. Now that Israr has given his answer, he has made my children's lives hell. If you still don't realize this, then when will you realize it? Our children, our children Areej and Arham are our children. But maybe you have forgotten about other people's children.  If you get free from your issues, then think what all has happened to you. I know very well what all has happened to me. My son's house could not be settled. My daughter has been divorced because she is not happy with her husband or her husband is not happy with her. And do you know why everything is happening? All this is because of you. Whatever happens in this house, you are not responsible for it. Your friendship with Araj never strikes. The wind never strikes in velvet. You have seen the result. Your son is leaving the comfort of his home and wasting his time there. All this is a fuss of your mind and until this fuss ends, this house can never be settled. If Arham had married Fiza, then Areez would never have got divorced today. And if you had let Areez go with Jwar, then she too would never have got divorced. This is a lie, nonsense. She never loved Areez. You are extremely selfish. You have not allowed your daughter's house to be settled till date. She is yours.  I was happy with my husband but you did not like his happiness You always created distances in his path And if you could blame me for all the faults, you put them on my account All these faults are yours and will always be on your account Whatever I have done, I have done it for the peace of Aarish He was not some man from London who would bring all the happiness and give it to him Happiness comes with peace of mind If happiness came from a big house, you would not be asking for a divorce from me today We would be living a peaceful life in this house [Sangeet] [Sangeet] Hey, tell me when will I be happy When I will send you off as a bride with Aaram Bhai To that house where only you and Aaram Bhai live Have you gone mad, will I not become a bride again and again I know your tone is exactly like Aarim's [Sangeet] And I wish Aarim was here today She would have taught me a lesson She would have told me not to sit like this, don't talk like that Don't eat like that [Sangeet] Do n't blame me for that work This will keep on being a lesson Ma [Music] So mother, whatever you said, for me and Sami, you are our mother. You and Sami never let you feel that you are a newly-wed bride. It is not like that. What did I say to you? A woman is a natural mother. All other beings make a place in us to be blessed in that one season. It is our thinking. Aah, the age of bringing up the newly-wed hearts, keep me with you always. May Allah keep you happy like this always. [Music] What do you mean, how will I tell you? [ Music] I will not be with me. [Music] [Music] [Praise] [Music] Whose number is it that will you come? Hello, hello, yes, I am calling from Khala, I am here. You want to meet me. Tell me quickly. I have very little time, damn it, where are you. Which was that unlucky moment when I took up the contract of bringing you up. May Allah grant that you die and even your dead body is not found. Stop this drama Khala and tell me where are you. Where are you? Tell me, I will call the police right now and send them. Tell me, if you do n't, Khala, I will tell you.  I will take your life, go away, I am afraid of you killing me, it is better if you kill me, then I will be spared from a Manu like you, listen to me, aunt, tell me where are you, otherwise I will come to your house, I do n't want to meet you, go and do whatever you want to do, today is Abir's wedding, I am very busy, I don't have time, wow, first Momna's wedding and now Abir's, listen to me carefully, aunt, I have very little time, explain to your daughters that they should take back my case and go to the court and sign the settlement, aunt, I have come out, aunt and the police will come to catch me, I will make your life miserable, aunt, what do you think, I am Bhaktiyog of these jackals of yours, I am aunt, I don't know you, you listen to me now, do whatever you want to do, I am telling you, you will get punished for the crimes you have committed, and yes, even if these girls forgive you, I will not forgive the murder of my husband, get out of my life and I called you. Otherwise I will tell you if you don't agree properly [Music] La what happened Femi [Music] Aunty whose call was it Who were you talking to was it Kass's call Kass [Music] He doesn't have that much courage No, I have told him repeatedly that he will not call again What was he saying here, he wants both of you sisters to forgive him and take back the case [Music] And if you don't forgive him, then there's no need to forgive him, no case will be taken back He will be punished for the crime he has committed And when the wound becomes a sore, it should be cut and thrown away, this is what I have learnt La will help us, Inshallah you don't worry, look, today is Zar's marriage, if you get worried, then who will take care of him And I am here, I will take care of everything, you just go happily [Music] [Music] S Begum Sahiba Begum what has happened to Aariz Bibi What has happened to Aariz, Aariz Bibi is lying unconscious in her room When I went with tea, I saw that she was unconscious What should I do, how many times should I explain to this girl  No one dares to listen to me. He has made divorce a disease for himself. Now you call me and tell him that we are taking the patient to the hospital, she has fainted, but that Begum Sahiba should do what he said. Do it from my phone. [Music] S Hello Arham Sahab, this is absolutely right. It is my vaccine. The outline is looking good, right? While taking the vaccine out. [Music] And O Allah, where did my vaccine go? It was kept here. It is possible that you forgot the vaccine at home. Call and check. [Music] Yes, are you ready? Now do n't worry and I will come to pick you up. Yes friend, you are also ready, but there is one problem. I have kept it at home. What do you do? Look carefully. I have kept it myself. Check it with your own hands. I have checked in all the stuff here and there. I am not able to find it. You do one thing, look in the room or under the bed. In anger, I had thrown things here and there, so maybe somewhere, oh Allah, what should I do now? You are not doing one thing of yours properly, sister, please throw Arham Bhai out of the house quickly or else  Send his driver, I will wait and I will get a simple hairstyle done. Ok, I will find it. You wait. Be patient. Ok, I am waiting. What should I do? [Music] Yaar, I got a call from home. Aari ji's health is very bad. Dad is also not at home. So, Mumma is taking him to the hospital alone. You should be with Aarij. You do one thing. He should go to the hospital. It is important for me to stay here. But we still have time. You can go. We just have to go to the hotel and then pick up Abhir. I will do that. Just manage it. I will manage it. You should be with aunty at this time. If you are with Aarij, I will also be at peace. When the baraat starts leaving from the house, I will inform you. You can come directly to the hotel. Okay, then you take the driver and the car. Otherwise, you may need the car. I will take care of it. Listen, the car is mine and I pay the driver's salary too. Mumma doesn't.
