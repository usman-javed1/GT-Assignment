Haara dil sajna ve Haara dil sajna ve [Music] Sajna [Music] Here I am, by the way, very rarely am I kind, don't expect too much from anyone I have already given you the money because you have come home, but this is the last time, yes, okay, okay, she is getting a divorce very soon and it is your job to get it signed, this time I do n't want any manipulation, do you understand, no, no, nothing will happen, it will happen the way it is, let's go, thank you [ Music] Come on, let me drop it, ji [Music] Thank you Momina, I am talking to you, I want to hear the truth, the absolute truth, was Mumma going to get you and Kas married, was there any planning, and did you know about this, your mother told you, you didn't tell me, Momina, I am asking you, tell me, what is the use of all these things, after what I have heard from there, all these things have no value, I want an answer to my question, if I get the answer, then why are you asking me [ Music] Yes, whatever happened, happened, I want to forget all that  I want you to forget [sangeet] it's my mistake I should never have said yes to that marriage [sangeet] and then I shouldn't have gone to that house with you even after that I had hoped from aunty that she will forgive me and give me a place in that big house even though it was small because of your relationship [sangeet] this didn't happen and neither is there any possibility of it happening it's better this [sangeet] that we end it forever how easy it is for you to end this relationship every time [sangeet] I have no value for you I have a lot of value what else is there in my life except you this is my truth Amtula aunty will never understand you were the only one who resided in my empty eyes you were my wish and desire you were my prayer in the mind of relationships false stories are not easy O God I have forgotten the memories my heart is lost my love my love my love my love my love I know at this moment this thing will sound very bitter You should support your husband in every situation. Don't ruin your home by getting influenced by his mother. I am telling you the truth. His mother seems crazy to me. She is stupid and arrogant. If such a woman becomes a mother, then she should be praised by Allah. Otherwise, such a woman is not capable of becoming a mother. Please keep quiet. I did not ask you for advice. I cannot even give advice. I can only curse her. He is a good boy. Don't ruin your home by thinking about his mother. And what will you lose if he himself becomes a shield and stands in front of his mother to become your support. Look [Music] I don't have any explanation for this [Music] I want a divorce from Papa. Do whatever you want to do. Now, whether you are there or not, it does n't matter to me. What is the respect of a mother and the love of a mother? I have forgotten everything. What nonsense are you talking about? You are saying the truth. I am saying the truth. And along with that, listen to my last words. I don't want to stay in this house. I am leaving this house and your life as well. You cannot tolerate Momina in this house.  I am going alone in this house, son. Listen to me, baba. Please don't ask me to stay. I don't want to stay in this house where my uncle's pride and his attitude lives. I'm sorry, leave me in this condition. Please take care of yourself, son. [Music] You are going to meet your wife. I am not bound to answer you. Wait, wait, you have to listen to me. What do you want to say? You are going to take Mamna. Okay, bring her, although she went from here on her own. I also did not ask her to leave from here without your permission. Well, you don't find any of her mistakes wrong. Go and bring her, but that child will not come here with her. A small orphan child cannot be cared for in my house. I am feeling sorry for your thinking today. The charity dramas that you keep doing every day, stop it. A small child will make your life difficult. Listen to me. It's not so easy to raise someone else's child. Wait, Khuda [Music] [Music] Hafiz, you have gone away, I am helpless, how can I do this?  dard baya reza reza sab khwaap hue chham chham barse pyaasi [praise] akhia haara dil alag kar sa nothing happened to you both you tried your best but see you yourself had told me to get fahmi kasi and momna married saajna haara dil saajna after that all these things have no status I want an answer to my question if I got the answer then why are you asking me saaj tell ghulam din to take out the car I have to go mumma where are you going behind aram mumma what happened you will now go to momna's house he must have gone there and where else can he go aunty areez is saying absolutely right where should you go at this time behind aram you just relax now what do you both want that I should not go after my son let him go to momna I ca n't do this I can't let him go there I have to stop him how do you stop him he did n't listen to you here he will listen to you there at momina's house it doesn't matter to him whether your house is bad or dad's health is good  Aunty, please don't think about all this right now, we will talk calmly in the morning, yes, I promise you, everything will be fine in the morning. Now let's go there, Sajna, I should not have said yes to that marriage [Music] and I should not have gone to that house with you, Sajna [Praise] [Music] Jad [Laughter] [Music] Mumma, you are sleeping here, no, no, you go and sleep, Mumma, why are you taking so much tension, I told you, go and sleep, don't bother me [Music] I want to hear [Music] hello, yes, I am speaking, yes, my son, why, what happened, are you well, what happened [Music] yes, yes, my son, what happened, Bir Aunty, Arham Bhai met with an accident [Music] [Praise] [Music] aa [Music] [Music] aa [Music] you are only responsible for my son's accident, because of you, only because of you, my son has to reach this condition, do you know what it means to be a mother, the look on the face of a mother whose son is lying in this condition,  There is no pride, there is laughter, there is prayer, there is worry, there are no accusations It is very easy to become a mother Aunty, but to become a mother one has to sacrifice oneself A mother can sacrifice her life for her son if she wants, but for that a woman must have this beautiful passion [Music] [ Praise] [Music] [ Praise] [Music] Fine [Music] [Praise] [Music] Get well I get well [Music] go [ Music] [ Praise] [Music] Nothing [Music] will happen to me He is my only brother, I have only one brother You were there in my empty eyes, you were my wish, you were my prayer The value of relationships is all false stories, it is not easy God, you have forgotten the memories, you just pray, see everything will be fine Aapi Aram Bhai has regained consciousness and he took your name as soon as he woke up, go and meet him [Music] True [Music] [Music] Ch [Music ] [ Music] [ Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i [Music] And what have you done [Music] Sajna, I think I shouldn't have come here I am with you, you should have realized your status and position by now Mama, I think you should also leave, take some rest and then you are thinking absolutely right, you should also go home, you people need not worry about Aram, didn't you people see how relaxed he has become as soon as Momna came, you cannot remain silent, I have been silent since morning, now maybe you should not feel even a bit of shame Momina, about Aram, marriage is made in heaven, maybe this is what is called, you people should also accept this truth, what has happened, you are just a little worried because of Arham and nothing else, if you are worried then keep your worries to yourself [Music] no, I know you regret your defeat more than Aram's accident because you have won and lost the game, talk within your limits, I am saying absolutely right because I know you very well, you should not regret at all, rather at this time we all are worried  We should be thankful that Arham's life was saved. I don't know due to whose prayers Allah saved his life. What do you want to say that I did not pray for my son. There can be no prayer more powerful than a mother's. A wife's prayer is a relation connected to life. She leaves the parents, sister and brother with the support of this belief. So why shouldn't her prayer have any hope. Wow brother, today someone is talking very wisely. When you see a loved one so close to death, then you understand. You also feel someone's pain. What do you mean? He is your brother. Seeing him so close to death, I realized how much I love him. So at this time you should be with your loving brother. Momina is with her. She can take better care of him than all of us. You should be worried about what will be your role in his life after Momina. Areej. In what tone are you talking to her? Do you know what your relationship is with Fiza? Do you forget, Mama, relationships are maintained from both sides. I got married to Jawar or you?  I had a desire but did you ever feel this relation, did you never see love in it, right? I am sorry honey, but even in this it is your fault that no one can love you. We all are afraid of your selfishness. No, I am not the only one responsible for this, but this love [sangeet] which Sawar and I could not have for each other. Mama you know Sawar is a very practical person. He has a brain but no heart. And if there are no emotions in a person's life, if there is no love, then there is no use of his life. Inf aunty, I cannot tolerate all this anymore. You are insulting me and my brother. Have you thought for even a minute what the end result of all this is, the truth is that you should accept Momina? Do you think this ring in your hand will do some miracle? Aunty, you have seen that he has gone mad. He talks to his brother in the same way. That is why he does not like to see his face. He goes out of the city after pretending to be his father. I am seeing everything, that one girl has come.  Because of you everything has changed [Music] Fazah son don't worry I will make everything alright aunty please please don't repeat again that I will make everything alright my life has been ruined by listening to you please spare me son you haven't eaten anything since afternoon what? If you drink tea you will feel a little weak thank you what did you say to uncle what to do baba being our father right I like you baba you are like my baba I don't feel any confusion when you are around it feels as if everything is alright then why did you leave us I am still angry would you let your home break look son homes are built on these conditions of respect and love for home sorry please forgive me if you will forgive me then I will also forgive you I know he is still angry with me he has n't talked to me till now he will agree son he will agree that's why it is a little bit harmful you are also not talking to aunty you are angry with me you too  Forgive them, the day you kill your sister, I will forgive them [Music] Prem, go to sleep brother, go to sleep, come on, it's time to sleep, see what's the time [Music] Hello, Salam Walekum, listen, you changed the paper of the bed and before changing the paper, I applied coconut oil, right?
