[24.56] you also think that I am guilty of Shagufta you have become
[30.64] angry maybe I
[34.32] think so well why would I think like this your daughters have crossed all limits
[38.80] I have never seen you so harsh and too
[42.36] harsh in your nature
[45.80] and I have also never seen you with bad mind so
[48.80] in Abra these two went on whom it is
[52.92] all your fault you know daughters are someone else's trust you should
[55.92] not have given
[58.40] them so much importance you are saying absolutely right the
[61.12] fault is really mine
[64.80] because of me their happiness has got such evil eye I have tried a
[68.68] lot but I am not able to break it
[72.40] you will feel bad about what I am saying but believe me
[76.44] my heart is very sad seeing the condition of your house in the midst of
[79.84] centuries how could I see any
[84.24] dust or mark on anything in this house and
[90.96] this
[93.00] unlucky one who would have got the lap of his mother would have played today
[98.00] brothers and sisters are like mothers
[103.68] what kind of sisters are these that this innocent  He is
[107.12] not even allowed to touch her,
[109.28] how long will this go on, if I
[112.24] ask them
[115.64] [music]
[118.84] right
[121.12] Momna, how are you right
[127.32] now, son, how are you, and
[131.76] where is Momna, she has gone to the university, her exams are about to start, okay, she is
[138.32] busy with her exams,
[142.88] but you are at home these days,
[147.28] what a mess have you made of this house, it seems like
[149.80] someone has not come to this house for a long time,
[154.24] how can Shagufta's daughters be so irresponsible and senseless and I am
[158.56] also surprised at Torar Bhai that he has left all his work and is
[160.76] sitting at home
[162.20] and that
[164.44] innocent child, that innocent child, I feel as if he is growing up
[167.84] in an orphanage, you both are sisters, his
[171.12] sisters are in the place of a mother, if not
[174.84] that innocent child, take care of your father,
[180.84] I have not seen or heard much like this,
[184.76] first of all, you do
[188.44] not need to interfere in the matters of our house and
[190.72] secondly, if you have so much sympathy for that
[193.36] innocent child, then pick him up and take him to your house, there is
[196.96] no need to come here and lecture me,
[199.12] we are senseless, okay,
[207.80] very nonsense  Have you been able to take
[211.84] advantage of my love
[214.40] You two sisters have taken advantage of my softness If I am silent, it does
[217.44] not mean that I am dead along with your mother I
[226.04] can take care of myself and my child as long as I am alive, do you understand I do not
[230.20] need anyone's help I do not know
[233.36] why people pray for daughters I feel
[235.72] ashamed to
[238.60] call both of you my daughters
[240.48] who do not have anything called humanity
[247.76] [Music]
[252.80] You have found happiness by setting our house on fire
[255.76] Now go and celebrate in your house
[260.20] [Music]
[283.67] [Music]
[295.28] Momina
[298.56] Moman What rang with
[300.96] you How long will you keep running away from me If
[304.64] you think that it is my mistake, then at least
[306.32] give me a chance to correct my mistake friend And
[309.36] I am saying this for you too Otherwise I
[311.76] know that I did not have any wrong intention Yes,
[314.64] my reaction was wrong I have
[318.24] apologized for that to you as well as to Abir as well as to
[320.08] uncle What else do you want
[321.88] Muna I want to make everything the same as before
[325.64] Now nothing is the same as before
[328.48] neither me nor our life nor our
[333.68] house  When I go home, the
[336.56] house runs to bite me.
[341.12] Panic comes from Ammi's room
[343.04] and the child keeps crying all the time and I
[346.64] also feel like going to
[348.24] see her face,
[350.16] going near her, her
[353.60] voice reminds me of Ammi. It
[357.96] feels as if she is somewhere
[361.88] writhing in pain. Strong Mamna, life is
[365.28] very short. What is there today, is
[368.52] life. The rest is all forgiven.
[374.44] You are saying the right thing. I don't know what humans don't think.
[377.84] Allah does
[380.16] something that does
[383.88] not even happen in our imagination.
[390.68] I should walk. I
[391.76] don't want to walk on that path again,
[394.16] where my Ammi's memories are only
[398.12] in my mind. She
[400.24] lost her life because of some marriage. Don't talk to
[404.08] me. Life and death are
[407.24] not in the hands of humans. These are all decisions of nature.
[409.08] Still, I should walk. If
[411.48] aunty comes to know about it, she will be angry.
[415.00] She will say that
[417.56] even after so much insult, I don't
[420.48] leave you. The truth is
[423.44] Momna, neither do you leave me, nor do
[425.92] your
[431.04] memories stop calling you.  No matter how much I try, my
[435.04] heart ruins my efforts.
[439.92] Swarna Momna, I want to do everything first, I
[442.76] want to make everything right.
[446.16] For me, you are the most important.
[448.88] Everything else comes later. And for me,
[452.28] my self-respect is of utmost importance.
[456.56] How can I give that respect to your mama? The
[459.16] respect of that relationship which is like that of a mother, a
[463.28] relationship which is of great respect. [
[467.65] Music] I'm
[473.20] sorry, I will talk to mama
[476.10] [Music]
[481.86] [Music]
[502.04] Let's go from this house,
[503.36] Aapi, why are we living here when we don't have even a
[507.32] penny's respect in this house.
[511.00] Today, Baba has given me a lot of respect.
[514.04] She comes in front of my wife and tells me, what is
[517.88] her problem? Why does she interfere?
[522.68] What has happened in our life? Where will we go now?
[528.12] We will not go anywhere from this house. We will not
[532.56] stay here. He is just his son's father.
[536.28] Our sorrow, our pain is nothing for him.
[538.20] Today, he has ended all relationships.
[541.08] What has happened to Baba? Why is he taking out his child's
[545.16] anger on us? I should
[547.40] go and talk to Baba right now. There is no use in talking to Baba.
[549.04] They only listen to their heart
[552.40] and in their hearts, they have their son.
[555.96] Our relation with them ended
[558.84] when our mother died.
[561.40] I cannot live in this house, Aapi,
[565.56] I cannot live with the memories of my mother and
[568.16] when this father also
[569.68] lost his mind, what are you saying,
[572.12] where will we go, we have neither a home nor a
[574.36] place, we will go and camp on the road,
[580.12] listen to me, we have nothing else except this house,
[584.32] right now please don't get so emotional,
[589.36] by doing this you are causing pain to yourself
[592.16] and me too. I am
[595.56] not getting emotional, Aapi, I am telling the truth, I will go
[599.68] anywhere, to
[601.00] my college hostel, Memon hostel
[603.96] or anywhere, I feel suffocated here, I
[607.24] cannot live here, I
[609.20] cannot see this form of Baba, if
[611.80] you are coming then it's fine, otherwise I am leaving, I have
[613.92] lost my mind, give me a
[616.36] seat here, shut up and sit, enough is enough
[620.39] [Music]
[626.04] Look, listen to me
[632.77] [Music]
[634.16] this is our house,
[636.52] our Ammi's house,
[639.24] we will not go anywhere from here, it is
[643.80] your mistake,
[647.00] these things went away with Ammi and this
[651.36] This house belonged to Baba and now belongs to his son
[658.04] Daughters do not have a home
[662.16] Amma used to say, today I understand that if a
[667.56] mother dies the doors of the palaces are closed the
[672.36] daughters' home is finished oh

[871.40] better for me if he goes away I am

[880.48] way to return and no signal to go ahead the
[883.12] most unsure one is here you are the one
[888.80] in this house it's been two months since ammi went away
[893.00] baba did not sit with us even once he did not talk to us
[900.16] we also did not sit with him
[903.76] we are also blaming him for everything
[908.64] ah then he must have also got influenced by me
[914.68] mummy and baba's happiness and sorrows were together
[919.08] loneliness so  He must be feeling the same too, so this is what
[922.44] I am telling you, in Atul aunty's house,
[925.52] Arham bhai will be with you, he will be your
[930.52] companion in happiness, you don't need anyone else.
[935.68] Arham bhai is very nice,
[942.16] his heart is bigger than even Baba's, he
[945.96] was with us in everything, cried with us,
[949.36] scolded us, got angry,
[952.76] he supported us a lot,
[957.00] please judge, right decisions are not made, let
[961.72] my exams be over, I will get a
[964.56] job at a good place and everything will be fine,
[967.84] nothing will be fine, you see,
[974.32] I have decided how to make everything right,
[979.60] if life has put me to test, then
[983.56] I will not accept defeat,
[989.96] Mummy's head will bow down, people will talk about her
[993.56] and I will not like it
[994.94] [Music]
[996.52] I will not let Mummy's head hide,
[1000.60] if you want Mummy's happiness, then get
[1004.04] married,
[1005.92] after this I will not make any demand
[1010.20] [Music]
[1017.48] Truth be told, he keeps crying all the time,
[1021.40] where are you going, I am going to close the door, I
[1025.00] cannot tolerate it
[1027.53] [Music]
[1030.80] voice, what should I do,
[1033.00] Sami, don't cry, don't cry, wait, wait, come,
[1037.28] ok, come, come, come  Come here,
[1042.80] oh son, yes, yes, just don't cry, why did
[1049.08] you call me in such an emergency?
[1051.48] I am scared, is everything alright? He does
[1054.28] n't know what happened. He is crying a lot.
[1056.60] Just look at him. He was absolutely fine till evening.
[1059.44] Tell me, he has drunk milk. Let
[1063.84] me see if
[1066.48] he is having motions. I am not able to understand anything.
[1069.76] Sister, he drinks milk and vomits it.
[1073.44] Now what medicine should I give to such a small child? To
[1077.40] me, you also look sick.
[1080.60] Abrar Bhai, bring me his feeder. There are
[1084.92] ways to feed a child. If
[1087.76] Shagufta was here, she would have told you. Please give me a
[1091.72] good pair of shoes for him. I will get them changed.
[1094.16] Then after that, we will go to the doctor. He gets a little
[1097.24] sick because of dirt. If the
[1100.88] doctor comes to know about this, he will be very
[1102.72] angry. Do you have any baby oil or
[1107.36] powder? You are using it like this. Whatever you have is in
[1110.72] front of you. Sister, please look at it. I
[1114.36] myself am not able to understand what to do. The
[1118.00] child is so small, small. He is wearing these clothes. [
[1120.41] Music]
[1137.32] Take it
[1140.38] [Music]
[1154.88] Abrar Bhai, you are deaf.  If you don't agree then one thing is
[1159.68] coming to my tongue
[1162.60] this
[1164.48] child and this house needs an sensible woman
[1170.92] running a house and raising children is not a man's cup of tea
[1175.04] some work suits a woman so
[1180.04] you are doing well
[1183.84] I have spoken to a couple of people
[1186.80] Insha Allah I hope that arrangement for a maid will be made it has been
[1190.48] so many days I have
[1193.00] not gone to the office my whole system has become confused a maid is a maid after all
[1200.72] and how can she give the status of a mother these
[1205.44] issues of yours will keep on going Apara
[1211.42] [Sangeet] I do
[1213.32] n't understand what to
[1217.48] do is there any good woman in your view who can
[1221.56] look after the house and take care of this as well
[1227.16] see
[1228.88] maybe you will not mind my advice
[1231.44] but Apara Bhai your daughters are
[1235.24] not worthy of anything if they were there then I would not have said this
[1238.80] but it is true
[1242.80] that this child needs a mother
[1246.08] hospital doctor this is a matter of later he will
[1250.20] rule
[1251.20] my mother you should get married
[1259.19] [Sangeet]
[1278.19] [Sangeet]
[1281.88] what happened
[1284.56] just now why did you go away I was
[1287.04] thinking once that without you we will
[1289.92] die what happened sister what happened tell me
[1294.28] Baba has said something,
[1295.80] Seba aunty has come, she must have
[1299.12] given some fatwa, so I will go and see,
[1303.36] right now
[1305.88] no, she said nothing
[1308.27] [Sangeet] I ca
[1316.00] n't wait to go towards the room,
[1321.16] I can't wait either,
[1324.60] and have you seen Baba, what a state he has
[1328.16] created in that room
[1331.14] [Sangeet] Come on aunty, it's
[1340.16] okay, it will be fine, Inshallah relax
[1343.53] [Sangeet]
[1349.96] Allah has always
[1352.44] put Abrar in some or the other test, so I am
[1355.28] very worried about him,
[1358.16] friend, I can't understand what will happen to him, were the
[1361.84] problems of the first two daughters not enough, at
[1364.84] this age the responsibility of a son has also
[1366.40] fallen on his head, you are absolutely right,
[1370.44] after Shagufta aunty's death, Momina has travelled the most in that house,
[1376.08] I didn't help her at all,
[1379.12] what is the use of such a relationship,
[1382.32] Papa, please tell Mama that you should
[1385.04] not delay the marriage at all, have
[1387.76] we taken the contract of the needs of the whole family,
[1391.32] I thought that
[1395.00] after all this, you will refuse this marriage
[1397.56] and would have insulted you again and again
[1400.60] And you repeatedly suppress your self-respect and
[1402.24] reach there uncle, I do
[1404.52] n't want to argue with you, but this relationship is
[1407.20] not like a glass that
[1409.24] breaks with a little hurt. You do
[1411.88] n't care about our respect, you only care about your
[1414.36] relationship. The
[1415.92] respect that you care so much about, you
[1420.44] sometimes give the same respect to others as well. [

[1509.60] Hello, Salam Walekum, brother, how are you? Yes,
[1515.12] I am fine, Aapi, how are you? Aapi is
[1517.88] not well. She is resting. What happened?
[1520.52] Show her to a doctor. She doesn't even talk to me.
[1524.48] How will the depression reduce?
[1526.68] I will come with you. Let's take her to a doctor. No, no, there is no
[1532.00] need for you to come. I have given her a tablet. She will be
[1534.08] fine if she rests for a while. Yaar,
[1536.24] you people have completely minused me from your life. I am
[1537.64] tired of
[1539.64] fighting alone. At least you
[1541.20] support me now. Please switch off the light. I am feeling
[1545.84] sleepy. I want to sleep.
[1550.75] [Sangeet]
[1556.68] hmm
[1557.82] [Sangeet]
[1565.24] Whatever is happening is happening only because of you.
[1568.40] You favour him in every wrong thing.
[1572.40] Day by day he is going out of my control.
[1576.60] Explain to him. I am his mother. I can be lenient to a certain extent.
[1582.04] This is all your doing.
[1585.72] Atul, you keep hurting him all the time. He is
[1588.60] not a child, he has grown up. Now do
[1592.20] n't say such things that make him angry.
[1595.12] And the chapter of Shagufta is now closed.
[1597.68] Atul, forgive him for God's sake.
[1600.52] What do you want to say?
[1604.68] What do you mean by saying that I am a cruel woman.
[1607.16] I am the enemy of my son's happiness. Is
[1610.44] this what I have not been able to understand till date. At
[1613.00] what time are you whose enemy and at
[1614.92] what time whose
[1616.60] friend?
[1620.68] Why is your hatred so intense with Abrar and his family? By the way
[1626.00] Atul, look, if you want, everyone can be happy in this house,
[1631.20] but you will have to clear your heart for him.
[1634.48] What do you want to say?
[1638.16] What do you mean by this? Whenever I
[1641.60] remember the attitude of that mad girl, Bir,  So my
[1644.04] blood starts boiling,
[1649.84] look
[1650.88] Atul, I am not going to marry Abhir, I am
[1654.08] going to marry Momina, Afan sahab, sisters have a
[1658.76] great impact on sisters, you should understand this,
[1662.24] nothing has gone wrong yet, there is still time
[1666.28] and you should make me understand that I should stop dreaming of building a relationship with those people, my
[1668.84] friend, I have
[1671.84] not been able to make you understand till date, so
[1673.68] how can I make anyone else
[1675.32] understand, you should consider someone an enemy for once,
[1679.32] okay, then that state of mind will be in your control, your heart
[1682.76] wants to put your thumb on his throat and
[1685.40] choke him, just do it my friend, for God's sake, what has
[1689.88] happened, forgive everyone, for Allah's sake

[1738.16] you did not understand here  Yes, isn't it Zeba? Oh Allah,
[1743.76] how are you? I am absolutely fine. I am
[1747.52] seeing you after so many years. And look,
[1749.92] I recognised you as soon as I saw you. You have
[1751.64] n't changed at all. Believe me, I am
[1754.52] so happy to see you. I am also very
[1756.52] happy. By the way, is there something in me that can
[1758.64] change? Tell me, how are you?
[1761.24] And how are you here? Ay, who? Have
[1764.56] you become the mother of grandchildren? For God's
[1767.68] sake, don't get upset yet. Tell me the truth.
[1769.60] No, I don't have any grandchildren. I am not that
[1771.72] old yet that I can become the mother of grandchildren. Do
[1773.68] n't go into that either. This is our
[1776.92] neighbour Abrar Bhai, his son. The same Abrar
[1779.80] Bhai who just bumped into you. Oh Allah,
[1782.28] loudly. Yes, he is the one. So who is he? He must be your
[1786.24] Samadhi Mamad. Tell me the truth.
[1790.44] Where is the mother of this child? Why are you carrying him
[1792.00] in your lap? Oh, I am
[1794.12] not related to his mother. Neither are I related to her. She
[1797.28] died during delivery. And
[1801.32] being a neighbour, I don't have to do that.
[1804.40] Believe me, family,
[1807.64] I am very fed up of this untimely labour. Oh, I can understand that
[1810.44] they have only one child.  Has Allah
[1812.96] blessed him with more children? He has two young daughters. May
[1816.32] Allah give good guidance to the children of today. They do
[1819.48] not take care of him at all. They do
[1822.44] not even look at him. They say that because of him
[1824.52] our mother died. Oh, Oh.
[1827.48] Poor Apara also remains very worried. What's the good thing? By the way, he has got
[1830.44] motions. He has a
[1832.68] fever. He is very unwell. Come on, let me
[1834.92] see.
[1840.52] [Music]
[1843.48] Come, where have these people gone? Will it not get
[1849.04] worse then? Oh
[1856.24] Allah.
[1862.81] [Music]
[1880.07] [Music]
[1898.52] Seba, first of all the child is weak from birth. On top of that he is
[1904.04] also premature.
[1909.76] Look, it is very difficult to raise a weak child and a child without a mother.
[1912.92] I think that
[1915.76] instead of bringing him to the hospital, you should take him to a
[1918.16] good child specialist. Is there anything
[1920.72] serious? What were
[1922.64] you saying? He will get well soon,
[1926.40] right? Oh, Apar brother, why are you getting so worried.
[1929.04] This is not your first child
[1930.96] and he will get well. Don't worry at all.
[1934.12] It's good that you people
[1936.44] brought him on time. Otherwise, due to lack of water, the child could have
[1939.16] died. This is the fault
[1941.44] of sister Seba.  It's a kindness, I was
[1944.16] not in my senses at all, now I have to be conscious. Sir,
[1948.08] your child is premature and he
[1950.36] needs intensive care. Though I have
[1954.28] night duty here, but at
[1957.08] 4 in the afternoon, I work with a very good child
[1959.08] specialist, she is
[1960.84] also a mother herself and Allah has blessed her with healing as
[1963.72] well. You should bring this child there, he will be
[1966.08] examined in detail there. I will give this
[1968.00] advice, she is
[1969.96] right, now he
[1973.60] may need a doctor at any time, do this,
[1976.64] brother, take that doctor's phone number and address, I will
[1979.72] go and show him in the morning,
[1981.84] I will tell you how to
[1984.20] use the medicine and there is a drop in it, they also give it right
[1986.00] now,
[1987.80] I don't want to give him more medicines right now
[1990.76] because tomorrow he will get it from the doctor,
[1993.56] tell me the truth,
[1998.04] I am giving you his address and my phone
[2001.12] number, okay, call me before coming, the
[2004.36] line is very long there,
[2007.56] so I will take your number in advance,
[2009.88] thank you very much, great
[2035.96] kindness
[2043.58] [Music]
[2072.60] Baba has not come home since last night, his phone is
[2076.00] also there  It is coming close, please ask Nala
[2078.76] I am not asking anything, you should have
[2080.68] told Baba
[2083.32] where you are going and when you will return but
[2085.88] no, he is only worried about his son
[2090.29] [music]
[2093.60] That poor guy is unwell since last night, I do
[2099.88] n't know what condition he would be in now,
[2103.64] leave worrying about him,
[2105.16] Baba is there to take care of him, you worry about yourself,
[2112.60] listen to me, don't be too harsh with Arham Bhai, yesterday there was a
[2117.00] crying voice on his phone, he
[2119.40] respects you
[2120.37] [music]
[2122.80] how can I forget you that he is Atul Aunty
[2125.56] 's son, sinner Atul Aunty is a self-absorbed
[2129.80] patient and such people don't see anyone except themselves, if
[2133.88] I were in your place, I would have taken pity on them
[2137.28] and seen the spectacle of their irritation, you
[2143.48] know what the issue is that I am
[2147.12] not like you,
[2148.96] you are my brave Hitler sister,
[2154.08] when Allah was making you, did he
[2156.84] make you with great leisure or is he making you a masterpiece,
[2163.80] tell me, you are the one, in this world there is no decency and no
[2168.44] one for decency  There is no demand, the more
[2170.64] bad-tempered a person is, the more people
[2173.84] stay intimidated by him in order to save their respect
[2177.68] and do you remember how I drove your company away
[2182.80] and after that I angered Arham and Amma and I
[2187.40] forgot that, I don't remember such things,
[2190.12] you have to spend your life with me, you should
[2192.04] remember that it
[2193.80] seems Baba has come and if Arham is a brother
[2215.68] then
[2220.56] Salam Walekum Walekum Salam Ji,
[2223.88] someone told me that a maid is needed here for a small child
[2227.35] [Music]
