Hara Dil Sajna Hara Dil Sajna [Music] Sajna I am sorry, she fell asleep brother, no problem, take rest, her drip is over, I thought to remove the drip, well done, my duty timings were over, then I thought I should go and meet her, I do n't know how she will be then, thank you very much, by the way, you know Zeba used to live in my neighborhood before her marriage, she told me that your wife has passed away, I want to know, by the way, you are a man of great courage, you are raising a premature baby, that too without a mother, Allah has given you courage, when something falls on your head, Allah makes some way or the other, just pray that you don't have to come to this hospital again, I did not get much happiness from here, Insha Allah it will be like this, by the way, I am feeling good now, much better, but still I will tell you to definitely show her to a specialist tomorrow, how are you Bemi, brother, you took out the time, thank you very much, no, let's go tomorrow, we will meet, take care of yourself, and if there is any problem, please come out to the nurse school, thank you very much, Shami baby, how will you be  Are you feeling well now? Okay, I understand that he is your child. [Music] He is a gift from Allah. Look, sister, I am not a woman who works from house to house. I have three small children of my own. If fate is bad, I have to work. Then you will leave your child here. You will have to stay here for a long time. I will leave him with my mother-in-law. My poor husband used to set up a vegetable cart. One day there was an explosion and I, the unfortunate one, did not even get to see his face. I had heard that the government would help, but till date we have not seen any help. The government only talks, it does not help. This helplessness has brought me to your door. I will take complete care of your brother. You can be completely carefree about him. I cannot stay late at night, but I will come early in the morning. I will take full 1000 rupees. I will do all the work of your child. Wash his clothes, bathe him, wash him, everything. Okay, tell me, do you have a phone? Actually, I want Baba to come, then I will talk to him and then I will tell you.  You give me your number, I will talk to Baba and let you know, you can call me on this number, it is possible that some means can be created for me, okay, you go, the means can be created for you because our Baba is ready to do anything for his son, you see, Aadhi is hiring a 12 year old maid for her son and a simple aunt for Ammi, Baba had a problem with the maid, Ammi had a problem with Baba, don't be so proud, if you sleep so much, life will become difficult, life has already become very difficult, what will be more difficult than this [Sangeet], what should I do now with this girl [Sangeet], I salute your courage, she stays awake here the whole night and then leaves for her clinic job early, what should I do, what should I say, while hiding the light of my eyes, even sleep has hidden somewhere from me, now the day I get off from work, I spend the whole night awake, today I am going to some sister's house or the market, I am thinking of going to the market, come see, she brought my dupatta  G It has become very old my Amma does not recognize the dupatta I just have to bring the dupatta Nothing else of yours I just had to bring the dupatta ok ok if you remember anything then message me and yes listen the patient in front is very unwell keep checking her BP and get up let's do rounds you people have got into the habit of resting get up quickly ok Allah Hafiz hey Salam Walekum Walekum Assalam where are you going alone I did not get Raksha there so I thought maybe I would get a ride ahead ok what is such a thing I will drop you sitting here no no you will have to face unnecessary trouble oh no no on your pretext I will also meet Jeeva many thanks very much Sam a Sami ji f Amma yes I am going towards Abir there is no need to go there she is an ill mannered and bad minded girl it is better to stay away from her and anyway you will not find anyone good in her company if you did not have the compulsion of a mother's child then I swear I would not have even turned back to that house see Abrar bring me into life  There are ups and downs but they should not affect our relationship If you were in the hospital you could have at least called me I would have come friend you could have sent me at least you could have done this much You have done a lot of favour to me friend I am incapable of repaying her debt Just pray for me friend After Shagufta's departure my life has turned upside down I am unable to understand what to do and I have been wanting to talk to you for a long time but I was unable to gather courage Look you have to come out of the grief of Shagufta now Look your children don't need only your company you have to do a lot more for them and I heard that you have taken a long leave from the office what will happen by taking that leave brother after all you will have to go back how will this work [Sangeet] You are listening to this voice that is why you did not even let me grieve for Shagufta just now [Sangeet] came Do you know Jeba when people say such things that a woman waits for a man waits for him dresses up for him and her whole life is for him All these things seem very bookish to me. I do n't trust them. So listen, no one has ever looked at you in this way. Hey, your job is to sit with men day and night. [Sangeet] Get up. Maybe that's why till date no man's eyes have ever rested on me. Men like women covered up in burqas. But you know Jeeva, if a man's eyes had rested on me, not only would I have made his heart but also his home prosperous. It would have been great fun. I have not one but four children running here and there. Wow, what a life I would have had. You would have spent your mountain-like life raising your sister's children. [Sangeet] There is still time, start thinking about yourself. These people have put you on a pedestal not just because of your earnings. Stop giving up now. They will lift you from their heads and throw you on the ground and then wo n't even look back. [Sangeet] People are right. I know all these things. But what should I do? When I think about myself, I get very depressed. Time stops. It does n't pass at all. That's why.  I do two jobs so that neither my body goes there nor my heart is sad. Listen Femi one thing has just come to my mind, you should think carefully, see, Allah gives signals to his servants. Abrar Bhai is a very good man. I had told him the same thing a few days back that Abrar Bhai does not need an understanding woman for your house and the same thing I am telling you today, you will get an understanding man like Abrar Bhai, you will get a ready-made house, your life will be made better. Hey, have you gone mad Jeba, should I get married? Why should I get married? Should I lose my freedom? Why is she very dear to me brother? I cannot lose her. And look brother, if the marriage had happened at the right time, then I would have got married by now, I would have taken care of everything at home, now I cannot do that. You did not bring me up for no reason, so consider me a sister or a friend. No matter what the age of a woman is, freedom becomes a cause of disgrace for her. See, get married and settle down, your days and nights will be peaceful. Then you will like the house as well as the comfort of home. Jeba, think for yourself, use your wisdom, those two young daughters.  Who is his father brother, why would he marry me? The wings of a surkhab have put me under, why would he do that, crazy man? Leave it all to me, you calm down and decide after thinking carefully Apara is very good, he had always kept Shagufta happy, his two daughters will also get married, and as for the son, he will always be with you, Pami think about it [Music] Baat Chacha pala baby Chacha pala baby Soz Soja Soz baby so la [Music] Babi Allah ha Allah ha Allah ha Allah alla alla la Sooz you pala baby [Music] Sooz Happy Birthday to you Happy Birthday to you [Music] You Happy Birthday to you [Prashansa] You Hello, where are you, have you seen the time? What time is it? It's so late. You know that if you get even a little late, I get so upset. Why haven't you come home yet? Now I'm so sorry Aapi, I was going to call you only. Actually, after college, Kiran's birthday was planned. Birthday party at home. Yes, she was giving a treat, so we all came to her house. Abhir, you could have at least told me where you were going, whose house you were going to, you just went with your head held high, what has happened to anyone's house, why are you talking like this, and anyway, I have come out after so many days, I was going from home to Delhi to come back home, that's why you came to Kiran's house, now put the phone down and let me relax a little [Music] [Music] It's late, baby, baby is here [Music] [Music] No, Abhira Bhai, what time is this, thank you for coming from college, do you remember anything other than this child, Kabir's college time, his not coming home, you at least remembered that we both are also your daughters, how can I forget my daughters who see the spectacle of my helplessness, but don't like to pick up this innocent child in their lap, as if it is a crime [Music] [Music] My sister, crying is in her fate, let her cry, it would be better if you don't talk to me at this time [Music] [Prashasa] [Music] Oh ho Shami Shami, look what your Baba has brought [Prashansa] If she were your mother, she would have done everything for you baby, see, if she were your mother, she would have done all this, look, Baba has brought me a mother for you, he doesn't cry and keeps crying the whole day, I have asked Azar brother to bring another mother for him, if he can, he won't be able to find peace without a mother, the only difference is that you do n't see my tears but I can hear his voice, you are right, I have run out of words to explain myself, I had heard that elder sisters are equal to mothers, what kind of a sister are you, this poor guy keeps crying, keeps suffering and you never even look back at him, oh that Abira is young, she is still naive, she doesn't understand, Abira doesn't understand, Baba, she is the most sensitive among us, she is Ammi's favourite, you know she has now started looking for ways to escape from this house, today she had gone to one of her friend's house because she does n't feel like staying in this house, oh what should I do, how can I make you both happy, I was not so lonely even when the earthquake happened  All my loved ones are dead [Music] Your mother did not do well to me, he is not even able to breathe properly, she has handed him over to me. I do not know how to raise children. What should I do? It was your own decision. You wanted a son and mother wants your happiness. It is not just my son, you have a brother too. What should I do? What should I do with this brother? He is the brother because of whom our mother is not with us. You will bring another mother for him. What will happen to us? Our mother will never come back. Never [Music] [Music] [Praise] [Music] Ba tu Allah ask what work have you put me on [Music] I wa [Music] I am looking for such a person near Ar Sahab. The fragrance is very good [Music] y aleikum Abra Sahab, I was just thinking about you, yes, you will reach there at 4:00. Don't worry at all, first of all get your child checked up. [Music] [ Praise] [ Music] Ungiyard [Music] Momna yaar, what's the problem with you and we have been searching for you there for a long time.  And you are sitting here, I will call him and he will come here, no don't call me, I have to go to the book store quickly ma'am, so you go with him, he has been looking for you for so long, he was worried about what has happened to you, he should know something, he keeps looking for you, you keep hiding from him, you both start playing a strange game of hide and seek, the game ends even before it starts, tell him, why will I tell you, you tell yourself, Raj sahab, becoming a father and being called a father is very easy, but all the difficulties come to the mother's share and the cruelty is that no one can understand her difficulties, but your courage is saluted, you are the mother of this child as well as the father, I am thankful to Allah that he made me capable of taking responsibility for him, otherwise I was not capable of this, yes you are right, but see how patient the child is, he did not even cry, maybe Allah gives patience to children without a mother, and after this injection he will have fever and pain too, so maybe he will cry a little  So if his health is very bad then this is the medicine, give him half a spoon of each. If he has a high fever. Okay, thank you very much doctor, because of you very important work has been done, otherwise I did not remember that he also needs to get vaccinated. You are a little late, but it doesn't matter. Look, I have made a card. Whenever you get his vaccination done, get it entered in this card. Okay, this way you will remember it, now you will remember it completely. Now I cannot forget and anyway we will come to Aapi for vaccination. It is okay that Sami has got used to your hands, but you should not spoil your habits. This clinic is very far from your house. There is any small clinic near your house, you can get the injection from there. Thank you very much Avraj sahab, if you have any problem, then call me. Thank you very much. Better, very much [Music] Doubt yes, show me what happened. I agree that for some days nothing was right between me and Mamna. Okay, my Mamna's thinking is of the 20th century, but somewhere she is right and I like her thinking.  It doesn't matter to her. Momina and I have spent our lives together and she is not ready to understand that. She is a stupid girl. This is a very serious problem. I thought there was some misunderstanding between you two, but here the whole family is evolved and it is very difficult to make our emotional mothers understand. So I am ready to do this difficult task. I have fought for her before also and I will fight in the future too. At least she should support me. I had stopped her, tried a lot to make her understand but she doesn't listen. She is very stubborn. And you know what she said before leaving. She said that some games end even before they begin. [Sangeet] She is talking about the game. In this, not only one person loses. Both of them lose, life and happiness. You tell her that if I become adamant, she will sit and cry all her life. [ Sangeet] And you, who are you? Your praise, I have got an appointment here. I got the appointment. [Music] You [Music] Abrar sahab, you have to raise your voice against injustice. Appointing someone else in your place is sheer injustice. These people have taken advantage of your helplessness. People come to us with their issues and the cruelty is that to whom should we take our complaint? After hearing my complaint, people look at me as if I am lying. Now who should explain to them that okay, it was my wish to have a child, but it is Allah's wish, is n't it? Abrar sahab, how is your son? Seeing his condition, I could not believe that he will survive so soon. May Allah give you courage. You have shown by becoming a mother. May Allah give him a long life. Amen. Pray for a long life with good health. Rest, he will get whatever is destined for him. For now, try to make his fate. If you have a job, his needs will be fulfilled. You should make a separate arrangement for a nanny etc. for him. And yes, your daughters are also very intelligent. You should hand him over to them and you should take care of your seat. Now if you get a seat, it is fine. Here, the situation changes every hour.  Yes sir, I had also told you that these mistresses are not friends of anyone, but after the death of your wife, you disappeared from here as if it was not your wife, but for God's sake, you left this world. Sir, you should take Pachaar sahab to your aid [sangeet] It was a good joke, at this age you should have children, that too of someone else. Apara Bhai took too much advantage of Murat and this Kausar, she has also not come yet. I will throw her out of the house standing. What is the use of such a maid who is not even aware of her child. It is a problem. Where is my phone? Hello, brother, if you had to go to office, you should have at least stopped Abir. Neither your daughters are capable of anything, nor your maid. What are you paying salary for? She sits after taking leave everyday, look Apara Bhai, I also have 100 household works to do. I have been sitting since long with Sami in my lap [sangeet] Sorry sir, it is very important to go to college from home. Maybe this job does not hold much importance for you, but it is not possible for us to keep the seat vacant for long. I had to take this decision in favour of the company. Sir, you are talking about the job which supports my family. Why would I not give importance to it? Sir, this file is asking me to resign. Imran sahab, this file has been prepared on the instructions of Chairman sahab and whether to keep you in the company or not is the decision of Chairman sahab. This is wrong sir. I had told him about my compulsion. My wife has passed away. My child was in the hospital. Your child was in the ICU. I mean a small child. My wife died on his birth. Sir, I have given 15 years to this firm. How can you do this injustice to me? Ibrar sahab, I am not doing anything wrong with you. I am just telling you the decision of the company. If you want, you can meet Chairman sahab in this regard. I am just doing what I have been told. [Music] Sir, thank you sir. Thank you [Music] [ Music] [Music] We will all go. Baba is tired. Let him rest. You both go and put him to sleep. Good night Baba. Good [Music] Night Assalam  Walekum sahab ji, I have put the child to sleep. I was taking him for a walk since morning but he was crying a lot. I feel he is having pain in his stomach. You should show him to a doctor. He is not having pain in his stomach. Don't make up stories on your own. Understood? Hello baby. Hello. Who applied kajal in his eyes? Who told you to apply kajal in his eyes? Have you gone crazy? Hey, grown up women apply it in their eyes. You applied it in the child's eyes. It was kept on the dressing table inside, so I applied it. Applying kajal in children's eyes does not make their eyes big. They do not become big. It is harmful. You also should not apply it in your children's eyes. Do n't go mad. I am fooling you for no reason. Its eyes are open. Milk has spilled. You don't do your work carefully and you keep on applying kajal. Or you keep on watching TV. Go, go and see who has come outside. Oh my son, go, you have ruined all your eyes. You have applied all the kajal, friend. This is very  She is a crazy girl, come clean it, I do n't know who put it on it, it didn't come off, hey hey what are you doing
