There is no need for you to talk to the girl. We, the girl's people, should take the initiative and in this way, our Momina's respect and honour will increase. [Music] Alam waaleikum Baba waaleikum [Music] Assalam, brother, sit comfortably and drink water. What's the hurry? Baba. I have a special class today. I am already late. That's why I'm in a hurry. Momina, son, sit comfortably and have your breakfast. How did you get up and leave like this? Mummy, it's very late. Okay, let me buy an apple, let me buy the other one too. Allah Hafiz Baba, Allah Hafiz son, you see, it's as if she has sworn not to take care of herself. Now, where will she face problems in relationships? Please go and drop her off. Hey brother, every Sunday, friend, I come to pick you up like this. Why are you taking tension? Sit down and have your breakfast. [Music] Sit down [ Music] Sorry, it's difficult to even wait for a second in your street. You made me wait for half an hour. You know how difficult it is for me to wait.  I feel that if coming here and waiting is so difficult then don't come. You are comfortable. Don't complicate your life because of me. [Music] Listen. I have come this far and I have no intention of going back. I need your company to walk on all these roads. [Music] And if you don't accompany me, then I will take you with me. Come on [Music] Come on [Music] How many days have you not got your car serviced? How many times will I say the same thing? Why don't you understand? If you don't want to work, then go from here. Salam Begum Sahiba. You should have been with Arham at this time, right Begum Sahiba. He had refused to come with me. I am obedient to his orders. What could I do? Stop talking nonsense. You are obedient to my orders. I understood. If you have to work, then do it this way. Otherwise, you should also get out of here. Begum Sahiba. I understand my job as well as my responsibility. You should make Arham understand. He doesn't want to take you along. So what would I do? Get out of here. Get out of here right now.  Don't show your face to me again, mummy, there is no such pair in these that I can wear to a wedding, and look at these long frocks, the fashion of these is also out of date, so tell me one thing, does your fashion change every month, you had just bought these clothes, it has not been a month since they were bought for Faza's wedding, and you had bought them as per your choice, now what is so bad in these, I should also know, oh mummy, I had bought them from the sale, that too for Rs. 10000, if I wear this shabby piece of yours in the neighborhood, I will get a lot of praise, but in Areej's wedding, no way, I have no interest in getting myself insulted, and have you seen Atul aunty, she roams around wearing a suit worth Rs. 10,000 even in her house, if she can afford it, then she should wear it, hey, when the difference between their and our status is huge, then what is the need for you to compete, yes, there is a difference like heaven and earth, by the way, mummy, I don't understand what is common in the friendship of Afan uncle and Baba, and also, childhood friendship like this does n't happen even in films, there too  The style has changed, just do it. You don't need to talk much. No matter how expensive the clothes you wear, we can't reach their status. And anyway, we should only dream as much as we can hold in our eyes. So, the dreams we see are their problem and it is also important for them to go. It is not necessary for me to go. You talk so much, pick it up and go from here before Mama comes. And listen, take this too. Servants should be kept in their place, son. Otherwise, they get on top of their heads. It seems that someone is in trouble again today. By the way, Mama only works at your behest and I do n't treat you for anything. He listens to what you say with one ear and blows it out of the other. Isn't it? How naive you are, son. Get used to seeing life with a wise eye. I don't want you to say such things in front of your husband after marriage. Whoever has his own status, let him stay within his status. I understood, please Mama, this principle of yours doesn't apply to me. At least the husband can carry on our status. yes you should have some problem easily he roams around day and night and the streets in which his car also goes with great difficulty [sangeet] he is Momina Momina listen what is your problem why do you often behave so strange has something happened at home has uncle or aunty said something you have not come home for tea for many days maybe he forgot the way to our house or something else that's it and whatever happens after that thankfully we do n't know anything about it otherwise we would go mad just thinking about it I do n't even want to know anything about my future my future is in front of me [sangeet] very beautiful very wonderful sometimes the thing which is in front of us we have it but it is not ours ah please don't pace mystic the thing which belongs to the one gets it come let me drop you [sangeet] you [sangeet] brother I liked Anush very much I have specially invited her in Raj's mehndi and we you should meet her I want to you she is a student of international media  She can manage her lifestyle Anush are you serious Mama you have liked that girl for me there is nothing girlish about it why Papa I am right [Sangeet] no looking for a girl is a very boring job I like Anush very much in fact my Bhabhi should be like her stunning stylish outspoken you lock her down she will be perfect for you why did you both get into the trap of getting me married I was not in favour of Aariz getting married so soon in fact there is a time for everything Ram and I want you to get serious about your marriage you complete your semester till then we will complete the preparations for your marriage Umma please please you will not talk to Anush or me Subhan for my marriage she will be your type not my type [Sangeet] I will marry only that girl whom I like okay the choice should definitely be yours but I will be my friend you have not met her yet I am sure when you meet her you will change your mind [Sangeet] you will give salad Look Papa, you know my opinion cannot be changed, it is not like coffee in my life that I keep changing the taste and checking it, you know very well that Atul is not in the habit of compromising, he will use his status, high family and his friendship card with Subhan family to harm himself and you too, this is his problem Papa, I wanted to study medicine, but they put me in business, it's fine but I will not compromise on my emotions, your mother has not accepted my friendship with Abrar till date and if she had come to know earlier that your friendship with Momina will reach this extent, she would have posted guards around you, now I myself pay the salary to the guards for not doing the duty, however, I have a request to you son, whatever commitment you make to Momina, you must fulfil it, I don't want to be embarrassed in front of Abrar [Sangeet] Son Papa, do you know what is the best part of my friendship with Momina [Sangeet] there is no commitment, no obstacle between us [Music] Still I feel that whenever I meet her I am the happiest. Papa you yourself say that for a successful married life it is very important for the husband and wife to be friends. So I just want to see my best friend in my home and in my life. Please tell uncle not to make my life difficult. I really love her. You are absolutely right son. The relationships that give happiness are the ones that are closest to the heart. I do not promise that I will change your mother 's thinking. It is not an easy task to do so. But I assure you that I will support you as far as possible. Thank you. [Music] You. [Music] [Music] [Music] Yes, by mistake you took my number. Listen you are that mistake of my life which I switch on with great happiness. By the way, at this time of the night, that too is such a thing. Oh Allah. Well, tell me one thing. Those who talk such big things, who just talk like lions, there should be a cure for them. Think about it. There is a cure but it is not possible without your evolution. Life time consultancy.

You have wasted your money by being so formal, you know very well that Ari only wears bras, aunty.

You have no right to talk to me like this. Shut up. I had heard that a person's respect is in his own hands, but you people are roaming around with your disgrace in your own hands.
