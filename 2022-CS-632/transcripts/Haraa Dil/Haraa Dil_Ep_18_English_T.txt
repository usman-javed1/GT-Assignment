[664.08] What do you think? All this is yours. It is your
[668.04] father's. Your father is dead. Anyway, all this is
[672.76] mine.
[676.24] Look, you should listen to Kasi. Kasi is a big
[681.44] scoundrel.
[683.40] He will chop your brother into small pieces and
[687.36] bury him in the neighborhood. You will go
[691.76] mad while searching. Your life will pass.
[694.24] And why should you follow a boy? I will
[700.20] tell you the story of that
[703.84] boy. His mother hates you.
[708.24] And she doesn't even hate you in a small way.
[712.44] She wants me to poison you.

[893.28] and you don't worry, we will reach home soon,
[896.36] and anyway, the police has got a clue, we have done
[899.96] what we had to do, the
[903.04] rest of the action is of the police,
[906.04] Momna Ibrar Khatar Ibrar Hussain, your
[910.24] Nikah is with Kas Shafiq, in Mubal 0000 Haq, and
[914.68] in the presence of these witnesses,
[917.12] do you accept this Nikah
[923.80] [Music]

[936.32] married, why didn't you tell
[942.08] me, Haram, look, they are marrying me forcibly,
[945.24] they threatened me that they will kill Sami,
[947.72] Haram, please Haram, save Sami, hey,
[950.96] stop this drama, first of all, when I said
[954.00] marry Kas, he immediately agreed  I accepted it
[956.16] happily and now as soon as it came in front of me, I
[959.20] started saying, oh aunt, what kind of a girl is this?
[962.28] You were saying that she is very innocent, but she
[964.12] turned out to be so cunning. These people are lying, I
[966.00] swear that there is nothing like that.
[968.48] They will kill everyone. Please
[970.92] save Sami. Oh, you are lying.
[973.12] Why would we kill the child? Tell me yourself
[974.92] why would we kill him. Okay, we will sit and
[977.08] talk comfortably. You give Sami to me.
[978.60] If he has promised to marry you,
[980.76] I am promising you that I will be
[982.04] able to marry you. And you
[984.00] keep quiet, friend, this is it. You are from our
[986.64] community. I am not just from your
[989.44] community. Our mission is also the same.
[994.48] Give Momna's marriage to me. Okay, let us do one thing. Do you want to do the
[998.32] marriage now or with pomp and show? Right now, we
[1000.08] just have to do the Nikaah. The marriage will be done with pomp and show after the marriage. This is it.
[1002.32] Oh brother,
[1005.44] how are you here and what is all this happening?
[1008.68] Brother, the police have come.

[1062.92] leave me, what have I
[1074.72] done, you people don't need to worry at all, I wish he could do it
[1079.60] and he hadn't gone too far,
[1082.92] but thank God, nothing happened to both of you,
[1086.04] if the police hadn't come, he would have
[1089.20] killed me, thank
[1091.04] God
[1093.24] [Music] those
[1097.12] people who are close to the heart, when
[1101.16] they are taken away from the heart, life becomes
[1104.28] so difficult
[1110.11] [Music]
[1129.28] what's the matter, I'm fine
[1131.64] papa, I need a favor from you, the thing that I am
[1135.60] going to tell you,
[1137.32] only you can understand, what is the
[1139.92] matter, speak clearly, don't ask first,
[1143.16] wow, you are with me, where have I been, I am at Arar uncle's
[1147.60] house, at Arar's house, listen to me completely
[1151.64] once, please after that, whatever decision you
[1154.64] take, I will accept it, but I definitely
[1158.52] want to say that for the first and last time in life,
[1161.72] you need only my support  I
[1164.84] just want to be with you. Tell me the whole story. Is
[1170.24] everything alright there?
[1173.66] [Music]
[1192.38] [Music]
[1197.24] No.
[1204.32] [Music]
[1208.28] [Laughter]
[1212.72] [Music]
[1227.16] Yes,
[1235.36] I am angry with you.
[1239.84] You too left us alone.
[1243.72] I wanted to come to you long ago,
[1248.64] son. But I didn't have the courage.
[1253.24] I did
[1255.40] n't have any words to heal
[1258.24] your wounds.
[1263.16] I thought
[1266.04] that if I come here, you would become more sad.
[1270.68] Thinking this, I
[1273.12] put a stone on my heart.
[1275.28] Baba did not do well to us.
[1281.16] We left you alone.
[1287.04] Aasra
[1289.16] neither said anything nor
[1292.28] listened to anything. He was the same,
[1294.72] son. He who kept his heart in his heart.
[1298.84] I too did not do well to him. I
[1306.76] left him alone in his extremely difficult time. I
[1308.56] wish I had done my duty as a good friend.
[1315.04] But if I ask him for forgiveness now, then
[1317.72] how? Hey, please
[1321.48] forgive me,
[1327.08] Akal, please, why are you asking for forgiveness? It's
[1334.44] not your fault. You have always
[1337.64] tried your best to fulfill your friendship.
[1340.40] Maybe only my Baba's fate was such.
[1343.45] [Music]
[1344.80] When he left this world, no
[1349.24] one from his side could give him forgiveness.  They did
[1351.40] not have their own
[1352.59] [Music]
[1363.30] [Music]
[1364.72] Uncle, why are you putting yourself and me into a test?
[1369.48] If something like this was to happen, it would have happened in Ammi and
[1373.56] Baba's life itself,
[1375.60] son. Don't you see how
[1379.00] nature brings you both in front of each other?
[1382.32] Now look at today's matter. Is
[1385.24] this not a sign from nature?
[1388.92] Uncle, I am happy in your and Baba's happiness.
[1395.72] I have time,
[1398.48] his life, his
[1405.84] future. In fact,
[1408.92] I am now only thinking about Abir's marriage.
[1410.88] Son, Abir's marriage and Sami's
[1413.88] future are not your problems. I
[1417.00] am here to face these problems.
[1419.48] And look son, if Abrar was alive today,
[1424.20] his biggest happiness would have been your and Arham's
[1426.24] marriage. He had made a relationship between you two with a lot of love,
[1429.56] which our idiot has
[1433.80] ruined.
[1440.96] Uncle, now there is no use in these things.
[1444.88] Time has passed
[1449.28] son. If Abrar had desired you
[1452.48] [Music], would
[1453.92] you have refused him?
[1458.24] Look, I am not Abrar,
[1462.72] but I want to pay back my negligence by fulfilling his desire.
[1470.80] Remember
[1473.88] son, if this time passes, there will be
[1478.16] only regrets in both of our lives. Please
[1482.48] why should I feel shy?
[1484.42] [Music]
[1486.12] How will I face your aunty? Trust me
[1491.72] son, I know that the times to come will
[1494.76] not be easy,
[1496.24] but I assure you
[1499.24] that we both will
[1500.40] face this difficulty together and
[1502.84] your aunty
[1504.24] too. [
[1505.69] Music]
[1509.16] Trust Aapi, what are you doing? It's done, it's done
[1512.44] Aapi. Just look at this. I am dying.
[1515.52] You are busy with preparations. Arham
[1518.52] Bhai, for the first time in his life, you have done a
[1520.32] manly thing, so you should get the reward for it. Keep it like this.
[1524.48] Keep it like this.
[1538.24] Mashallah, you are looking cute.
[1544.04] Look up, keep smiling, don't be shy. [
[1560.02] Music] I am
[1567.56] very happy for you. A
[1569.80] person gets life only once
[1572.76] and in this one life, one should do
[1575.64] everything that his heart says. You are
[1579.00] right
[1580.76] friend, but if Papa had not supported me,
[1584.48] maybe I couldn't have done anything.
[1590.08] All this is happening because of Papa.
[1594.06] [Music]
[1602.36] [Praise] [Music] [
[1625.93] Music]
[1632.04] Maybe you can guess.  No, I am getting
[1633.60] desperate to see my penis

[1656.64] I do not like so much bad presumption in life,
[1661.20] sometimes a person has to
[1664.04] take a risk for his happiness,
[1670.68] if you were in my place, then I would
[1676.04] ask you that till date I have lived my whole life either according to
[1679.04] you or according to mama,
[1681.96] see, today for the first time I have taken a decision on my own, so
[1685.68] papa is also with us

[1699.88] told you right now, but after the nika, I will call her first,
[1704.00] mama, I have never lied to her, it was
[1709.04] just mama's wish, so she wanted
[1712.84] me to get married to her
[1716.36] and
[1720.40] now without his consent,
[1724.68] Momina, I do not want to mention anyone in this moment of happiness,
[1731.80] either I am there, you are there
[1735.68] and I do not need anyone's company

[1779.60] beautiful, you will do my work, get me a phone, I will not
[1782.48] use it, get you a
[1785.08] phone, you have lost your mind, I will get you
[1787.84] your phone, you don't have a sister, get me my phone, you have to make one phone call,
[1790.12] look, a woman is useful to a woman,
[1792.64] look, I will do everything for you, whatever you say,

[1826.24] Sajna in Sajna [
[1834.83] Music] what is
[1841.76] this drama,
[1843.16] from where are you people coming and
[1846.80] what are these three doing in my house and
[1849.16] I had told you not to show me
[1850.84] your face again  Show me but you also
[1854.04] need a dose of insult after every two-four days. The
[1856.52] respect of every person is in his own hands.
[1858.64] I did not like this style of yours at all.
[1864.36] Am is saying absolutely right.
[1868.28] These children were not safe in that house, that is why
[1870.88] I have brought them here.
[1872.20] Now I am not such a bad person
[1874.68] that I will spoil my friend's trust.
[1887.24] This is not just your house, it is my house
[1889.08] too. And if your relatives can stay here, then
[1891.64] these children can also stay here
[1893.72] forever.
[1896.72] Afan, you will play such a game with me.
[1900.24] I did not expect this from you. Okay, don't talk useless
[1902.32] things. Go and take rest. Come on,
[1905.64] children, you also take rest. You also come, I will
[1908.60] show you the guest room downstairs. You stay in
[1912.20] this house with these orphans now. But I will
[1915.76] not stay in this house even for a moment. Come on, Fiza, you are
[1919.04] coming with me.
[1920.48] Aunty, what happened? You relax.
[1924.56] Why did you fight with uncle or will you leave your house?
[1927.12] Uncle has only given shelter to these people, is
[1929.84] n't it?
[1932.12] Uncle, who is going to marry Arham Momna?
[1936.24] Right, Momna, am I right?
[1940.24] So I have heard that you are a very self-respecting
[1943.36] and sensible girl. You are
[1946.52] not the kind of girl who will cause any problem between Uncle and Aunty.
[1977.72] Come on,
[1979.44] Momna, there is no personal enmity between you and me. In
[1987.24] fact, I don't even know you. I
[1991.28] heard one thing about you
[1995.40] that Arham was engaged to you before me
[2000.63] [Sangeet]
[2002.84] but I don't care about you because that
[2008.64] engagement was
[2009.92] broken
[2011.77] [laughs]
[2015.16] and you are Arham's past
[2021.72] while I am Arham's
[2026.24] today and Arham's tomorrow
[2029.23] [Sangeet] I
[2032.48] must tell you one thing,
[2038.60] you have earned the right to come to this house
[2042.56] but don't think of doing anything
[2046.92] that shakes the foundation of this house.
[2051.96] You know Aunty gets
[2054.88] very angry
[2058.40] and in anger she even goes a little crazy
[2063.57] [Sangeet], it may happen
[2065.88] that
[2069.48] Aunty harms herself because of you
[2075.12] [Sangeet]
[2077.60] or
[2095.88] us.
[2098.68] I don't know Aunty that much
[2102.08] but
[2104.00] yes, I respect Uncle a lot. I will
[2114.80] not refuse him like my Baba.  I can't say
[2118.52] their happiness lies in the fact that I, Abir and
[2124.24] Sami stay here. For
[2127.80] how
[2129.52] long, I don't
[2133.84] know [Music]
[2136.52] Hey, you are very innocent friend,
[2143.00] Ale, but don't act like this innocence in front of me.
[2148.32] You know very well
[2151.44] what I am trying to explain and tell you. It would be
[2155.80] better for you to
[2158.60] understand
[2160.24] because the uncle you are talking about, no
[2165.08] one in this house listens to him, my
[2170.60] aunty. Without my aunty's signal
[2174.12] even a leaf does not
[2177.36] move in this house. But there are some people like you,
[2181.60] if you want to take support of any helpless wall, then it is
[2187.48] your
[2192.32] wish. No one becomes weak by taking support of one's own people.
[2200.20] When you are not scared of anything, do
[2206.04] n't worry,
[2208.40] I will not come in between uncle and aunty.
