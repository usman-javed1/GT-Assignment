I want peace in this house and I want his health. Hear you both understand that your father is dead, son, what happened to you, my condition is such that my mind goes crazy, but you should control yourself, hey, how should I control myself, I do n't care about anything else, I am only worried about my marriage, you know Atul Bhabhi, if she comes to know, then what will happen, Atul Bhabhi, Atul Bhabhi, Atul Bhabhi, is she God, what will happen if Atul Bhabhi comes to know, she will break the relationship, she will break the relationship, what are these relationships [Music], I want this child's life at any cost, that's all I want [Music] [ Music] [ Laughter] [Music] what's the matter, you all seem quite tensed  Something is going to happen as per your wish, you should be very happy, what do I have to do to be happy, but why do you think that if I am tensed, there will be only one reason for it, it does n't seem so dear, I am reading this sad face of yours, there is only one name written on it, please give time to your son, there is no need to read my face, what has happened to you, both of you do not tolerate each other at all, the problem is not with me, it is with your beloved son, why don't you do one thing, it will be alright if you get him married, but after that he will be of no use to you, I am not going to get him married so soon, but till yesterday, was his marriage too early for you, there is a difference in saying and doing [sangeet], for the first time in life I have seen such parents, strange thinking, at this age the thought of having a son came, whereas at this age one's own life starts feeling like a burden [sangeet], I am hating this son who has not yet come in our life and has made our life hell, please shut up in my head now  There is already a lot of pain, nothing will happen if I keep quiet, but don't react so normally on Arham bhai's silence, what about Amma and Abbu, they have nothing to do with our happiness, they have no need, they are getting their own son who will stay with them all his life, you worry about Arham bhai, call them, what should I tell your Arham bhai, I do n't have any argument to give, there is no time for argument, you love him, right, I can't live without him, you just need to tell and explain, there is no need to argue in love, Aapi, you have a lot of understanding, who talks about these things, no one talks like this to you, but I keep my eyes and ears open, come on, call or talk to him, we must be waiting for Bhai, introduce him right now, you are the one I am saying, come on, on one hand your marriage and on the other hand this child, I am not able to digest this, how should I explain to Mama, if we and you what you want is not possible, earlier there was so much tension going on in our house about all this, but Baba also got very hyper, said Amma  She hasn't eaten anything since last night. It is not right to take tension in this situation. She cannot take stress. So I want to end this tension. I know that as the pressure increases, the problem will increase for her. I have a friend, her mother is a very good gynaecologist. Listen to me. She can help us. Please tell her to meet her once. She knows her mother and I know that she will handle my situation comfortably. Amma will not go to the gynaecologist. Why won't she go? She won't go for our happiness. Is n't it about our happiness? It is about Baba's wish. He is going to be a father. He wants a son at any cost. And if we force him too much, he will take Amma with him and leave from here. He has said [sangeet] what happened. Uncle will behave like this at this age. I could never have imagined. He should have taken Aunty to the doctor at that time itself when he came to know about all this.  What all does not happen these days, Baba, sometimes I have to say that what cannot happen, for them all this is no less than a sock, this is definitely strange, but perhaps the desire for a son was much more than the love for daughters, this middle class thinking, daughters do not earn money, so we want a son, he will become a support, he will earn money and give, this is too much [Sangeet], you will see, this child will become a source of happiness for you people [Sangeet], your life is at stake for both of you, I have no control over it, I will do anything and this innocent's life should not be put in such a test, you tell me what should I do, aunty, why are you talking like this, this test is not just for you, you know uncle better than me, I cannot change his thinking, this is a very awkward situation for me and for Momna as well, please understand this as well, I do not deny anything you say [Sangeet] son, but the decisions of life and death are not in the hands of man [Sangeet], know one thing Son, if the fate of this child is my lap, then I cannot change his fate [Music] [Praise] [Music] Aunty has given her decision, now you just pray that the fate of this child does not clash with our fate, otherwise I will lose you [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh, you are not being too serious about that girl, there are only a few days left for the wedding, what is the need to do Nikaah, I think it is their planning and middle class thinking, Mama, but what is your problem in this, of course we will get married after some time, I am not in any hurry for the marriage, it is becoming so difficult for them to organize the wedding event and you are putting another expense on their shoulders by doing Nikaah, I feel that maybe our future daughter-in-law is not giving much lift to our son these days, that is why he is in a hurry, am I right, no Papa, there is nothing like that, actually I want to apply for a visa for myself and Momna for father studies  So marriage is necessary for her. So such long term planning has been done. I had told you that the girl and her family are smarter than I thought. By the way, what other methods of taking shortcuts are they teaching you? No, no, there is no such thing. Then you should also see that you will get a chance to celebrate this marriage twice. Have you ever taken anything seriously in your life? [Sangeet] If it's your brother's call, I will talk to you later. Hello Aaya. Now tell me why do you want to get married. I had told your mother to put forward her point. Tell me the truth. What should I tell you papa? Shagufta aunty, what are you? Aunty Shagufta aunty is pregnant. I did not expect such audacity from you. Yaar, you are going to get your daughter married and on the other hand, your wife is going to become a mother. Have fear of God, yaar. And on top of that, you are saying with great pride that I am going to be the father of a son. What should I do if he grows up at this age? At this age Allah is showering his blessings on me, so how can I not be thankful to him friend, friend, I wish Allah had showered his blessings on me when you both husband and wife were of the age to raise a child, now at this age you have put her in trouble, look at the child, marriage of a daughter is a big responsibility, what all will she do in a year and then the world will say 10 different things, well leave these things and tell me whether we can get Arham and Momna married after Shagufta's delivery, friend, you have completely lost your mind, I swear by God brother, I want the marriage to happen right now, today itself, you don't know my wife, friend, tomorrow she will create 10 fuss, friend, what about Atul Bhabhi, she can create a problem even on a small matter, I have to see my wife too, the doctor has asked her to take complete bed rest, her blood pressure becomes high, in these conditions how can I involve her in the wedding work, anything can be harmful, you are understanding what I am saying, right friend, I am good  I am understanding this way but your mind has gone to waste. Hey brother, Aram also wants that this Nikah should happen first. The marriage will happen later when the situation gets better. At least the Nikah should happen now. You are right. I am ready for Nikah. Whenever you say this, friend, your son is more intelligent than you. Thank God, you also get your senses and understand things. Sometimes, friend, I have been explaining to you for two hours. I had already told you that Sh Gupta's pregnancy is not normal. I am trying to normalize the stress hormones from day one but I am not able to understand what is going on with her? What is the problem [Music] Doctor sahab, I take a lot of care of her. Perhaps, I think that she is upset because of her daughter's marriage. My advice is that you please postpone the marriage because the mother and the child are underweight and I cannot give them a heavy dose. It has side effects. The child 's life can be in danger. The mother's life can be in danger. Currently, I am putting her on light tablets.  etc. I am giving it to you in writing, you get it started, you people, the whole family should take care of them, they need your attention, they need the attention of the family, yes Doctor Saba, thank you very much, come on, let's go slowly, you sit, I will come, we are walking slowly [Sangeet] no [Sangeet] I feel that Abdul Bhabhi has seen us, I don't want to face him in this condition, yes, please take me from here quickly, we are walking, you take some rest while sitting here, you are behaving as if you have seen a ghost, not Atul Bhabhi, will you leave the city out of fear of Atul Bhabhi, if it were up to me, I would leave this world itself, first of all you mother and daughter, I don't know why you are hell-bent on troubling me, okay, I will get them checked up, come with me [Sangeet] [Sangeet] I had advised you to meet Doctor Jiya, so I am giving you some tests in writing, so please get these tests done [Sangeet] I think Ammi should wear this saree in the wedding, for this  There is work on the pallu as well, this is good and decent. Look, in this condition, the saree will not look good on Ammi. Why are you trying to make fun of yourself and her? What happened to Ammi? In fact, now she has become even more weak. She will look good, smart. I don't know. You look at her [ Sangeet], [Sangeet] The silence of both of you forces me to scream. Why are you treating me like an untouchable? [Sangeet] Both of you have made me a fool for my whole life. And what was the flaw in my love that your respect has decreased? No Ammi, there is nothing like that [Sangeet] There is no flaw in your love [ Sangeet] and neither can our respect ever decrease. It has just increased so rapidly that I cannot understand what to talk to you. I don't even want to do this Nikah, not at all. Now see, you should rest in this condition and you are sitting here upset because of me [Sangeet] Now I would also go, your Nikah should happen as soon as possible, you should become a part of your home.  My heart should be satisfied son, I got a call from Amal Bhabhi. She has invited us all to her house for dinner yesterday and has specially asked you to come. She has invited everyone. I mean, she has invited me as well. Yes, it's a family dinner, so obviously everyone has been invited. We have n't agreed. Whatever happens will be seen. Amma, you wear that green silk suit of yours. Its dupatta is big and its stitching is such that it doesn't feel felt. [Music] 20 years ago, you both gave me the happiness of becoming a mother. It was so priceless that it always kept me brave. But son, becoming a mother is not an easy thing. One has to listen to big things. Now if someone says something, I will not break his face and then I will ask him, tell me, what is that work which sons can do and daughters cannot. Amma, today I will myself cook food of your choice for you. [Music] Do you feel like eating something special? Do n't you son? Don't give me something to eat? [Music] I go [ Laughter] [Music ] By the way, I, no, Aram Bhai, have agreed with you. Where are you going for your individual studies, how much will you take for keeping quiet? You have a knack of surprising our wife, by the way, I think that now the snow has started melting on the mountains, she has arranged all this feast, for the happiness of her son, she can do anything, you are absolutely right, I can do anything for the happiness of my son, but I cannot tolerate the lies of Abrar and Shagufta, which lie, so you knew this beforehand that a support for old age is going to be born in old age, wow, Phansa, very good, by the way, you have kept the secret of your friend very well, for this you should get the Ejaz Shield, and Shagufta, if you were not so sad, then why do you hide this act from me, right, Mama, please, he is our guest, you will not say a single word, oh, how a guest is respected in my house, it is not you, I have always done it and even today I will do it, Bhabhi, today the respect that you have shown us by calling us here  I have done great honour to you, I will always remember this, making a spectacle of someone's life and being happy after that, if this is not a mental disease then what is it, but you have always had this problem, come on, wait a minute, Abra, I will tell you what is called a mental patient, normal people do not wish to have a child at the marriageable age, they want a son at any cost, this mental disorder is in the genes of people like you, stop it, I knew it, yes, you always knew everything, still you have brought this small family and made them sit at par with you, what will people say, what will people say, Afan sahab, does this happen in respectable families, they will say to you that Arham's mother-in-law has gone for delivery, disgusting, there is a time for every work, I am not surprised but I am getting terrified thinking about it, Bhabhi, I wanted to tell you but I did not have the courage, your anger is absolutely justified, absolutely my anger is justified, but this child of yours does not seem justified to me [music] because you were denying its existence, you wanted that your daughter  So that the marriage does not get postponed, you are very intelligent, Shata Mama, please stop what are you saying, I knew that aunty is pregnant, why are you blaming her, everyone knew it, but I did not know, if you were so intelligent, you would never have got your relationship done with lowly people, while getting into a relationship, you would have at least thought about your social status, will you stop, please Ami is getting unwell, please be quiet, call an ambulance and take this problem away from here, if you had fixed the relationship within the family, then we would not have had to see this day, listen to me, I have seen how well man and well mannered you are and you will have to answer for this rudeness, if something happens to my mother, I will not leave you alive, stop it Abhir, you cannot talk to my Mama like this, why, your Mama has respect and my Mama has no respect, we will all keep listening and tolerating, no, brother, one should talk to him as he is, beware, if you called him brother, he is not a brother, he is your brother, remember your status, Allah's Regarding this, everyone should be quiet. Someone call an ambulance. Please take out the car. Please Mummy's health is very bad. Please please go quickly, friend. Go quickly [Music] Excuse [Music] I'm doctor, without saying anything seriously. I am disturbing you right now, but the condition of your patient, Mrs. Abrar, is not good at all. Her abdominal movements have started. There are chances of premature delivery. Oho, what we were afraid of has happened. You should shift her to the OT. Please keep checking her BP as well. Okay, I will come just now. Okay, okay. Excuse me, doctor, how is Mummy? A surgery will have to be done. The patient needs blood. Please contact the blood bank. Thank you. What did you say? Mummy was in her seventh month, so what did you forget? Maybe a premature birth is going to happen. The doctor had forbidden it. He had told Mummy to take bed rest. But we did not take care of her at all. [Music] Bir, all this has happened because of Amtula aunty, how can someone be so cruel? I have started hating her face. Why, how is aunty's health? What did the doctor say [Music] that blood is needed, the blood has gone back, but I don't know what will happen. I don't understand anything. We have already discussed this. Earlier, I thought pre-term birth is a normal thing at this age. [Music] Now I'm really sorry, he was just angry. [Music] So pray for mummy. [Music] [Praise] [Music] In premature delivery, there is a risk to the life of both the mother and the child, so why are you telling me this? I know that normal delivery does not happen at this age. If you knew, then what was the need to call them to your house and insult them like this. I don't know why you are so angry with those husband and wife. It is their fault, isn't it that they are the parents of the daughter who likes your son? This is not a small mistake Afan sahab, he took advantage of my innocence and simplicity. Whatever insult was to happen in my circle was bound to happen, but I don't understand the motive of you people to hide this matter. By the way, I learned to make a mountain out of a molehill from you. Brother, you punished her, you sent her to the operation table, and what do you want? And then becoming a mother at this age is not such a big deal that you make it such a big issue. You are making it an issue. If it were up to me, I would banish them from the city. I have never seen a liar and small person like Abrar in my entire life. Thankfully, everything came to light before Arham's marriage. This is too much Afan, you also kept me in the dark [Music] Shata is bleeding a lot. We will need more blood. Please arrange it. I am unable to stop her bleeding. Doctor, the patient's blood pressure is getting very high. 170. Please arrange the blood [Music] Can you take it quickly? [Music] [ Music] [Music] Call Doctor Rashid.  Baby's lungs are affected and get the incubator ready as well [Music] How is the saturation going on [Music] 75 [Music] [ Music] Shaq [Music] Shaq Shaqta what have you done, what have you done Ammi Ammi Ammi [ Music] Ammi she gave her life for my happiness, my wish Ami laga
