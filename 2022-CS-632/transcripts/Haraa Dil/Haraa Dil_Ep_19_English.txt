Haara dil sajana ve Haara dil sajana ve Sajana why don't you smile on seeing someone come on, smile by the way everyone saw us together yesterday but we didn't see how we look with each other [Music] you are very relaxed na and here you are standing on the bed of my love why do you mean why if we come then it will be a disaster my please so what happened see who saw you yesterday it is possible that Mama has brought a surprise for you it is possible that she will happily accept it you have to be positive no instead of being suspicious it is better to be positive and think Sami is feeling sleepy I have to put him to sleep you go ok he suddenly fell asleep friend you have come between us right now I will take revenge from you when we grow up he is not between us he is with us so what is the difference between these two things there is a lot of difference if you understand then this is the truth of my life if you ever feel that an idol is being made on you then tell me I will take him away from here and go far away  I want to share it but I do n't want to become a burden on anyone Momina, there is a limit to being proud and depressed, friend I don't want to discuss this topic with you right now If I ever run away from my responsibilities, then you should complain to me, you start talking all the time, friend and hum ah hum, I did n't mean that [Music] Please [Music] Good morning [Music] Wait, why are you coming from there so early in the morning, did you spend the whole night with her? Don't talk nonsense to me, it's not nonsense, yarham, after seeing everything with my own eyes, I have the right to ask, right? Look, tell me the truth, what is going on between you and the girl, listen Fiza, I have not given you any such right that you can ask any question about my coming and going or my getting up and sitting down I think you are going for a walk, do n't waste my time, you are wasting my time, aren't you, in this coming and going, I do n't understand, Arham, what are you afraid of, why don't you agree, Fiza, what's the matter, why are you so tense and  What are you doing here Arham? Will this drama happen in front of the servants of this house now? When the servants of the house are given importance then there will be drama, Aunty. Mind and language. Are you both fighting like traps? You have created a mess in the whole atmosphere of the house. Let's go inside and talk. No, Aunty, the talk will happen here. In fact, why don't we go outside that room and talk. Where Arham spent the night? Aunty, you ask him. You will have to ask Arham today that what does he want? Who is he cheating? Me or himself. Mamma listen to me [Music] Mamma, my mind [Praise] [Music] At last, you tell me today that why have you left your house and are lying here and why are you ruining the peace of my house? You, yes, yes, tell me. I want to hear when will you leave this guest room of mine [Music] As soon as you find Baba's killer, we will leave from here. We are already indebted to you a lot. We will not take any further favors. Who will stay here for how long and who will go away from here. I think about this.  It is better if papa takes the decision. Your papa has never understood anything in his entire life. If you just cry in front of him, he becomes mom. Now, because of Momna, the misunderstanding that has started between you and Fiza, he will never understand this. Yes, but if you spend the whole night in this room, then this kind of reaction will come. That is why I want these people to leave from here as soon as possible and you give time to prepare for your wedding. For god's sake, mamma, I was not in her room for the whole night. You are also getting influenced by Fiza's words. Son, it becomes difficult to deny what the eyes see. And we are respectable people, if we do not react, then who else will? Aunty, you do not get a certificate of being respectable by insulting someone else. [Music] Mamma, come now. You are getting late for the walk. Let me also go. Come, please, you are still very young. Such big things do not suit you. Son, have you seen the harm in talking to small people? There is no respect for elders.  And there is no shame in the eyes, so tell me why the police is not arresting Kas, why is there so much delay, what is the problem, after all, if there is any issue, then tell me I want these people to leave from here as soon as possible, I will not tolerate these people anymore [Music] Kassi [Music] Kasadan why does it seem like uncle Kasadan [ Music] Oh, is this tea or muddy rain water, I did not drink it, O Allah, who cast an evil eye on my good days, who ate me [Music] Children of life, Allah asks you, my life was ruined, you have ruined mine too, now good news for you, the police has arrested Kas and his entire gang, Faraz, are you saying the truth, O Allah, I am thankful to you a million times, you have no idea what a big news you have told me, I will go and tell you right now and I will be very happy to hear it, okay then come on video call, let me also see your happiness, what nonsense, thank you so much, I will never forget this favor of yours and if life ever gives me a chance, then I will definitely take back this revenge  You are not ungrateful or you have returned the favor, thank you, by saying such words you are neither insulting my feelings nor are you able to say such difficult things, it does not suit you at all, I am not joking and I am not in a mood to joke either and you should listen to one thing carefully, in future you will not talk to me in such a tone, are you understanding or not, you did not understand, what can you do, hello, whose anger is this that is being expressed on the cell phone of this poor innocent, mama, are you that person in your son's life who keeps on making me angry all the time, do I know her, no, you do not know her yet, but after today you would like to know her, what should I understand, you are not wanting to tell me or I have come to know about this beautiful love story by chance, well, leave this matter, tell me since when has all this been going on, mama, what happened to your pressure, okay, what kind of questions have you started asking her, we are typical  Brothers with women, while sitting, sit and talk, Baba must have forgiven me, right? He will not be angry with me, he must be remembering my deeds in the name of Allah Maya, and you know, he must be saying to Ammi, your daughter is like this, not like that, Aapi, are you mad? Today, his soul must have found peace, you have fulfilled the right of being his daughter [Music] Aapi, now this is the last day of these tears in our eyes, now neither you are sick, nor I [Music], no one will cry, then I was thinking that I should talk to Faraz, thank him and also meet his mother, now we should meet, no Aapi, if she also turns out like Amtula aunty [Music], then yes, this is hot, you turn out like aunty, then it is fine, then she is happy in her home and we are in our home [Music], and Aapi, you know, you are laughing like this after months, you also make fun of me, I had heard that sisters change after marriage, but today I have seen it as well, well, if Madam permits,  If yes, can I talk to Faraz sahab? Aabhi, you are very bad friend, this is a big tragedy with those people, I am very sorry, where are they, do they not have any relatives in this whole city, uncle, there is a bigger tragedy than this, actually Aabir's elder sister got married to Arham Afan, is that girl Atul Afan's daughter-in-law? Oh, not my daughter-in-law, his elder sister is his daughter-in-law, yes, yes, I am talking about that, wow Faraz, wow, what a work you have done in Essence, you liked the only girl in this whole city who is Atul's relative, and what do you want now that I should go there with your proposal, what do I want, even I do n't know, and whatever happened to me in your absence, but uncle, whatever I felt in my heart about Abir, I have shared it with you, and yes, one more thing Faraz, why don't you tell me everything at once, Aafan uncle is ready for this marriage, but Atul aunty does n't know anything about it, she is not even aware of it.  Aaram wants to get married somewhere else Atul doesn't know about this Nikaah how can this be possible it's so surprising and more than that because of another surprise we had just met and after that all this happened mama you will take my marriage proposal right I know you don't like this whole connection but what should I do it's not my fault right now I have to go to that house with the marriage proposal you tell Abir we are coming to meet him very soon mama very good I love you come come come little Brar Mashallah how naughty has become like father uncle baba and naughty you know he is the most playful child in the world you don't know how playful and mischievous your father was what is the use of such childhood Shati Arham how far have your marriage preparations reached [music] Afan I was thinking that the issue which was there is over now these people have come here let's do this let's send them back to their home because now there is no time for marriage  Guests will definitely come and we will need a guest room for them I was thinking of getting the guest room renovated and also change some settings what do you say I had already told you and listen again these two girls will now stay here in this house by the way aunty I can help you in setting up the guest room you are wanting to get renewed for Arham bhai's wedding [Music] [Praise] [Music] yes Arham bhai please pass the slate [Music] you guys were getting it done how will I walk from here I will have to climb up quickly what happened son how did you get hurt oh that aunty we all were dancing together with great joy during that time her foot slipped and she got hurt aunty I know that I had angered you and Aram and left that's why this happened to me you must be feeling a lot of pain come I will take you to the doctor the wedding is near and you have sat down after getting hurt you also don't come no aunty why are you getting worried is there less tension in this house first I will handle ok Fiza I will leave you take me till I relax  Do it, it's okay and by morning your pain will be over, but aunty don't worry at all, it will be completely fine by the wedding and anyway, thankfully it's a muscle injury, so you can go. [Sangeet] It's okay, you too, son, don't listen to elders, this is what happens [Sangeet] come and I know this way, only you can leave me, if aunty sees me, then you will scold me, so listen to me, can't a man be even a little close to his wife, no, you know, I do n't like all this at all, but since then we are living here by lying to Atul aunty, I am already scared that the day she will get to know, how hurt she will be, let's do one thing, tell Mama that I am married to you, now I am not with you again but want to marry you, have I gone mad, yes, and you have forced me to go mad by talking so innocently, now a man is a human being, if he doesn't change, what else will he do, if this man is a human being, it would be better if he stays a little conscious, I know how scared you are.  I am going through the most beautiful phase of my life The feeling of being with you The feeling of being with you is very satisfying for me And I am going through the most difficult phase of my life [Sangeet] Give me all your sorrows [Sangeet] Give me this much right Remove all the fear from your heart Whatever happens tomorrow I am always with you Remember this If you guys allow me, I can come inside Because Sami and I are tired of doing guard duty outside Please please come Thank you Now I have brought something for you too Check it out Yes Yes Areeez How is it Wow it is very nice The colour will look good It will suit me a lot [Sangeet] Hey Atul How are you fine It seems you guys are quite busy What a beautiful dress Did you guys not finish your shopping even after the wedding By the way many many congratulations for Haram's wedding You did not invite anyone to the wedding But look we still got to know By the way I wanted to come to your house To meet your daughter-in-law My house Yes Do you not know about Momna and Arham's wedding But  Afan bhai was involved in it and Faraz was a witness to the marriage. He likes doing such good deeds [Music] Faiz aunty you might have misunderstood. What are you saying, Hareez. Why would I have misunderstood? You both are at fault, Faiza bhabhi. Look, I wanted to come to your house after burying all my grievances and talk to Arham and Momna about Abir's relationship. And the thing is that Abir and Faraz like each other very much, and I also don't have any objection. I am very happy in my daughter's happiness. I believe that one should never impose one's choice on one's children, otherwise the consequences of such a secret marriage are as a result [Music] By the way, when are you people telling about your marriage, it depends on Faan uncle. Maybe he is waiting for a suitable time. The suitable time is not waited for, a ground is prepared for that. Where is the talk of preparing the ground going on? Talks of preparing the ground are going on in your house. In my house. And I was asking that you people  Why don't you tell Amtula aunty about your marriage? I think as time passes and she comes to know, she will be very upset [Sangeet] [Sangeet] Yes, you called me. Yes, I called you. I wanted to ask you whether you have just got married or things have gone beyond marriage. Amma, what kind of questions are you asking me? The question is very simple. If you are giving me an answer, then give it, otherwise I will call your beloved wife and get the answer. See, so much sarcasm in your tone, so lame, does n't look good. Mama, whatever you want to ask, ask me clearly. Come, I will tell you myself. Yes, I have married Momna and there is no crime in this. I did not want to marry Fiza. I had told you earlier also. I will say the same thing even now [Sangeet] So this is your final decision. You know, I always fulfill my commitment. Okay, you fulfill your commitment. I have also made a promise to myself. And I fulfill that promise. And you fulfill your promise. You can go [Sangeet] ho [sangeet] [praise] I could not even imagine that Mama would react like this I found her behaviour very strange I mean I thought that maybe she would shout at us and throw us both out of this house but she did not do anything like that this is probably the silence before the storm she could have thrown me and Abir out of the house by pushing us but she did not say anything her silence might be causing more pain to her I work I will tell Papa to talk to Mama she can handle her [sangeet] while doing Arham's Nikaah you neither thought about my wishes nor my happiness you did not even bother to ask me and not only this you made that girl the bride of my son and brought her to my house and I did not even get to know people from outside are coming and congratulating me they are taunting me without any reason wow wow Phan sahab wow what a friendship you have maintained with your Abrar [sangeet] if your Arham would have done this to me I would have understood but you lied to me  I kept you in the dark If your conversation is over then let me say something The conversation you have started now will not end so easily Afan sahab, you and Arham together have played a big game with me I had only heard about Jaadu Tony I feel that before dying Abrar made both of you drink such a talisman that even after all this his daughter's ghost has not left your heads I wish I too could get such a talisman that I can make you drink by fooling you so that your thinking changes When will my thinking not change ok then don't change but remember your stubbornness will take your son very far from you hey I have returned your son to you otherwise he would have left you long ago remember he is your son he will also do only what comes to his heart ok Afan sahab, not till now but now I will do only what my heart desires [Music] Papa I'm everything is alright I talked to your mother, what did she say friend I have not understood your mother till date, there is so much freshness in her words  It is found that I don't understand what to believe, whom to believe, I think I should talk to Mama myself [Sangeet] Her silence is bothering me, I shouldn't remain silent for so long, ah, leave it my friend, everything will be fine with time, we are married, so she will have to accept it, you go to Momna right now, she needs this, go and explain to her that trust in Allah, everything will be fine, Ishala Tala, Papa keeps explaining to me, but still I don't know why she is so scared of Mama, what is the problem of these two, actually your mother's obesity is so big and obesity is such a disease for which no one has any cure, you are not getting serious even today, Papa, this has become a question of my life, and if I get serious, will Atul accept this relationship [Sangeet] no, we are already married, she doesn't have any other option, this is the only thing I want to explain to Mama, I have explained as much as I could, now let her understand on her own, you go to Momna [Sangeet] what no, you are joking  ho [sangeet] no I can't do this how can Aram get married I can talk to aunty and do it but now there's no use what he says the arrow has left the bow you are talking nonsense you help me take me to aunty's room this is of no use now he is neither in the mood to listen to anything nor to do anything at this time you do one thing take rest right now you can talk to me in the morning should I rest how can I rest in such a situation I want to talk right now I ca n't wait for the morning he was ignoring me he was cheating so much [sangeet] how can he do this to me he can do anything for Momina I had told you it's not that easy to make a place in Aram's heart he is ready to leave this house for Momina are you ready to leave mama [sangeet] I am gone you don't hold any importance for him [ sangeet] I am having a headache please go from here by the way now you should just take rest [sangeet] yes brother its good you called me to so many agencies I was about to go for a meeting Afan sahab this work is more important than your meeting and I want this work to be finished today itself [sangeet] yes, tell me what's the work [sangeet] ah Afan sahab so this matter is between me and you and the principles should be between me and you only but you and your son have been breaking the principles and laws of this house for the last few months so it doesn't matter to me what is good and what is bad going to happen in this house I assure you that from today whatever will happen in this house will be seen only as per your wish forget what has passed if this union was not in the fate of these two then their marriage would never have happened Afan sahab the fate of these two is written by you only to defeat me, to hurt my pride or maybe to take revenge for the decision taken in the past all the decisions taken in this house before today were all for your happiness if I had ever stopped you till today you would have stopped me you didn't stop me at that time you are a man otherwise you have attacked me very intelligently in front of my son  I did not leave anything worth saying, what nonsense are you saying, Mama, please listen to me, if you want to get angry, scold me, you can scold me, but don't say these things, no, I have lost the right to say anything, a son always belongs to his father and you have already proved it, Mama, there is no such thing, please try to understand, I could not tell you in that situation, and you told dad, in this way, the relationship between you two has become strong, but my relationship with your dad has ended [Music] Aunty, these are the khula papers, if you want, you can end this matter at home itself, and if you don't do that, then I will have to go to court to get khula from you [Music], she can go to any extent to give life to her stubbornness, but I will not be happy with both of you under any circumstances, this is my promise to you, then only one person can be happy in this house, either this or that [Music]
