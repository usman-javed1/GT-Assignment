[51.24] brought a surprise for you it is

[88.60] idol is being made on you then tell me I will
[91.52] take him away from here and go far away  I
[94.64] want to share it but I do
[97.68] n't want to become a burden on anyone
[99.44] Momina, there is a limit to being proud and depressed,
[105.16] friend I don't want to discuss this topic with you right now If
[107.52] I ever
[109.88] run away from my responsibilities, then you should complain to me, you

[115.04] n't mean that
[116.61] [Music]
[118.84] Please
[126.07] [Music]
[144.60] Good morning
[147.29] [Music]
[148.76] Wait, why are you coming from there so early in the morning, did
[156.20] you spend the whole night with her? Don't talk nonsense to me, it's
[158.36] not nonsense, yarham, after seeing everything with my own eyes, I
[161.60] have the right to ask, right?
[167.20] Look, tell me the truth, what is going on between you and the girl,
[170.12] listen Fiza,
[173.56] I have not given you any such right
[175.88] that you can
[178.04] ask any question about my coming and going or my getting up and sitting down I
[180.60] think you are going for a walk, do
[182.96] n't waste my time, you are wasting my time, aren't you,
[185.16] in this coming and going, I do
[189.52] n't understand, Arham, what are you afraid of,
[191.48] why don't you agree,
[193.64] Fiza, what's the matter, why are you so tense
[197.72] and  What are you doing here Arham? Will
[200.40] this drama happen in front of the servants of this house now?
[204.40] When the servants of the house are given importance then there will be
[207.12] drama, Aunty. Mind and
[210.76] language. Are you both fighting like traps? You have created a mess in the
[212.76] whole atmosphere of the house. Let's
[215.44] go inside and talk. No, Aunty, the talk will happen
[218.32] here. In fact,
[219.56] why don't we
[222.24] go outside that room and talk. Where Arham spent the night?
[227.16] Aunty, you ask him. You will have to ask Arham today
[231.56] that what does he want?
[233.68] Who is he cheating?
[236.24] Me
[238.68] or himself.
[245.08] Mamma listen to me
[248.50] [Music]
[263.60] Mamma, my
[268.60] mind
[270.32] [Praise]
[271.37] [Music] At
[278.92] last, you tell me today that why have you left your house and are
[282.48] lying here and
[285.16] why are you ruining the peace of my house?
[287.48] You, yes, yes, tell me. I want to hear
[292.28] when will you leave this guest room of mine
[295.22] [Music]
[298.56] As soon as you find Baba's killer, we will
[301.20] leave from here. We are
[302.96] already indebted to you a lot. We will
[305.72] not
[307.16] take any further favors. Who will stay here for how long and who will go away from here. I
[309.84] think about this.  It is
[312.44] better if papa takes the decision. Your papa has never
[315.24] understood anything in his entire life. If you
[317.52] just cry in front of him, he becomes
[320.20] mom. Now, because of Momna, the
[324.40] misunderstanding that has started between you and Fiza, he will
[327.04] never understand this.
[330.84] Yes, but if you spend the whole night in this room,
[335.48] then this kind of reaction will
[340.32] come. That is why I want
[343.04] these people to leave from here as soon as possible and you
[345.52] give time to prepare for your wedding. For god's sake, mamma,
[347.92] I was not in her room for the whole night.
[349.72] You are also getting influenced by Fiza's words. Son, it becomes
[351.72] difficult to deny what the eyes see.
[354.92] And we are respectable people, if we do not
[358.64] react, then who else will?
[360.80] Aunty, you do
[363.40] not get a certificate of being respectable by insulting someone else.
[366.00] [Music]
[367.72] Mamma, come now. You are getting late for the walk.
[371.04] Let me also go. Come, please, you are still very young.
[373.56] Such big things do not suit you.
[378.72] Son, have you seen the harm in talking to small people? There is
[383.92] no respect for elders.  And there is no
[388.40] shame in the eyes,
[390.88] so tell me why the police is not arresting Kas,
[394.24] why is there so much delay,
[395.72] what is the problem, after all, if there is any issue, then
[399.44] tell me I want these people to leave from
[402.04] here as soon as possible, I will not tolerate these people anymore
[406.36] [Music]
[418.40] Kassi
[419.43] [Music]
[423.80] Kasadan why does it seem like uncle
[426.28] Kasadan [
[427.32] Music]
[454.36] Oh, is
[456.16] this tea or muddy rain
[461.04] water, I did not
[465.36] drink it, O Allah, who cast an evil eye on my good days,
[468.80] who ate me
[473.85] [Music]
[475.32] Children of life, Allah asks you, my
[479.80] life was ruined, you have ruined mine too,
[482.52] now good news for you, the police has
[485.76] arrested Kas and his entire gang,
[488.52] Faraz, are you saying the truth, O
[490.92] Allah, I am thankful to you a million times,
[494.96] you have no idea what a
[496.76] big news you have told me, I will go and tell you right now
[499.40] and I will be very happy to hear it, okay then
[502.32] come on video call, let me also see
[504.36] your
[505.48] happiness, what nonsense,
[509.80] thank you so much, I will never forget this favor of yours
[513.44] and if life ever gives me a chance, then I will
[516.48] definitely take back this revenge  You are not
[519.40] ungrateful or you have returned the favor,
[523.96] thank you, by saying such words you are neither
[527.28] insulting my feelings nor are you able to say
[530.08] such difficult
[532.36] things, it does not suit you at all, I am not joking
[535.08] and I am not in a mood to joke either
[537.60] and you should listen to one thing carefully, in future you will
[543.04] not talk to me in such a tone, are you understanding or not, you did not
[544.80] understand, what can you do,
[554.92] hello, whose anger is this that is being
[559.36] expressed on the cell phone of this poor innocent, mama, are
[563.40] you that person in your son's life who
[572.40] keeps on making me angry all the time, do I know her, no,
[577.88] you do not know her yet, but after today
[580.60] you would like to know her, what should I understand, you are
[584.28] not wanting to tell me or I have come to know about this beautiful
[587.04] love story by chance,
[589.16] well, leave this matter, tell me since when has
[592.04] all this been going on, mama, what happened to your pressure,
[594.16] okay, what kind of questions have you
[596.20] started asking her, we are typical  Brothers with women, while sitting,
[598.20] sit and talk,
[601.56] Baba must have forgiven me,
[605.12] right? He will not be angry with me, he must be
[612.40] remembering my deeds in the name of Allah Maya, and you know, he must be
[616.84] saying to Ammi,
[620.08] your daughter is like this, not like that,
[623.24] Aapi, are you mad?
[626.56] Today, his soul must have found peace,
[630.84] you have fulfilled the right of being his daughter
[635.35] [Music]
[638.16] Aapi, now this is the last day of these tears
[643.00] in our eyes, now neither you are sick, nor I
[646.29] [Music], no
[651.16] one will
[655.64] cry,
[658.04] then
[660.36] I was thinking that I should talk to Faraz,
[663.60] thank him
[666.12] and also meet his mother,
[668.84] now we should meet,
[672.28] no Aapi,
[675.28] if she also turns out like Amtula aunty
[678.21] [Music],
[687.96] then
[689.56] yes, this is hot, you turn out like aunty, then it is
[700.76] fine, then she is happy in her home and we are in
[705.16] our home
[710.04] [Music],
[717.96] and
[720.36] Aapi, you know, you are laughing like this after months,
[726.56] you also make fun of me, I had
[730.96] heard that sisters change after marriage,
[734.32] but today I have seen it as well,
[737.96] well, if Madam permits,  If yes, can
[742.68] I talk to Faraz sahab? Aabhi,
[747.88] you are very bad friend,
[750.52] this is a big tragedy with those people, I am
[754.12] very sorry, where are they, do they
[758.80] not have any relatives in this whole city,
[760.88] uncle, there is a bigger tragedy than this,
[763.88] actually Aabir's elder sister got
[768.76] married to Arham Afan, is
[776.52] that girl
[779.68] Atul Afan's daughter-in-law? Oh,
[782.48] not my daughter-in-law, his elder sister is his daughter-in-law, yes,
[786.44] yes, I am talking about that, wow Faraz,
[791.12] wow, what a work you have done in Essence,
[794.92] you liked the only girl in this whole city
[799.16] who is Atul's relative, and what do
[803.28] you want now that I should go there with your proposal,
[806.12] what do I want, even I do
[809.64] n't know, and whatever happened to me in your absence, but
[812.76] uncle,
[817.16] whatever I felt in my heart about Abir, I have
[818.72] shared it with you,
[820.68] and yes, one more thing
[827.72] Faraz, why don't you tell me everything at once,
[830.64] Aafan uncle is ready for this marriage,
[833.80] but Atul aunty does
[836.96] n't know anything about it, she is not even aware of it.  Aaram wants to get married somewhere else
[843.88] Atul doesn't know about this Nikaah
[847.76] how can this be possible it's so surprising and
[852.20] more than that
[867.68] because of another surprise we had just
[870.92] met and after that all this happened
[875.72] mama you will take my marriage proposal right I
[880.00] know you don't like this whole connection
[882.80] but what should I do it's
[885.76] not my fault right

[893.48] marriage proposal

[944.40] issue which was there is over now

[952.08] send them back to their home
[954.52] because now there is no time for marriage  Guests will definitely come and we will

[962.12] and also change some settings what do you
[964.48] say I had already told you and
[969.20] listen again these two girls will now stay here
[980.72] in this house by the way aunty I can help you in setting up the

[1055.76] take you to the doctor the wedding is near
[1058.64] and you have sat down after getting hurt you also don't

[1082.84] you can go.
[1086.99] [Sangeet] It's okay,
[1090.24] you too, son, don't listen to elders,
[1093.80] this is what happens
[1096.09] [Sangeet]
[1107.32] come
[1109.52] and I know this way, only you
[1111.68] can leave me, if aunty sees me, then
[1114.12] you will scold me, so listen to me, can't a
[1118.44] man be even a little close to his wife, no,
[1121.64] you know, I do
[1123.92] n't like all this at all, but since then we are
[1126.76] living here by lying to Atul aunty, I am already
[1128.44] scared that the
[1131.12] day she will get to know,
[1132.28] how hurt she will be, let's do
[1134.96] one thing, tell Mama that
[1138.08] I am married to you, now I am
[1140.20] not with you again but want to marry you, have I gone mad, yes, and
[1145.28] you have forced me to go mad by
[1148.68] talking so innocently,
[1152.24] now a man is a human being, if he doesn't change,
[1156.20] what else will he do, if this man is a human being, it would be better if he stays a little conscious,
[1165.12] I know how scared you are.  I am going through the most beautiful phase of my life The
[1170.20] feeling of being with you The
[1174.36] feeling of being with you is very satisfying for me
[1177.08] And I am going through the most difficult phase of my life
[1180.72] [Sangeet] Give
[1190.00] me all your sorrows
[1192.16] [Sangeet] Give me this
[1196.68] much right
[1201.52] Remove all the fear from your heart
[1206.20] Whatever happens tomorrow
[1208.92] I am always with you
[1211.60] Remember this
[1216.28] If you guys allow me, I can
[1219.12] come inside Because Sami and I are tired of doing guard duty outside Please please come
[1224.16] Thank
[1227.16] you
[1231.40] Now I have brought something for you too Check it out Yes Yes
[1245.24] Areeez How is it Wow it is very nice The colour will
[1249.32] look good It will suit me a lot
[1251.93] [Sangeet]
[1254.28] Hey
[1257.12] Atul
[1258.76] How are you
[1261.60] fine It
[1263.68] seems you guys are quite busy What a
[1269.28] beautiful
[1270.92] dress Did you guys not finish your shopping even after the wedding By
[1275.96] the way many many congratulations for Haram's wedding
[1283.16] You did not invite anyone to the wedding
[1286.44] But look we still got to know By
[1289.72] the way I wanted to come to your house To
[1296.84] meet your daughter-in-law My house
[1300.32] Yes Do you not know about Momna and Arham's wedding
[1309.32] But  Afan bhai was involved in it and
[1314.52] Faraz was a witness to the marriage. He
[1318.80] likes doing such good deeds
[1321.43] [Music]
[1325.04] Faiz aunty you might have misunderstood.
[1329.56] What are you saying, Hareez. Why would I have
[1332.36] misunderstood? You both are at fault, Faiza bhabhi.
[1336.60] Look, I wanted to
[1339.36] come to your house after burying all my grievances and talk to Arham and Momna about
[1342.52] Abir's relationship. And the thing is
[1345.44] that Abir and Faraz like each other very much,
[1348.32] and I also don't have any objection.
[1352.00] I am very happy in my daughter's happiness.
[1354.88] I believe that one should never impose one's choice on one's children,
[1358.92] otherwise the
[1362.48] consequences of such a secret marriage are as a result
[1366.48] [Music] By
[1378.56] the way, when are you people telling about your marriage,
[1384.64] it depends on Faan uncle. Maybe
[1388.68] he is waiting for a suitable time. The suitable
[1390.44] time is not waited for, a
[1392.40] ground is prepared for that.
[1394.28] Where is the talk of preparing the ground going on?
[1397.16] Talks of preparing the ground are going on in your house.
[1398.64] In my house. And I was asking
[1402.44] that you people  Why don't you tell Amtula aunty about your marriage?
[1409.20] I think as time passes
[1411.00] and she comes to know, she will be very upset
[1414.13] [Sangeet]
[1438.09] [Sangeet] Yes,
[1449.00] you called
[1451.28] me.
[1453.08] Yes, I called you. I
[1457.16] wanted to ask you whether
[1458.64] you have just got married or
[1462.60] things have gone beyond marriage. Amma,
[1466.32] what kind of questions are you asking me? The question is
[1468.16] very simple. If you are giving me an answer, then
[1471.48] give it, otherwise I will call your beloved wife and
[1474.56] get the answer.
[1476.16] See, so much sarcasm in your tone, so lame, does
[1479.44] n't look good. Mama, whatever you want to ask,
[1481.96] ask me clearly. Come, I will tell
[1487.52] you myself. Yes, I have married Momna
[1492.60] and there is no crime in this.
[1495.48] I did not want to marry Fiza.
[1498.36] I had told you earlier also. I will say the same thing even now
[1503.24] [Sangeet]
[1506.20] So this is your final
[1509.40] decision. You know, I always fulfill my commitment.
[1514.20] Okay,
[1517.88] you fulfill your commitment.
[1521.04] I have also made a promise to myself.
[1526.12] And I fulfill that promise. And you
[1529.96] fulfill your promise. You
[1532.68] can go
[1534.87] [Sangeet]
[1556.68] ho
[1559.73] [sangeet]
[1568.29] [praise]
[1572.08] I could not even imagine that Mama would react like this
[1576.44] I found her behaviour very strange I mean I
[1581.08] thought that maybe she would shout at us and throw
[1585.44] us both out of this house but
[1588.12] she did not do anything like that this is probably the
[1590.28] silence before the storm she could have thrown
[1594.04] me and Abir out of the house by pushing us
[1599.08] but she did not
[1604.24] say anything her
[1606.52] silence might be causing more pain to her I
[1612.08] work
[1614.68] I will tell Papa to talk to Mama
[1617.24] she can handle her
[1622.61] [sangeet]
[1644.08] while doing Arham's Nikaah you
[1648.32] neither thought about my wishes nor
[1650.40] my happiness
[1653.24] you did not even bother to ask me
[1656.28] and not only this you made that girl the bride of my son and brought her to
[1660.92] my house and I did
[1663.80] not even get to know people from outside are coming and
[1667.04] congratulating me they are taunting me without any reason
[1672.76] wow wow Phan sahab wow what a friendship
[1677.28] you have maintained with your Abrar
[1679.30] [sangeet] if
[1680.64] your
[1683.40] Arham would have done this to me I would have understood
[1687.36] but you
[1689.80] lied to me  I
[1695.32] kept you in the dark If your conversation is over then let me
[1699.08] say something The conversation you have started now will not
[1703.00] end so easily Afan sahab,
[1706.76] you and Arham together have played a big game with me
[1712.44] I had only heard about Jaadu Tony
[1715.52] I feel that before dying
[1718.68] Abrar made both of you drink such a talisman
[1721.48] that
[1725.12] even after all this his daughter's ghost has
[1727.80] not left your heads I wish I too could get such a talisman
[1730.36] that I can make you drink by fooling you
[1733.04] so that your thinking changes When will my thinking
[1737.64] not change ok then don't change but remember
[1741.28] your stubbornness will take your son
[1743.16] very far from you hey I have
[1746.00] returned your son to you

[2011.33] [sangeet]
[2045.68] yes brother its good you called me to so many agencies I was about to
[2049.96] go for a meeting
[2052.92] Afan sahab this work is
[2057.28] more important than your meeting and I want this
[2059.44] work to be finished today itself
[2060.68] [sangeet]
[2063.40] yes, tell me what's the work
[2070.09] [sangeet]
[2071.56] ah Afan
[2072.96] sahab so this matter is between me and you and the
[2077.48] principles should be between me and you only
[2081.28] but you and your
[2084.16] son have been breaking the principles and laws of this house for the
[2087.92] last few months
[2091.84] so it doesn't matter to me
[2095.36] what is good and what is bad going to happen in this house
[2099.08] I assure you that from today
[2102.96] whatever will happen in this house will be seen only as per your
[2105.16] wish
[2106.80] forget what has passed
[2111.92] if this union was not in the fate of these two then
[2115.84] their marriage would never have happened Afan
[2120.68] sahab the fate of these two is written by you only to
[2124.64] defeat me, to hurt my pride
[2128.56] or maybe to
[2131.64] take revenge for the decision taken in the past all the
[2134.60] decisions taken in this house before today were
[2137.84] all for your happiness if I had ever
[2142.08] stopped you till today you would have stopped me you didn't stop me at that time you are a
[2145.08] man
[2147.60] otherwise you have attacked me very intelligently in
[2151.84] front of my son  I did not
[2154.88] leave anything worth saying, what nonsense are
[2158.16] you saying, Mama, please listen to me, if you want to get
[2160.52] angry, scold me, you can
[2162.16] scold me, but don't say these things, no, I have
[2165.52] lost the right to say anything, a
[2167.92] son always belongs to his father and you have already
[2172.08] proved it, Mama, there is no such
[2174.84] thing, please try to understand,
[2176.60] I could not tell you in that situation,
[2178.92] and you told dad, in this way, the
[2182.36] relationship between you two has become strong, but
[2185.56] my relationship with your dad has ended
[2190.94] [Music]
[2193.64] Aunty, these are the khula papers, if you want, you can
[2197.96] end this matter at home itself, and
[2200.16] if you don't do that, then I will have to
[2202.72] go to court to get khula from you
[2206.71] [Music],
[2208.16] she can go to any extent to give life to her stubbornness,
[2211.04] but I will
[2217.56] not be happy with both of you under any circumstances,
[2219.28] this is my promise to you, then only
[2222.72] one person can be happy in this house,
[2225.28] either
[2228.12] this or that
[2237.72] [Music]
