[96.84] [Music]
[103.96] Sajna hey
[106.56] ass hey son  Whose son is Yami, he
[111.96] is yours
[114.61] [Sangeet]
[117.08] No what happened, why are you crying,
[120.56] everything
[123.96] is fine as usual, Aamtala aunty must have insulted me,
[126.80] Aapi this is not a new thing for us, isn't it
[130.48] Shami, brother, you explain to your
[134.36] Aapi, she will not listen to me,
[138.24] what happened, Aapi
[142.00] tell me, Aapi tell me what happened, he must have got angry, and
[146.72] what not, he got angry, and
[152.08] then again, he has asked for a bribe from uncle,
[156.20] his home is breaking down because of me, you
[161.04] too, this must be his way of venting out his anger,
[162.84] and isn't it anger, it is hatred, the
[168.92] hatred that I have seen in his eyes for me,
[172.80] if after that I
[175.48] stay in this house for even a moment, it would be injustice to you people,
[177.80] what are you saying, she
[180.80] hates me a lot, a
[182.96] lot of
[184.92] hatred, I don't know why she
[187.72] hates me so much,
[189.76] but this hatred can never turn into love
[193.58] [Sangeet]
[195.24] and all this is why Aa Bha loves you
[199.08] and I cannot see anyone else sharing Arham's love
[211.26] [Sangeet]
[214.24] ok, this is a good thing
[216.80] afan  Brother's life will be spared,
[220.32] otherwise he spent his whole life
[223.36] in front of this woman by lowering his tone and lowering his eyes.
[229.36] This is also not a life, it is a wife, it is a woman. It is
[235.24] strange that Mama, so much hatred for Lanti and
[239.92] so much sympathy for Afan uncle, it is compulsion.
[245.20] Sympathy for Afan bhai and lifelong
[251.04] enmity between us, well, leave it, now there is no time for all these
[254.88] things. I think I should talk to Afan bhai right now. Anyway, it has been a
[260.76] long time since I talked to him.
[263.68] Okay Mama, as you wish, but
[267.60] please take care that the present time is
[269.80] not mentioned because I know he will
[272.36] not like it. Don't worry,
[273.80] I will take care
[278.20] and if there is any good news, then
[285.92] definitely tell me. I am sorry
[289.04] Papa, what problem has Mama put you in,
[291.36] why is she doing all this? If
[294.68] I tell you the truth, I have
[297.28] not understood my mother till date. On one hand, she says
[300.20] that she cares for me the most
[301.56] in this world and on the other hand, she does
[306.04] not see my sorrow, my problem, my happiness.
[308.80] Why is she helpless son? Maybe, by her nature,
[315.72] in her eyes, she does not see you.  for me this is their love
[319.63] [music]
[330.87] [music]

[387.00] matter to me so even if you do

[662.24] my name.

[1024.92] ruined the peace of my house in four days,
[1029.52] who taught you all this, you have
[1032.60] turned me against my son, you have
[1036.88] forced me to take divorce from my husband,
[1040.44] how do you do all this
[1043.52] with such an innocent face, aunty, why are you
[1045.96] talking like this, Allah forbid that the
[1048.48] peace of your house is ruined by staying in this house, then
[1051.20] this prayer of yours cannot be accepted
[1053.56] because either you will stay in this house or
[1056.08] I will and I have decided this, now
[1059.52] you have to decide who will go first,
[1061.96] I had told you that
[1065.12] you have no place in my house and in my son's life,
[1066.76] but you did
[1069.28] not listen to me, you created a drama of your oppressed soul in front of Afa,
[1074.20] wow, what an upbringing you have done  Your
[1077.48] parents are
[1079.24] not ashamed of you I have
[1082.28] seen the most shameless people in my life but I have
[1085.40] not seen anyone more shameless than you Aunty why are you
[1088.80] talking like this I have only
[1091.08] asked about uncle's health so now you will
[1094.36] tell me when and what should I talk about
[1097.56] Aunty
[1100.12] please can't you forgive me there is
[1103.16] one reason to forgive you
[1106.24] tell me he turned my son against me should I
[1109.28] forgive
[1111.44] you for this my husband was forced to divorce me should I
[1114.08] forgive you for this you
[1116.64] know you don't you in fact you know very well
[1120.08] that everything is happening because of you
[1122.04] if you were not in the hospital right now then
[1126.12] I would have kicked you out of my house
[1129.92] because this is what you
[1132.40] deserve
[1141.83] [Music]
[1153.04] and today we will talk to
[1156.24] you what happened why are you crying did you get a
[1158.96] call from the hospital but I
[1162.28] just spoke to Faraz aunty he is with him
[1164.32] uncle is absolutely fine
[1166.04] what happened api why are you not telling
[1168.80] why are you crying what should I
[1171.56] say you pack your stuff pick up Sami we are leaving
[1175.36] from here  Sami has just finished his milk and slept.
[1178.08] Why are you packing? Are we going somewhere?
[1181.52] Yes, we shouldn't have come here.
[1183.93] [Music]
[1186.04] But Allah
[1188.64] can give us a chance to correct our mistakes at any time. Pack your stuff.
[1193.52] Okay, I will pack my stuff. But
[1197.84] now if anyone should go, it's
[1201.32] me and Sami. And why would you
[1203.84] leave this house? This is your house. No matter
[1206.32] how difficult the situation is, I am
[1208.08] not afraid of difficult situations. I am afraid too.
[1219.56] I cannot tolerate anyone pointing a finger at the upbringing of my mother and father due to my helplessness and bad luck.
[1221.88] What has happened? Is everything alright? Is something
[1224.52] alright? Nothing has gone alright.
[1228.32] Aunty asked for a divorce. And if uncle
[1229.68] gives divorce in anger, then oh, so
[1231.36] Atul, aunty is making a drama of her own life.
[1234.64] Why do you need to leave your house? It was my home
[1237.96] when it was, but this house should not be ruined. There
[1247.68] should not be a rift in the relationship between uncle and aunty. People will see the drama of this house
[1250.76] and Arham's head will bow down, you
[1254.64] know?  What will make Arham Bhai's head bow down
[1257.28] when you leave this house? Do
[1259.24] you remember, you had promised him
[1262.12] that you will stand by him no matter what the circumstances are, it doesn't
[1265.40] matter if my promise is broken, then
[1269.76] this house should not break. And
[1273.72] your house, Aapi, was just a dream, let it
[1278.60] break,
[1282.60] what difference will it make?
[1284.45] [Music] I
[1288.92] agree, Aapi
[1290.27] [Music]
[1298.74] [Music] Here, just take
[1307.60] this,
[1315.80] take the keys, how much money have you earned, brother?
[1327.34] [Music]
[1329.20] Aapi, is this door open, how can it be, I have the
[1333.72] keys, look properly, I am
[1336.48] saying, look, the gate ahead is open,
[1338.44] ok, wait a minute,
[1342.40] brother, you look properly,
[1351.08] how can this be possible, that is what I am saying, I have done a
[1354.24] great job, aunty, you enjoyed it a lot, I saw
[1357.92] how you got both of them out of the house,
[1360.20] I still cannot believe,
[1362.68] aunty, how do you do it, you
[1365.76] enjoyed it a lot, I can't believe any situation or
[1369.20] person, who gives it to you, and you will handle it,
[1372.36] but aunty, you have taken care of this, right, that Aapi might not
[1378.48] leave this house, what
[1381.84] nonsense are you talking about, I am not saying anything  I am not talking uselessly
[1385.36] Aunty I cannot live in a dream world like you,
[1389.60] you also shouldn't live there,
[1393.32] you are probably forgetting this,
[1397.08] what is the illusion, it is not just your son
[1400.92] but also Momna's husband,
[1404.64] Aapi yes, I
[1409.28] feel something is wrong, what
[1411.68] could be wrong, Bir, I had the keys, so you
[1414.44] only know why it will take you to break the lock,
[1417.00] yes, yes, it is my husband's house, I have a
[1422.12] place to stay,
[1425.28] yes, no, I cannot survive in 10-20 Hajj,
[1432.84] ok, I will tell you, we will talk later,
[1436.36] why have you come here,
[1439.48] where else should I have gone, it is my husband's
[1443.00] house, I will come here only, what are you doing
[1445.16] here, you got married,
[1448.32] right, the story ends in four days,
[1452.44] this is not your husband's house and
[1455.60] after he left, we have no connection with you, I
[1457.16] understand, this is our mother's house, come on,
[1461.56] pack your things and get out of here right now, oh
[1463.68] Allah, look at the amazing tongue she is talking, I got jealous, didn't I
[1466.20] lose my temper, I
[1469.84] thought that she had stumbled so much, she must have come to her senses,
[1472.16] our enemies stumbled  And very
[1475.20] soon Insha Allah you will see me rotting in jail. The
[1477.84] police did not find any proof against me,
[1479.84] that is why they let me go. And look
[1484.56] Kasadan, this seems to be some of your doings.
[1487.52] Tell me the truth, you have beaten your father, didn't you?
[1490.60] You had big issues with your father, you used to keep saying chu chu chu to your father all the time.
[1492.96] Stop talking
[1496.68] nonsense, stop talking nonsense.
[1498.92] You don't need to talk to me. I do
[1500.72] n't even have any interest in talking to people like you. And
[1502.64] you had your eyes on my Baba's house from the first day.
[1504.44] Yes, so why wouldn't you, it is my
[1506.44] husband's house, he brought me to this
[1508.40] house as his wife. For God's sake, will you both keep quiet? Whatever
[1511.08] mistake our father made is done,
[1514.12] but you haven't learned anything from your mistake,
[1516.24] which relations are you talking about?
[1519.84] Whatever you did to me, at that time
[1523.20] you did not remember these relations. Listen
[1525.12] wife, I told you that there was a need for me to open my mouth, I told you to
[1531.16] stay in Kasadan with respect, but no, you
[1534.44] wanted a rich and knowledgeable boy, you got married, your
[1537.32] wish was fulfilled, thank God that you did
[1540.80] not marry him.  I could never
[1544.12] forgive myself, come on, now please
[1547.48] forgive me, you did it on your own will,
[1551.12] although this relationship had been refused in your father's life,
[1555.32] at least you
[1558.16] could have saved his honor, why are you engaged in such a useless argument,
[1560.96] friend, I will call Faraz and now I
[1563.80] feel that we will have to take the help of the police,
[1567.24] oh
[1570.08] please there is no need to do anything like this, you
[1574.00] go inside, I will talk to him myself,
[1576.80] what will Faraz think that a
[1579.44] new drama happens in our house every day,
[1581.92] go inside,
[1590.60] brother, I have brought the food items and am going to cook, if
[1593.68] you people want to eat, then
[1596.64] tell me, Rana
[1600.76] Maj Salam Walekum Sahib Walekum Salam, everyone, that
[1604.96] Mamna Bibi, and now Bibi has left the house
[1607.24] and has also taken all her belongings, she has
[1610.60] left the house, I don't know where she has gone, when
[1613.68] I asked, Abir Bibi started saying that this is all that is
[1616.08] written in our name in this house, we are
[1618.64] going to our house
[1625.27] [Sangeet]
[1633.56] Aapi, you know very well that this woman is a
[1636.96] number one fraud, still you have
[1639.16] agreed to keep her at home.  We do
[1640.96] n't take decisions emotionally
[1643.40] till you get married,
[1646.72] we will have to live with them in the same house, if they don't agree then we will call them
[1651.32] our daughters, it's okay, we
[1653.92] can consider them our elders,
[1657.32] how can I accept that I am elder, sister,
[1660.96] your heart is very big,

[1692.71] [Music]
[1701.76] Sajna
[1703.60] Parham, I want to apologize to you and uncle, I ca
[1708.24] n't break anyone's home,
[1711.12] I will build a palace of my happiness on Atul aunty's broken house,
[1718.12] this cannot be done by me,
[1721.60] aunty hates me
[1725.04] and her hatred will never end,
[1729.16] if this relationship can end then
[1732.24] this is in our control and I
[1736.92] swear to you,
[1738.56] you will do only what your mumma wants
[1741.84] [Music]
[1744.80] Saj, you went away, I was helpless, how can I express this
[1750.96] pain, Raja Raja, all the dreams became chhamcham,
[1756.04] rains, thirsty
[1759.68] eyes lost, Sajna Bahara, heart Sajna Bahara,
[1766.76] heart Sajna
[1768.56] ho, Sajna Haara dil Sajna Bahara, heart Sajna sajave, haara dil sajave
[1794.52] How are you decorated
[1797.64] [Sangeet]
[1807.20] [Sangeet]
[1826.24] A
[1831.71] [Sangeet] be
[1855.28] careful, come comfortably,
[1859.88] how are you, I am fine
[1877.67] [Sangeet]
[1890.26] [Sangeet]
[1896.28] R K
[1899.48] P but you will drink later, right yes, the girl is fine,
[1910.96] where is Mamna? Has someone stopped her from
[1914.32] coming to
[1917.92] meet me?
[1919.12] Maybe she doesn't care about you, that's why she didn't
[1921.80] come, I am sure she is most
[1924.48] worried about you, it's my misconception, I asked her to
[1928.24] come with me, she clearly refused, no
[1930.48] problem, anyway, I did
[1934.44] not feel bad about her saying this and perhaps she has started to understand the
[1937.76] delicacy of the time and your mother's health very
[1940.44] well,
[1943.60] our house
[1946.08] needed such an understanding daughter-in-law
[1950.85] [Sangeet],
[1957.68] how sad will Papa be when he comes to know
[1960.56] that Momna is not at home
[1963.16] [Sangeet]
[1967.60] what's the matter
[1969.62] [Sangeet]
[1971.48] son, I have become much better,
[1976.04] then why are you so worried and confused?
[1979.52] No, nothing, I am
[1982.32] missing you a lot at home and in the office,
[1984.92] just
[1988.80] maybe, okay Papa, Feroz uncle wanted to meet you,
[1992.48] some consignment, let me
[1995.24] sign,
[1996.24] I will call you, tell me
[2004.44] how are you  If you are yes then it is fine,
[2008.88] now why have you come to take money, you
[2012.36] could not do my work with me, then how, have you
[2014.52] lost your mind about money, look
[2018.00] you will have to work with me only,
[2019.40] your daughter-in-law who is with me, now it has become
[2023.24] a little difficult to survive with this little money, your daughter-in-law, her
[2025.52] child,
[2028.76] what should I do, she is not my daughter-in-law, I
[2032.08] hate her, her child,
[2034.16] her entire family,
[2035.96] hey what difference will your hatred make,
[2039.04] tell me, I am getting a divorce very soon,
[2041.56] then you know and your child, rather
[2045.52] taking that child in your lap will be useful to
[2047.40] you, now in this old age you are not going to get
[2050.96] married again, what all will you
[2053.88] spend your whole life begging like this, just do it, I am
[2056.36] not a fool anyway
[2059.40] I do not have the habit of talking nonsense, I
[2061.12] just say what is in my heart,
[2065.28] and the
[2067.64] truth is that I did exactly as you said, did you
[2072.92] tell me or not, and to tell you the truth, the
[2075.80] love between both of you is very strong, you tried a million times,
[2078.32] what happened, you could not separate both of you, nothing
[2082.16] happened, you tried your best, but
[2085.04] see you yourself said  I had a misunderstanding, get Kasadan
[2089.04] married, I agreed to your request and
[2091.52] supported you, I even rejected the promise of my late husband, for
[2094.12] your
[2095.88] sake,
[2097.48] what was the need for me to force you,
[2099.80] but I listened to you and did what you said, it's
[2102.44] enough, what do you
[2107.44] mean by this nonsense,
[2110.40] what do you want after all? It's a simple
[2113.56] matter, the money you gave me to get me married was
[2116.44] all spent in the courts,
[2118.68] now I can't survive on the pension,
[2121.48] what should I do, wife? By the way, I
[2124.92] promise you that as soon as I
[2127.32] get a job, I will never even step on your door, I
[2129.40] promise you, you are
[2132.04] standing at my door, why? Have I
[2134.60] taken the contract to bear your expenses? No, no,
[2137.52] but I can do something for the sake of humanity,
[2140.24] look, the relationship between you and me is very
[2143.68] delicate, there is no relationship between you
[2146.28] and me, you understood, I am
[2149.28] giving you money, but don't show your face to me in future,
[2154.60] I have only suffered losses by trusting you, neither you were of any use to me,
[2157.00] nor your
[2158.44] nephew, it is my mistake, whatever I shared
[2161.80] with you  You shared it right,
[2165.16] where are you and where am
[2176.72] I
