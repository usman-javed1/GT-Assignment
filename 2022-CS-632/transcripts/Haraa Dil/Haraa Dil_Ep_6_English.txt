I have lost my heart Sajna I have lost my heart Sajna Sajna ji I am here Jeba sister please come come the door was open I came inside how are you I thought maybe like my daughters you also think that I am guilty of Shagufta you have become angry maybe I think so well why would I think like this your daughters have crossed all limits I have never seen you so harsh and too harsh in your nature and I have also never seen you with bad mind so in Abra these two went on whom it is all your fault you know daughters are someone else's trust you should not have given them so much importance you are saying absolutely right the fault is really mine because of me their happiness has got such evil eye I have tried a lot but I am not able to break it you will feel bad about what I am saying but believe me my heart is very sad seeing the condition of your house in the midst of centuries how could I see any dust or mark on anything in this house and this unlucky one who would have got the lap of his mother would have played today brothers and sisters are like mothers what kind of sisters are these that this innocent  He is not even allowed to touch her, how long will this go on, if I ask them [music] right Momna, how are you right now, son, how are you, and where is Momna, she has gone to the university, her exams are about to start, okay, she is busy with her exams, but you are at home these days, what a mess have you made of this house, it seems like someone has not come to this house for a long time, how can Shagufta's daughters be so irresponsible and senseless and I am also surprised at Torar Bhai that he has left all his work and is sitting at home and that innocent child, that innocent child, I feel as if he is growing up in an orphanage, you both are sisters, his sisters are in the place of a mother, if not that innocent child, take care of your father, I have not seen or heard much like this, first of all, you do not need to interfere in the matters of our house and secondly, if you have so much sympathy for that innocent child, then pick him up and take him to your house, there is no need to come here and lecture me, we are senseless, okay, very nonsense  Have you been able to take advantage of my love You two sisters have taken advantage of my softness If I am silent, it does not mean that I am dead along with your mother I can take care of myself and my child as long as I am alive, do you understand I do not need anyone's help I do not know why people pray for daughters I feel ashamed to call both of you my daughters who do not have anything called humanity [Music] You have found happiness by setting our house on fire Now go and celebrate in your house [Music] [Music] Momina Moman What rang with you How long will you keep running away from me If you think that it is my mistake, then at least give me a chance to correct my mistake friend And I am saying this for you too Otherwise I know that I did not have any wrong intention Yes, my reaction was wrong I have apologized for that to you as well as to Abir as well as to uncle What else do you want Muna I want to make everything the same as before Now nothing is the same as before neither me nor our life nor our house  When I go home, the house runs to bite me. Panic comes from Ammi's room and the child keeps crying all the time and I also feel like going to see her face, going near her, her voice reminds me of Ammi. It feels as if she is somewhere writhing in pain. Strong Mamna, life is very short. What is there today, is life. The rest is all forgiven. You are saying the right thing. I don't know what humans don't think. Allah does something that does not even happen in our imagination. I should walk. I don't want to walk on that path again, where my Ammi's memories are only in my mind. She lost her life because of some marriage. Don't talk to me. Life and death are not in the hands of humans. These are all decisions of nature. Still, I should walk. If aunty comes to know about it, she will be angry. She will say that even after so much insult, I don't leave you. The truth is Momna, neither do you leave me, nor do your memories stop calling you.  No matter how much I try, my heart ruins my efforts. Swarna Momna, I want to do everything first, I want to make everything right. For me, you are the most important. Everything else comes later. And for me, my self-respect is of utmost importance. How can I give that respect to your mama? The respect of that relationship which is like that of a mother, a relationship which is of great respect. [ Music] I'm sorry, I will talk to mama [Music] [Music] Let's go from this house, Aapi, why are we living here when we don't have even a penny's respect in this house. Today, Baba has given me a lot of respect. She comes in front of my wife and tells me, what is her problem? Why does she interfere? What has happened in our life? Where will we go now? We will not go anywhere from this house. We will not stay here. He is just his son's father. Our sorrow, our pain is nothing for him. Today, he has ended all relationships. What has happened to Baba? Why is he taking out his child's anger on us? I should go and talk to Baba right now. There is no use in talking to Baba. They only listen to their heart and in their hearts, they have their son. Our relation with them ended when our mother died. I cannot live in this house, Aapi, I cannot live with the memories of my mother and when this father also lost his mind, what are you saying, where will we go, we have neither a home nor a place, we will go and camp on the road, listen to me, we have nothing else except this house, right now please don't get so emotional, by doing this you are causing pain to yourself and me too. I am not getting emotional, Aapi, I am telling the truth, I will go anywhere, to my college hostel, Memon hostel or anywhere, I feel suffocated here, I cannot live here, I cannot see this form of Baba, if you are coming then it's fine, otherwise I am leaving, I have lost my mind, give me a seat here, shut up and sit, enough is enough [Music] Look, listen to me [Music] this is our house, our Ammi's house, we will not go anywhere from here, it is your mistake, these things went away with Ammi and this This house belonged to Baba and now belongs to his son Daughters do not have a home Amma used to say, today I understand that if a mother dies the doors of the palaces are closed the daughters' home is finished oh this is not our house oh just now just our house [Music] [Music] [Music] hey friend Sami hey friend what happened to you today this is the seventh and last diaper which I have changed and it is not diapered now ok friend hey wait friend Sami wait friend ok I am calling sister Jeba [Music] oh my god I am going to be number one oh friend why are you embarrassing father and those sisters of yours oh seeing me in this condition Nana gets very happy she was not like this come to me come come ok ok ok hello yes sister Jeba I am very sorry I will have to take some trouble you are crying a lot I don't know his health is not well you please come I am not able to understand what to do I am very grateful to you Thank you arrere arre oe [Music] Ai take care of yourself from tomorrow well done start going to college [Music] If we cry like this ammi will be so sad [Music] No she has just disappeared she must be feeling everything well done Aapi listen to me once [Music] will you listen to me do n't delay your marriage too much [Music] Ammi will also be the happiest when you get married [Music] Aram bhai must be coming to the university right [Music] do n't ignore him so much that he goes away from you [Music] I don't want to think about the relationship I have with Aram it is better for me if he goes away I am sure all my life I do n't want to board that boat from which there is no way to return and no signal to go ahead the most unsure one is here you are the one in this house it's been two months since ammi went away baba did not sit with us even once he did not talk to us we also did not sit with him we are also blaming him for everything ah then he must have also got influenced by me mummy and baba's happiness and sorrows were together loneliness so  He must be feeling the same too, so this is what I am telling you, in Atul aunty's house, Arham bhai will be with you, he will be your companion in happiness, you don't need anyone else. Arham bhai is very nice, his heart is bigger than even Baba's, he was with us in everything, cried with us, scolded us, got angry, he supported us a lot, please judge, right decisions are not made, let my exams be over, I will get a job at a good place and everything will be fine, nothing will be fine, you see, I have decided how to make everything right, if life has put me to test, then I will not accept defeat, Mummy's head will bow down, people will talk about her and I will not like it [Music] I will not let Mummy's head hide, if you want Mummy's happiness, then get married, after this I will not make any demand [Music] Truth be told, he keeps crying all the time, where are you going, I am going to close the door, I cannot tolerate it [Music] voice, what should I do, Sami, don't cry, don't cry, wait, wait, come, ok, come, come, come  Come here, oh son, yes, yes, just don't cry, why did you call me in such an emergency? I am scared, is everything alright? He does n't know what happened. He is crying a lot. Just look at him. He was absolutely fine till evening. Tell me, he has drunk milk. Let me see if he is having motions. I am not able to understand anything. Sister, he drinks milk and vomits it. Now what medicine should I give to such a small child? To me, you also look sick. Abrar Bhai, bring me his feeder. There are ways to feed a child. If Shagufta was here, she would have told you. Please give me a good pair of shoes for him. I will get them changed. Then after that, we will go to the doctor. He gets a little sick because of dirt. If the doctor comes to know about this, he will be very angry. Do you have any baby oil or powder? You are using it like this. Whatever you have is in front of you. Sister, please look at it. I myself am not able to understand what to do. The child is so small, small. He is wearing these clothes. [ Music] Take it [Music] Abrar Bhai, you are deaf.  If you don't agree then one thing is coming to my tongue this child and this house needs an sensible woman running a house and raising children is not a man's cup of tea some work suits a woman so you are doing well I have spoken to a couple of people Insha Allah I hope that arrangement for a maid will be made it has been so many days I have not gone to the office my whole system has become confused a maid is a maid after all and how can she give the status of a mother these issues of yours will keep on going Apara [Sangeet] I do n't understand what to do is there any good woman in your view who can look after the house and take care of this as well see maybe you will not mind my advice but Apara Bhai your daughters are not worthy of anything if they were there then I would not have said this but it is true that this child needs a mother hospital doctor this is a matter of later he will rule my mother you should get married [Sangeet] [Sangeet] what happened just now why did you go away I was thinking once that without you we will die what happened sister what happened tell me Baba has said something, Seba aunty has come, she must have given some fatwa, so I will go and see, right now no, she said nothing [Sangeet] I ca n't wait to go towards the room, I can't wait either, and have you seen Baba, what a state he has created in that room [Sangeet] Come on aunty, it's okay, it will be fine, Inshallah relax [Sangeet] Allah has always put Abrar in some or the other test, so I am very worried about him, friend, I can't understand what will happen to him, were the problems of the first two daughters not enough, at this age the responsibility of a son has also fallen on his head, you are absolutely right, after Shagufta aunty's death, Momina has travelled the most in that house, I didn't help her at all, what is the use of such a relationship, Papa, please tell Mama that you should not delay the marriage at all, have we taken the contract of the needs of the whole family, I thought that after all this, you will refuse this marriage and would have insulted you again and again And you repeatedly suppress your self-respect and reach there uncle, I do n't want to argue with you, but this relationship is not like a glass that breaks with a little hurt. You do n't care about our respect, you only care about your relationship. The respect that you care so much about, you sometimes give the same respect to others as well. [ Praise] [ Music] [Praise] [ Music] [Music] [ Music] [Music] [Music] Hello, Salam Walekum, brother, how are you? Yes, I am fine, Aapi, how are you? Aapi is not well. She is resting. What happened? Show her to a doctor. She doesn't even talk to me. How will the depression reduce? I will come with you. Let's take her to a doctor. No, no, there is no need for you to come. I have given her a tablet. She will be fine if she rests for a while. Yaar, you people have completely minused me from your life. I am tired of fighting alone. At least you support me now. Please switch off the light. I am feeling sleepy. I want to sleep. [Sangeet] hmm [Sangeet] Whatever is happening is happening only because of you. You favour him in every wrong thing. Day by day he is going out of my control. Explain to him. I am his mother. I can be lenient to a certain extent. This is all your doing. Atul, you keep hurting him all the time. He is not a child, he has grown up. Now do n't say such things that make him angry. And the chapter of Shagufta is now closed. Atul, forgive him for God's sake. What do you want to say? What do you mean by saying that I am a cruel woman. I am the enemy of my son's happiness. Is this what I have not been able to understand till date. At what time are you whose enemy and at what time whose friend? Why is your hatred so intense with Abrar and his family? By the way Atul, look, if you want, everyone can be happy in this house, but you will have to clear your heart for him. What do you want to say? What do you mean by this? Whenever I remember the attitude of that mad girl, Bir,  So my blood starts boiling, look Atul, I am not going to marry Abhir, I am going to marry Momina, Afan sahab, sisters have a great impact on sisters, you should understand this, nothing has gone wrong yet, there is still time and you should make me understand that I should stop dreaming of building a relationship with those people, my friend, I have not been able to make you understand till date, so how can I make anyone else understand, you should consider someone an enemy for once, okay, then that state of mind will be in your control, your heart wants to put your thumb on his throat and choke him, just do it my friend, for God's sake, what has happened, forgive everyone, for Allah's sake [Music] sister, keep him for 10 more minutes, this medicine is not from the pharmacy, I will have to get it from a pharmacy outside, okay, brother, you bring this medicine from the pharmacy, when you come, I will leave, you know that I cannot stay late at night, Nala is alone at home, I will come in 10 minutes [Music] Ouch, sorry, sorry, I am sorry, you cannot walk carefully, you should have walked carefully, you applied so much force that you did not understand here  Yes, isn't it Zeba? Oh Allah, how are you? I am absolutely fine. I am seeing you after so many years. And look, I recognised you as soon as I saw you. You have n't changed at all. Believe me, I am so happy to see you. I am also very happy. By the way, is there something in me that can change? Tell me, how are you? And how are you here? Ay, who? Have you become the mother of grandchildren? For God's sake, don't get upset yet. Tell me the truth. No, I don't have any grandchildren. I am not that old yet that I can become the mother of grandchildren. Do n't go into that either. This is our neighbour Abrar Bhai, his son. The same Abrar Bhai who just bumped into you. Oh Allah, loudly. Yes, he is the one. So who is he? He must be your Samadhi Mamad. Tell me the truth. Where is the mother of this child? Why are you carrying him in your lap? Oh, I am not related to his mother. Neither are I related to her. She died during delivery. And being a neighbour, I don't have to do that. Believe me, family, I am very fed up of this untimely labour. Oh, I can understand that they have only one child.  Has Allah blessed him with more children? He has two young daughters. May Allah give good guidance to the children of today. They do not take care of him at all. They do not even look at him. They say that because of him our mother died. Oh, Oh. Poor Apara also remains very worried. What's the good thing? By the way, he has got motions. He has a fever. He is very unwell. Come on, let me see. [Music] Come, where have these people gone? Will it not get worse then? Oh Allah. [Music] [Music] Seba, first of all the child is weak from birth. On top of that he is also premature. Look, it is very difficult to raise a weak child and a child without a mother. I think that instead of bringing him to the hospital, you should take him to a good child specialist. Is there anything serious? What were you saying? He will get well soon, right? Oh, Apar brother, why are you getting so worried. This is not your first child and he will get well. Don't worry at all. It's good that you people brought him on time. Otherwise, due to lack of water, the child could have died. This is the fault of sister Seba.  It's a kindness, I was not in my senses at all, now I have to be conscious. Sir, your child is premature and he needs intensive care. Though I have night duty here, but at 4 in the afternoon, I work with a very good child specialist, she is also a mother herself and Allah has blessed her with healing as well. You should bring this child there, he will be examined in detail there. I will give this advice, she is right, now he may need a doctor at any time, do this, brother, take that doctor's phone number and address, I will go and show him in the morning, I will tell you how to use the medicine and there is a drop in it, they also give it right now, I don't want to give him more medicines right now because tomorrow he will get it from the doctor, tell me the truth, I am giving you his address and my phone number, okay, call me before coming, the line is very long there, so I will take your number in advance, thank you very much, great kindness [Music] Baba has not come home since last night, his phone is also there  It is coming close, please ask Nala I am not asking anything, you should have told Baba where you are going and when you will return but no, he is only worried about his son [music] That poor guy is unwell since last night, I do n't know what condition he would be in now, leave worrying about him, Baba is there to take care of him, you worry about yourself, listen to me, don't be too harsh with Arham Bhai, yesterday there was a crying voice on his phone, he respects you [music] how can I forget you that he is Atul Aunty 's son, sinner Atul Aunty is a self-absorbed patient and such people don't see anyone except themselves, if I were in your place, I would have taken pity on them and seen the spectacle of their irritation, you know what the issue is that I am not like you, you are my brave Hitler sister, when Allah was making you, did he make you with great leisure or is he making you a masterpiece, tell me, you are the one, in this world there is no decency and no one for decency  There is no demand, the more bad-tempered a person is, the more people stay intimidated by him in order to save their respect and do you remember how I drove your company away and after that I angered Arham and Amma and I forgot that, I don't remember such things, you have to spend your life with me, you should remember that it seems Baba has come and if Arham is a brother then Salam Walekum Walekum Salam Ji, someone told me that a maid is needed here for a small child [Music]
