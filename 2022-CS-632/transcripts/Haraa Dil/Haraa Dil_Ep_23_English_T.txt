[340.36] son, thank
[348.48] you Breaking news in the compound court,
[351.96] firing in the murder case, one prisoner
[355.24] seriously injured while the other prisoner managed to escape from the scene, there was a
[361.68] stampede in the court, the gathering was stopped It is
[364.56] said that the prisoner is
[368.80] accused of murdering his aunt's husband and is
[375.04] also accused of being involved in more than 100 incidents of robbery and theft, the accused
[377.56] belongs to Hyderabad
[385.08] [Music] Oh no no,
[401.24] all the prisoners
[404.08] look the same, where can he run, no, this must be
[408.40] someone else
[411.53] [Music]
[439.28] Hello yes
[442.76] son, oh this is very bad
[445.96] friend, okay, no matter  No, I will see.
[449.92] Why are you crying?
[453.75] [Music]
[455.24] Friend, let me talk
[459.04] to Momna. Yes, mother,
[464.16] son, there is nothing to worry about.
[467.52] Look, that person has escaped from jail. The
[471.52] police must be after him and he will be
[474.84] caught again, if not today, then tomorrow. Be
[476.68] patient, son,
[479.12] trials come from Allah and we should
[483.40] face these trials with great courage. Do
[486.88] n't worry, everything will be fine.
[491.20] What will happen now?
[493.33] [Music]
[494.64] You have heard it. If you want to know the details, then
[498.68] turn on any news channel and watch it.
[501.28] Afan sahab, I have to talk to you about something important.
[505.16] If you
[507.36] get free from the issues of outsiders, then worry about your family and your children
[509.84] too. I will
[511.08] talk to you on a phone call.
[521.36] Hello,
[523.52] now what is this childishness?
[528.80] Look, you will be late.
[536.48] You have scattered everything. Come, hurry up, otherwise it will be late. I don't want to
[539.48] become a bride. I don't want to become a
[541.44] bride. I want to go anywhere. I feel like if he comes in
[544.52] front of me
[546.28] and I kill him.
[547.88] How can the police let him escape?
[550.52] How can there be such irresponsibility?  Aapka apna hai aapka karte hain koi hai aapka ...
[667.44] If Sam is in the lap of his family even for a short while,
[672.40] I start feeling uneasy. The
[677.00] time is very short right now.
[681.08] I understand your concern about him, but there is
[684.04] no comparison between Arham Bhai and Aarat.
[687.32] You should see that one day he will go psycho because of both of them. He is a
[689.84] bad thing. He
[693.52] is my mother and your mother-in-law. May Allah have mercy
[700.20] on you. May you just see that day when he
[711.20] accepts you as his daughter-in-law. [Sangeet] And we had promised to stay here till your marriage.
[720.00] Today is the last day of that promise.
[727.21] [Sangeet] And I don't have any good hopes. [Sangeet] He
[730.24] loves you a lot and will
[734.16] never cheat you.
[735.88] Respect him. A mother's love
[740.04] always wins.
[742.96] I cannot deny this fact either.
[764.96] [Sangeet] Stop it,
[771.48] Afan. Stop it. Now that
[774.64] Israr has given his answer, he has made my children's
[777.92] lives hell. If
[780.28] you still don't realize this,
[781.96] then when will you realize it? Our
[783.04] children, our children Areej and
[787.60] Arham are our children. But maybe you have forgotten about
[791.28] other people's children.  If you get free from your issues, then
[794.40] think what all has happened to you.
[796.76] I know very well
[799.44] what all has happened to me.
[801.80] My son's house could not be settled.
[805.84] My daughter has been divorced
[809.88] because she is not happy with her husband
[813.24] or her husband is not happy with her. And do you know
[816.12] why everything is happening? All this is
[818.88] because of you. Whatever happens in this house,
[821.04] you are not responsible for it. Your
[823.48] friendship with Araj never strikes. The wind never strikes in velvet.
[827.92] You have seen the result.
[831.00] Your son is leaving the comfort of his home and
[834.32] wasting his time there. All this is a
[837.20] fuss of your mind and until this
[840.76] fuss ends, this house can never be settled.
[843.08] If Arham had married Fiza, then
[845.88] Areez would never have got divorced today.
[848.88] And if you had let Areez go with Jwar, then
[851.36] she too would never have got divorced.
[853.68] This is a lie, nonsense. She never
[857.08] loved Areez. You are extremely selfish.
[860.76] You have not allowed your daughter's house to be settled till date.
[865.40] She is yours.  I was happy with my husband but
[869.36] you did not like his happiness You always
[872.56] created distances in his path And if you could blame me for
[874.72] all the faults, you put them on my account All these
[877.64] faults are yours and will always be
[879.84] on your account Whatever I have
[882.00] done, I have done it for the peace of Aarish
[884.00] He was not some man from London
[886.28] who would bring all the happiness and give it to him
[888.40] Happiness comes with peace of mind
[892.08] If happiness came from a big house,
[896.48] you would not be asking for a divorce from me today We would be
[899.64] living a peaceful life in this house
[907.48] [Sangeet]
[930.88] [Sangeet] Hey,
[943.08] tell me when will I be happy
[946.12] When I will send you off as a bride with Aaram Bhai To
[950.88] that house where only you and Aaram
[954.80] Bhai
[955.84] live Have you gone mad, will I not
[963.72] become a bride again and again I know your tone is
[967.96] exactly like Aarim's
[969.02] [Sangeet] And I
[974.52] wish Aarim was here today She would have taught me a
[979.36] lesson She would have
[984.64] told me not to sit like this, don't talk like that Don't
[989.84] eat like that
[992.71] [Sangeet] Do
[1001.28] n't blame me for that work This will
[1006.68] keep on being a lesson
[1009.68] Ma
[1012.27] [Music]
[1016.28] So mother, whatever you said,
[1019.76] for me and Sami, you are our mother.
[1028.20] You and Sami never let you feel that you are a newly-wed bride. It is
[1033.60] not like that.
[1035.84] What did I say to
[1038.40] you? A woman is a natural mother.
[1042.16] All other
[1045.08] beings make a place in us to be blessed in that one season. It is
[1051.40] our thinking.
[1054.76] Aah, the age of bringing up the newly-wed hearts,
[1062.20] keep me with you always. May Allah keep you happy like this always.
[1066.86] [Music]
[1077.40] What do you mean, how will I tell you? [
[1080.37] Music] I
[1081.64] will not be with me. [Music]

[1121.96] where are you. Which was that unlucky moment when I took
[1124.48] up the contract of bringing you up. May Allah grant that
[1126.72] you die and even your dead body is not found. Stop this
[1129.20] drama Khala and tell me where are you.
[1131.76] Where are you? Tell me, I will call the police right now and
[1134.84] send them. Tell me, if you do
[1137.44] n't, Khala, I will tell you.  I will take your life, go away, I am
[1140.68] afraid of you killing me, it is better if you
[1143.04] kill me, then I will be spared from a Manu like you,
[1145.64] listen to me, aunt,
[1148.24] tell me where are you, otherwise I will come to your house, I do

[1164.52] little time, explain to your daughters that they should take
[1167.76] back my case and go to the court and sign the settlement, aunt,
[1171.16] I have come out, aunt
[1174.64] and the police will come to catch me,
[1177.48] I will make your life miserable, aunt,
[1179.68] what do you think, I am Bhaktiyog of these jackals of yours,
[1182.92] I am aunt, I don't know you, you
[1186.56] listen to me now, do whatever you want to do, I am
[1190.48] telling you, you will get punished for the crimes you have committed,
[1193.00] and yes, even if
[1196.56] these girls forgive you,
[1198.76] I will not forgive the murder of my husband, get out
[1200.96] of my life and I called you.
[1204.08] Otherwise I will tell you if you don't agree properly

[1397.48] vaccine out.
[1400.62] [Music]
[1406.88] And
[1409.72] O Allah, where did my vaccine go? It was

[1434.92] problem. I have kept it at home.
[1436.76] What do you do?
[1439.12] Look carefully. I have kept it myself. Check it with your own hands. I have
[1441.12] checked in all the stuff here and there. I am
[1443.48] not able to find it. You do one thing,
[1445.60] look in the room or under the bed.

[2106.20] Arham, can I say one thing, if you don't mind,
[2112.00] happiness is in Momina's destiny,
[2115.28] but your mother's jealous
[2118.28] eyes eat away that poor girl's happiness,
[2121.88] what do you mean, what do you want to say,
[2125.80] you
[2128.16] small mouth, big talk, but Momna has no
[2131.44] enemy
[2134.96] except your mother, what are you saying, you are
[2138.24] blaming my mother, I am
[2141.12] not blaming me, I am
[2142.60] telling the truth, it is
[2144.76] visible to everyone, then it
[2147.52] must be happening to you too
[2157.77] [Sangeet]
