Oh, you are lying. Why would we kill the child? Tell me yourself why would we kill him. Okay, we will sit and talk comfortably. You give Sami to me. If he has promised to marry you, I am promising you that I will be able to marry you. And you keep quiet, friend, this is it. You are from our community. I am not just from your community. Our mission is also the same. Give Momna's marriage to me. Okay, let us do one thing. Do you want to do the marriage now or with pomp and show? Right now, we just have to do the Nikaah. The marriage will be done with pomp and show after the marriage. This is it. Oh brother, how are you here and what is all this happening? Brother, the police have come. You got all this done. You are behind all this. I will see you.  I am running away [Music] stop, catch him, catch him, run, don't let him escape [Music] hey, let me go, what have I done, hello Bani, catch him tightly, the one who did it has run away, catch him, we will catch him as well, where will he go, leave me, what have I done, you people don't need to worry at all, I wish he could do it and he hadn't gone too far, but thank God, nothing happened to both of you, if the police hadn't come, he would have killed me, thank God [Music] those people who are close to the heart, when they are taken away from the heart, life becomes so difficult [Music] what's the matter, I'm fine papa, I need a favor from you, the thing that I am going to tell you, only you can understand, what is the matter, speak clearly, don't ask first, wow, you are with me, where have I been, I am at Arar uncle's house, at Arar's house, listen to me completely once, please after that, whatever decision you take, I will accept it, but I definitely want to say that for the first and last time in life, you need only my support  I just want to be with you. Tell me the whole story. Is everything alright there? [Music] [Music] No. [Music] [Laughter] [Music] Yes, I am angry with you. You too left us alone. I wanted to come to you long ago, son. But I didn't have the courage. I did n't have any words to heal your wounds. I thought that if I come here, you would become more sad. Thinking this, I put a stone on my heart. Baba did not do well to us. We left you alone. Aasra neither said anything nor listened to anything. He was the same, son. He who kept his heart in his heart. I too did not do well to him. I left him alone in his extremely difficult time. I wish I had done my duty as a good friend. But if I ask him for forgiveness now, then how? Hey, please forgive me, Akal, please, why are you asking for forgiveness? It's not your fault. You have always tried your best to fulfill your friendship. Maybe only my Baba's fate was such. [Music] When he left this world, no one from his side could give him forgiveness.  They did not have their own [Music] [Music] Uncle, why are you putting yourself and me into a test? If something like this was to happen, it would have happened in Ammi and Baba's life itself, son. Don't you see how nature brings you both in front of each other? Now look at today's matter. Is this not a sign from nature? Uncle, I am happy in your and Baba's happiness. I have time, his life, his future. In fact, I am now only thinking about Abir's marriage. Son, Abir's marriage and Sami's future are not your problems. I am here to face these problems. And look son, if Abrar was alive today, his biggest happiness would have been your and Arham's marriage. He had made a relationship between you two with a lot of love, which our idiot has ruined. Uncle, now there is no use in these things. Time has passed son. If Abrar had desired you [Music], would you have refused him? Look, I am not Abrar, but I want to pay back my negligence by fulfilling his desire. Remember son, if this time passes, there will be only regrets in both of our lives. Please why should I feel shy? [Music] How will I face your aunty? Trust me son, I know that the times to come will not be easy, but I assure you that we both will face this difficulty together and your aunty too. [ Music] Trust Aapi, what are you doing? It's done, it's done Aapi. Just look at this. I am dying. You are busy with preparations. Arham Bhai, for the first time in his life, you have done a manly thing, so you should get the reward for it. Keep it like this. Keep it like this. Mashallah, you are looking cute. Look up, keep smiling, don't be shy. [ Music] I am very happy for you. A person gets life only once and in this one life, one should do everything that his heart says. You are right friend, but if Papa had not supported me, maybe I couldn't have done anything. All this is happening because of Papa. [Music] [Praise] [Music] [ Music] Maybe you can guess.  No, I am getting desperate to see my penis [sangeet] This is too much, you are thinking this is a joke Come on yaar Momina, I am telling you the truth, you think I am lying I am telling you what is in my heart, you think I am joking, I do not like so much bad presumption in life, sometimes a person has to take a risk for his happiness, if you were in my place, then I would ask you that till date I have lived my whole life either according to you or according to mama, see, today for the first time I have taken a decision on my own, so papa is also with us and Fiza, have you told her that where are you at this moment No, I have not told you right now, but after the nika, I will call her first, mama, I have never lied to her, it was just mama's wish, so she wanted me to get married to her and now without his consent, Momina, I do not want to mention anyone in this moment of happiness, either I am there, you are there and I do not need anyone's company [sangeet] Why do you talk so much, what is the matter after all  I will tell you what your problem is sister, look, you listen to me, I swear by Allah, I am such a qualified nurse, I cannot tell you, Allah has given me great healing, any illness, I can cure it very quickly, look at the person, I will be of use to you, you are so beautiful, you will do my work, get me a phone, I will not use it, get you a phone, you have lost your mind, I will get you your phone, you don't have a sister, get me my phone, you have to make one phone call, look, a woman is useful to a woman, look, I will do everything for you, whatever you say, but I am telling you the truth, if you get me a phone, then only I can wash Kas and bring him to you. Lose heart Sajna lost heart Sajna in Lose heart Sajna they lose heart Sajna in Sajna lost heart Sajna in Lose heart Sajna in Sajna [ Music] what is this drama, from where are you people coming and what are these three doing in my house and I had told you not to show me your face again  Show me but you also need a dose of insult after every two-four days. The respect of every person is in his own hands. I did not like this style of yours at all. Am is saying absolutely right. These children were not safe in that house, that is why I have brought them here. Now I am not such a bad person that I will spoil my friend's trust. This is not just your house, it is my house too. And if your relatives can stay here, then these children can also stay here forever. Afan, you will play such a game with me. I did not expect this from you. Okay, don't talk useless things. Go and take rest. Come on, children, you also take rest. You also come, I will show you the guest room downstairs. You stay in this house with these orphans now. But I will not stay in this house even for a moment. Come on, Fiza, you are coming with me. Aunty, what happened? You relax. Why did you fight with uncle or will you leave your house? Uncle has only given shelter to these people, is n't it? Uncle, who is going to marry Arham Momna? Right, Momna, am I right? So I have heard that you are a very self-respecting and sensible girl. You are not the kind of girl who will cause any problem between Uncle and Aunty. Come on, Momna, there is no personal enmity between you and me. In fact, I don't even know you. I heard one thing about you that Arham was engaged to you before me [Sangeet] but I don't care about you because that engagement was broken [laughs] and you are Arham's past while I am Arham's today and Arham's tomorrow [Sangeet] I must tell you one thing, you have earned the right to come to this house but don't think of doing anything that shakes the foundation of this house. You know Aunty gets very angry and in anger she even goes a little crazy [Sangeet], it may happen that Aunty harms herself because of you [Sangeet] or us. I don't know Aunty that much but yes, I respect Uncle a lot. I will not refuse him like my Baba.  I can't say their happiness lies in the fact that I, Abir and Sami stay here. For how long, I don't know [Music] Hey, you are very innocent friend, Ale, but don't act like this innocence in front of me. You know very well what I am trying to explain and tell you. It would be better for you to understand because the uncle you are talking about, no one in this house listens to him, my aunty. Without my aunty's signal even a leaf does not move in this house. But there are some people like you, if you want to take support of any helpless wall, then it is your wish. No one becomes weak by taking support of one's own people. When you are not scared of anything, do n't worry, I will not come in between uncle and aunty.
