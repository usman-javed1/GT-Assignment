I don't have any friends here. All my holidays will go waste, yaar. I swear. If I had even the slightest idea that you are so busy, I would never have come. Fiza, please, I will not go to watch the movie, yaar. I am very tired. I have spent the whole day very busy today. I will not be able to go. You work with Mumma or go with Aariz. In fact, Aariz is very fond of watching movies. Have fun. Listen to me. Are you serious? Okay, I will go alone. But Mumma, I have never misbehaved with Fiza. I did not want to go to watch the movie. I said I will not go. [Music] That's right. You should have gone with her. You will have to change your routine. Fiza wants to spend time with you. She has come after so many days. You guys will have to give some time to understand and know each other. But Mumma, do I need to understand and know more than this? Do I have to spend my whole life with her? Oh, wow, you have chosen your heart.  I have told you about it, now if you spend time together and get to know each other, then it is possible that you will also enjoy spending life together Aunty, decisions of living life are made with the mind, not the heart, why Mr. Arm, oh wow, you turned out to be more intelligent than I thought, let's have dinner on this matter and he will also go out somewhere on my behalf, in fact we will go where Fiza will say, I will call Raj and Jawar as well, I would be grateful if you tell me, actually I had some work, Mama, I did not have any work left, I just told him, now we can at least do this much for Fiza [Music] Nas, thank you Aunty, I will just take the tea, you sit down without insisting like a child, what was the need to come here, oh why, there was no need to come, you have fulfilled all your desires with your first wife, it is my first marriage, I only have these small desires that I have a candle light dinner with my husband, let's go [Music] [Prashant] [Music] [Prashant] Let's go [Music] it's too late Baba has not come home yet. Hey, he never used to be so late. Now their routine has got spoiled. You have taken the responsibility of their child. They were not worried about us earlier. Now they have become careless about Sami as well. I am telling you, everything happened because of you and because of Sami. No, no, your marriage will take place. What all marriages? Why is there only a concern about marriage in this world? Is everything just about marriage? Whoever you see, marriage, marriage, did Baba go there and marry Fata Begum? Why are you looking at it like this? Our Baba has married that nurse. We have a candlelight dinner with her husband. I am thinking that we should leave from here. Why, what happened? Why should we leave from here? You must be thinking that the bill will be high. Do n't worry at all. If the bill comes high, I will pay it. Anyway, our money and yours are not separate, right? From where will this money come? You order in the meantime. [Music] [Music] Better [Music] With the same woman whose name you cannot even bear to take. This relationship is so meaningless, isn't it? Hollow If there is anyone who is the most dishonest in this world, then it is the husband 's wife, the promises he made to her, the oaths he took to her, they bury everything in her grave and give it to some other woman in her place very comfortably They don't give them any gifts, sister, I ca n't believe it sister, the nikahnama of the baba is kept on the table over there, go and see it [Music] Take it [Music] I did not eat, it's good that I accepted your advice, the food is really very tasty, what do you call it, I have never eaten outside, I don't know [Music] I was coming from the ladies room, okay [Music] oh you're late [Music] I'm gone, hey, what happened to your hand, maybe a nail was protruding from the door and got stuck, people make standards but there is nothing like maintenance, I'll complain, I'll go and put a bandage on you, no no, I'm a little health conscious, I'm a doctor only, no no, you don't know, I 'm a qualified nurse, there's nothing unhygienic in my  The doctor nearby will also apply this only, anyway my husband tells me that you keep on moving around I have all the things with me, who knows who will need what at what time, I should keep this with me, it's a deep cut, if I don't apply this at this time, your whole clothes will get torn, thank you, you're welcome, by the way the doctor also does bandage, it's good that you are here [Sangeet], where did you apply it for so long, your food had gone cold, hey, I had already eaten my food, you know, I found a lady in the bathroom, her cut hand was bleeding so profusely that I got worried, I quickly took it out and applied the bandage, she is sitting in front of me, I should apply the bandage on her, it may happen that her clothes get covered in blood [Sangeet] [Sangeet] I think we should go, why should we go, right now you will give me some nice coffee and listen, the coffee here is very good, order it, then you order coffee, I will wait for you in the car, well then I'll also go, where should we stop [Sangeet] so anyway, my  My husband is there, he tells me that you should go then [sangeet] come to pick me up [sangeet ] [ sangeet] [sangeet] [sangeet] [sangeet] [sangeet] I have taken this decision by forcing myself, if maybe that day and all that had not happened with Sami [sangeet] then it would have been a crime for me to even think like this, I should die at the hands of the well-wishers, I thought about her and it was very good that you thought something for Sami, sometimes happiness is found even in forced decisions, now you do one thing, bring that woman to this house, you will stay out of the house at night and we will spend our nights in fear, you [sangeet] have gone mad, that woman whose face I cannot tolerate will come to our house [sangeet] and will stay in Amma's house, in Amma's room, if you people talk to me like this again, I will not forgive you people, you have taken the contract of giving us pain, one's tolerance should not be this high, Baba, this attitude of both of you has forced me to do all this, if you people can take care of brother  If you had taken my turn, then what was the need for me to get married at this old age You didn't even need a child Baba This child took away our mother Aapi's engagement got broken And God knows what all we will have to hear People will only say that your father was fond of hobbies, he does n't see compulsions, he only sees drama Stop appealing All this has happened because of you You are responsible for this Especially you are your brother He is yours If both of you had taken responsibility of him on the first day then what was the need for me to create this drama I didn't want a brother Even without this brother there was no lack in our life Yes you wanted a son And now you got that son's mother so easily You got everything and everything of ours was lost so easily Stop it Abir what was to happen has happened Go to your room Our respect is in our silence Where has the respect you are talking about remained [Music] If that woman comes into this house then I will make her life hell No one can take my mother's place Are you listening Baba don't tell me Baba your Baba is dead Pray that where your mother is  She has gone there, right? I should also go there [Sangeet] Should I go [Sangeet] Good morning everyone Good morning Have you not come at the wrong time? Something has happened? Everyone is like this. Oh no, not at all. Son, you are family. Everything can be discussed in front of you. Aaram ji, I had to talk to you about something important. Are you in a hurry? No, you did not say anything. Your dad's friend and you, Abrar uncle has married for the second time. [Sangeet] And I have heard that his wife is a nurse in some third class hospital. This can never happen. If something like this had happened, Abrar would have definitely told me. I meet Momna every day. Aaram also, she did not tell you this. [Sangeet] I am also missing you a lot. [ Sangeet] I am not able to understand a lot. [Sangeet] I cannot understand how someone can be missed so much. [Sangeet] I can understand. The pain of separation from mother does not go away. In fact, the older it gets, the more it hurts. You cry to your heart's content, your heart will become lighter. You know that when mother goes away, the prayers that even that which gives us sorrow, is taken away from us.  She would protect him from the cold and heat. By the way Aram I wanted to hear this from you but if you knew then you would have definitely told me, right? Anyway this is their personal matter. I was just trying to confirm whether Abrar has married that third grade woman or not. I mean this is not really a disgusting situation. There is nothing like that. You have misunderstood. If something like that had happened then Abrar would have definitely told me. And I was in favour of his marriage. Brother, all his problems will be solved if he gets married. It does n't make sense. But if he does it then it is very good. He should have done it. I don't think it was good. Ex. I am in my room. I will talk to Abraaj today itself. What happened to him? For God's sake, leave those people alone. The time to talk and support them has passed. If you do this then there will be a change in Aram as well. He will also come out of the cage of beliefs and will see this world with the eyes of reality. And this is very good for Aram. Believe me that  There is no benefit to me in this. I only want Aram's happiness. Not this everyday drama. What does marriage have to do with Aram's happiness? Bye Dave, where do you keep meeting me? It may or may not be related to happiness, but I am happy. And now you will see that there will be no place for Mamna in Arham's life. I know my son this much. [Music] Hi Momina, I just want to hear the truth. You knew everything, right? Uncle must have told you why Uncle married that woman for the second time. And just let my Baba marry her and you are putting me in the dock. As soon as I came to know, I first called you and asked why Baa married that nurse. I do n't know, and neither do I want to know. Friend, Uncle did not do the right thing by marrying that woman. I only know this. Okay, we have no right to interfere in somebody else's personal life and comment. But still, it is not such that I should keep you and myself away from this. You know, what Baba did will neither benefit us, nor  Sami, if anyone will benefit then it will only be this aunty, maybe that is why she came to our house, I don't know what happened to your father, you should have considered your age, friend, please, if you want to give me a decision, then do tell me, anyway so much has happened to me that I am not scared of anyone's hands or shock now, just wait a minute, what do you want, I should happily welcome your new mother and then go and explain to my mother, don't explain, don't explain to your mother, if you want to leave from here or tell me, tell her, if you want to leave from here, then go away, in fact, now I also want that you leave from here and never come back, the memories of the good days between us are enough, I do n't have the courage to bear anything, well I have not reached the limit of pity, I have the courage to understand the truth and accept it, I am distant from what my father did, but still I love my father very much, loving him is natural in me, if someone insults him or makes fun of him, I don't like this  You cannot tolerate all these things, why don't you go and explain all these things to your father, because it is not so easy to explain to parents, if it were so easy then today we would have been together in your house [ Music] [Music] you know what, even today I am fighting with Mama for your company, if you had realized this, then you wouldn't have taunted me, don't do this today, don't do this favor, where there is favor, the feeling ends, please, please don't be sorry for me [Music] I am really longing for you [Music] [ Music] [ Music] [ Music] [Music]
