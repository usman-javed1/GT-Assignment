[154.08] support you, if tomorrow these two get

[466.08] awesome and lovely boy Hey brother Momna
[468.92] how are you
[471.12] here well
[474.56] brother have you come to do shopping for the little baby
[477.92] yes actually I had not given him any gift so I
[480.64] brought it for him only
[482.96] son if you people must have thought then you must have
[486.76] thought something good
[488.08] I thought that I should also
[491.52] buy some things for Sami he
[494.88] is a very simple person now how would he know how to do
[497.36] shopping for kids so I myself said do
[499.68] n't worry I will take
[501.52] you for shopping Hey Sami is getting bigger than usual Mashallah so
[504.36] at his age clothes get
[506.56] small very quickly and anyway it is
[509.80] not good to have only one feeder so give the child
[512.08] two or four  Feeders should be kept in the house,
[514.52] why
[515.52] bhai
[518.08] ji? Thank you Ada, I will take care of this. I
[522.44] thank you, you people have just arrived. Please
[524.92] carry on, I will drop Mora home. And
[528.72] thank you very much, you thought so much about Sami. No
[531.68] one thinks these days. Thank you, hey
[536.36] son, what is the point of thanks. Just help Ira sahab a
[539.32] little. Don't you think, he is a
[542.12] motherless child, if we take care of him, then
[544.96] Allah will definitely reward us.
[547.68] Anyway, I feel very attached to children.
[549.72] I have been telling Avra ​​sahab for a long time,
[552.00] brother, please give it to me. I will raise it, I will take
[554.80] care of it. Anyway, I am on night duty, I am
[556.84] busy the whole day. It is
[558.96] good, I will be able to focus on the child. And
[561.40] anyway, look son,
[564.20] you people trusted him once and saw him. Now I do
[566.92] n't think that we should take any risk. No,
[571.24] Sami is now in safe hands. Whatever happened to him
[575.28] due to our negligence, it will not happen again. Well,
[579.92] Inshallah, it will be exactly the same.
[583.96] Arar sahab, your daughter turned out to be very intelligent.
[586.80] You did not do anything unnecessarily because of this.  They remain upset, just
[589.48] look how the sun and moon are a pair, let's not
[592.68] waste time now, let's get
[595.00] them married quickly, I think
[596.84] we should leave now, it will be late, yes, we should definitely
[599.24] go, ok daughter, thank
[606.08] you Momina, I think you have forgotten to speak
[610.24] or the conversation between us has ended,
[613.04] we both have been sitting silent for so long, this is not strange, I was
[617.84] just thinking something, what are you thinking,
[621.80] life is so unpredictable, no,
[625.72] what we think and what happens,
[629.08] who will be with us and who will not, no one
[631.52] tells us anything, but still we
[634.76] plan so many things, I was
[637.36] enjoying the talks of your fam aunty, they are a
[639.48] pair of moon and the sun,
[642.12] both look so good together,
[645.76] may Allah accept their prayers soon,
[648.16] ram,
[650.92] please, I am not happy,
[654.32] your mumma has ended our relationship,
[658.04] look, it's my life and my relationship
[662.12] too, if I don't want to end it, then
[664.88] nobody can end it, but what the parents
[667.08] say is everything, of course,
[670.44] but if mumma loves her Ana, then
[676.68] look at me, I am meeting you after so many days,
[679.04] I am meeting you  I only
[680.56] want to see you happy. I have so much lack of confidence in my life that I ca
[683.68] n't be happy anymore. Momna, I
[687.16] agree that there is a lot in our lives,
[690.12] but you should believe me. I
[694.08] cannot separate you from my life.
[696.00] Despite trying, you still want me to
[699.32] believe you. I
[702.20] can trust you.
[705.72] Ram, why do you want me to keep getting humiliated in front of aunty again and again. I
[719.48] know my respect is more important than this trust. But you should also remember one thing.
[723.32] You are not my stubbornness. [Sangeet
[727.01] ] You are
[728.32] my respect.
[730.56] [Sangeet]
[742.44] Hora sahab, I don't like foolish men
[747.08] at all.
[750.24] And you shouldn't have put this bell in your street.
[752.36] When you didn't even have the courage to ring it,
[755.12] what are you saying? Do
[759.68] n't call my desire my cowardice.
[762.36] [Sangeet]
[764.08] I wanted Sami to go into safe hands
[768.56] and along with that, I also want
[771.48] that your status and respect remain in my house.
[775.12] Your child has gone into safe hands.
[779.36] Your daughter has done such a good job.
[787.12] I don't think you need this marriage.
[791.80] End it.  Let's
[795.52] see when and where someone is needed, no
[799.80] one can tell this,
[802.32] you eat food, Inshallah Allah will do good,
[806.84] Allah does good only, the flaw lies
[810.40] in the intentions of a person, it would have been
[813.92] good if you got married after consulting your daughters,
[821.52] this marriage may be a compulsion for you,
[824.92] but you should believe me, there was no flaw in my intentions,
[829.64] I
[833.96] want to spend my life with you and your children with very good intentions
[836.16] and my Allah knows this, it will happen,
[842.76] our intentions are clear, Allah will do better,
[846.64] I had put all my happiness, my
[850.28] emotions to sleep,
[855.04] then when you came in my life, I felt that this is how the
[858.80] path would have been, husband, children, Sami is a
[864.88] piece of my heart, he is very dear to me,
[869.36] I want Bara Sahab to serve you a lot, take
[872.24] care of your house,
[878.32] raise your children like a mother and all this is
[880.68] my legitimate wish,
[885.56] I think it is your responsibility to fulfill all these things,
[893.40] Bhaki, let's eat food, it became cold, it was
[897.56] a lot of fun,
[903.60] we have nothing else, Mau is enough for you,
[911.12] Baba, is it with that nurse  Were you doing shopping
[914.24] or
[916.00] Allah Baba will also be friends with such people
[919.36] can't believe
[921.72] it yes remember one thing of mine
[925.44] when we leave the doors of our house open
[929.76] then anyone can come in
[932.72] Sami is Baba's life
[936.28] and anyone can take advantage of this and
[939.88] make a place in Baba's heart and in this house
[942.44] too yes they
[944.64] can do anything for him
[947.84] but what has happened to you why have you
[950.68] become his nanny for
[952.12] Allah's sake you should use your brain
[955.15] [Music]
[956.44] today I tolerated this because of brother
[959.56] otherwise I am
[961.96] not interested in this
[964.18] [Music]
[969.40] Aapi Arham Bhai is trying to bridge the distance
[973.80] [Music] support him and what will happen if I
[978.28] support him or if you say so and
[982.44] we have to do only what Atul aunty will
[985.72] say he has said this to you do
[992.64] n't look please don't make any plans with him now let
[998.88] him move ahead in his life
[1001.68] he wants to move ahead taking you along
[1003.52] in his life Aapi understand this thing anal mya anal anal
[1007.12] anal now his eyes meet ammi's
[1013.60] na did he miss
[1017.48] me
[1018.48] [Music]
[1028.52] in Shagufta Marhama's life when he  People were
[1030.96] ready for marriage, so what is the
[1033.84] obstacle now? And
[1036.40] by the way, your friends are very good
[1039.92] people, you should talk to them,
[1043.36] sometimes a father has to bow his head in the matter of a daughter,
[1046.32] and there is nothing wrong in it. If there is a
[1050.56] proper relationship between the two families,
[1054.60] how can it break because of someone's saying? I am
[1057.12] afraid of Atul Bhabhi's thinking and attitude.
[1060.56] Afan has
[1063.32] supported me in every difficult time.
[1067.24] This relationship was also fixed on his wish. I don't
[1070.92] understand what enmity Atul Bhabhi has with
[1076.40] me. She would
[1079.64] find some reason or the other to reprimand me.
[1083.76] But when the boy and the girl agree, what can they do?
[1088.24] By the way, I like Aram very much. He is
[1091.84] absolutely fit for our Momna. And what
[1097.72] better do you want than a boy who even angers his mother for his would-be wife?
[1100.72] Angering your mother is also
[1103.44] not a proper thing.
[1105.04] Okay, Momna's judge should have his place for religion,
[1110.24] but see, these relationships
[1113.16] should be done with the consent of the two families, only
[1117.92] then they would be successful.
[1119.24] But see, Araj sahab's family was agreeable,
[1124.60] only then it worked.  It was fixed, right? So what's the
[1127.56] issue now? Just let's get married and see. By the
[1132.88] way, I'm afraid that
[1135.48] both of them are very young. If they get
[1138.52] carried away and do something wrong, then the
[1141.08] blame will not fall on the children but on the parents. Let's
[1144.68] see how young the age is. And
[1149.52] I like it very much. It's very good
[1151.52] for our mother. It's very
[1155.96] cute
[1157.36] too. You should talk to me soon. You've become very
[1167.24] handsome,
[1172.24] sir. But you can't get away with
[1175.76] it. I'm very angry.
[1178.28] Why won't you be with me
[1180.68] in such a long time? No phone call. No
[1186.64] reply to any of my messages. And
[1189.48] look at me, I remember one thing about
[1194.48] you. I don't know if you're in my destiny
[1197.20] or not.
[1199.20] [Music]
[1201.96] If you're very close to my heart. Hey,
[1207.32] beware. If you show up like this, do
[1210.40] you have the courage? Come out of the picture
[1215.14] [Music]
[1223.04] Hi,
[1227.16] handsome
[1230.74] [Music]
[1235.60] Why didn't you come to
[1238.36] pick me up, friend? When a friend comes after such a long time, then a
[1241.64] little protocol is a must.
[1247.32] And if a stranger enters your room without permission, then
[1252.84] what should you do with him?
[1256.04] Hold his hand and take him out of the room.  I
[1258.52] want right
[1261.24] Arham, you take me out of your room, I will
[1266.36] kill you with a bang
[1270.68] Hey, you guys are behaving as if we
[1274.08] meet everyday
[1275.64] Arham, see how lovely and elegant the atmosphere has become
[1281.38] [Sangeet]
[1283.20] Thanks for the complete aunty, actually I was
[1287.12] expecting this complete thing from us,
[1289.08] but okay, you know that
[1293.08] in terms of expressing, this did
[1295.64] not
[1297.32] go anywhere with you and you know aunty that I
[1301.80] believe in expressing openly [Sangeet]
[1319.65] [Sangeet]
[1340.44] [Sangeet]
[1347.86] [Sangeet]
[1349.68] Abrar sahab, get up, you
[1352.72] slept late last night, you will get late for office
[1364.08] Hey, if you just disconnect the phone, one
[1373.80] should not marry married people, it is only harmful, their desires are already dead, so
[1394.28] Famida
[1396.64] Begum hello hello, how are you Famida Begum hey, you
[1401.44] called me early in the morning, are you fine,
[1404.20] wow, what can I say to you, first you
[1407.12] hung up the phone in my face and now you are asking
[1409.24] why did I call you, but I did
[1412.24] not disconnect your call, rather I
[1416.20] picked up my phone immediately  I have just
[1417.92] opened my eyes on your phone, why are you getting angry without any reason,
[1420.92] yes brother, why would anyone believe me now? I
[1423.88] thought I slept late last night, I might get
[1426.64] late for office, I am
[1429.48] just fulfilling my duty as a wife, and let me also
[1431.64] tell you that I am not
[1433.44] fully aware of my responsibilities, let's get up, get ready, we are getting late for
[1437.56] office,
[1449.00] where has Sami gone
[1451.08] [Music]?
[1458.92] Oh my
[1461.16] God, Famida Begum is right,
[1464.84] it means Momna heard this call,
[1471.28] Fata Begum is a very stupid woman anyway
[1477.28] [Music], I do
[1481.28] n't know what Momna will think about us,
[1492.92] what should we do,
[1494.60] Baba, can't you see this, what has happened, he is crying, he is not
[1498.44] quiet at all,
[1501.68] Samimi, what happened, son, it's a bad thing, son, don't
[1505.24] bother your sister, it's such a bad thing, no, don't
[1508.92] bother her, you are a good child, I will do
[1512.60] one thing, I will call Famida,
[1515.28] if she has time, she will come and
[1517.40] check it, but she is just a
[1518.96] nurse, not a doctor,
[1522.48] but son, that nurse is for children,
[1529.92] you let it be, I will do one thing, my friend's
[1533.80] Ami  He is a child specialist. Anyway I had to go to meet
[1536.00] him. I will go there
[1537.60] and take Sami along too.
[1539.56] Okay. And I will get some practice as well. I will get to know
[1542.32] what is needed and what is not.
[1545.48] Okay, son. As you
[1549.92] wish, you get ready, I will drop you.
[1554.84] No, Baba, you eat your breakfast comfortably and
[1558.84] go to the office. Give him to me. I will stay with Sami and take
[1562.60] care of him. You know, I am
[1566.08] also looking for tips on G that
[1567.64] how to be a good mother to children.
[1577.84] Mamna,
[1580.16] Mamna, son, don't make him addicted to me.
[1583.80] I will get you married too.
[1586.60] Baba, Sami will now stay with me.
[1592.52] Now the one who wants to marry me should think. [Music
[1599.89] ]
[1601.20] Take my child, let me put him to sleep. You have your
[1605.20] breakfast. He will cool down.
[1606.84] [Music]
[1616.16] You have confused me.
[1619.36] This is a strange coward. Your brother
[1621.68] acts giggly in front of his daughters. Not
[1623.48] a word comes out of his mouth. That man is not a
[1625.92] coward, he is a wise man. The
[1629.76] poor guy got trapped after getting married. Oh, to hell with all this,
[1632.48] what was the use of being wise?  Brother, repent, they have kept
[1636.12] me sitting at home, they are not
[1638.72] taking me home at all, it's good that I didn't
[1641.04] leave my job in the hospital, otherwise you
[1643.16] know how I would have been, by the way, what do they
[1644.96] call it, yes, the washerman's dog, neither of the house nor of the
[1647.88] pot, disappointment is not such a good thing,
[1651.24] now you see, after marriage,
[1653.48] how much glow has come on your face, this is when the
[1656.84] companionship of a man becomes complete, oh, what kind of
[1660.12] companionship is it, a wife, by force, I took them out for dinner,
[1662.28] that too on the pretext of shopping for the child
[1664.64] and what happened there, do
[1666.24] you know, their daughter and future son in law dropped in, it is a matter of
[1668.64] great happiness that you
[1671.92] met your future son in law, he is a
[1674.48] very nice boy, despite all this,
[1677.96] see, he did not leave Momna's side, his
[1679.76] mother does not want the marriage to happen,
[1682.84] but the father and son are adamant on the issue,
[1685.48] brother, this means that I will have to treat their mother
[1687.60] also, otherwise I would
[1689.68] keep hanging like this all my life, not knowing

[1815.84] Hafiz first of all you don't take me to your house
[1818.48] and on top of that you have taken all the food and water of my house on
[1822.20] yourself this doesn't
[1825.00] seem appropriate
[1828.04] but thank God I have a job I am
[1831.64] managing at home see what I
[1835.32] find appropriate right now I am trying to do that I have
[1839.48] married you I have the responsibility of your non-wife
[1842.76] you are
[1845.88] not doing me a favour I am fine you
[1856.24] seem a bit worried
[1859.32] Sami is fine
[1862.00] by the way I keep asking Zeba about Sami's well being I
[1865.84] am his real mother
[1869.76] otherwise I feel that I don't even have that much right
[1875.44] on him right now you talk very nicely
[1879.32] hey
[1881.72] sometimes  I laugh remembering your words. It is my
[1885.20] good
[1887.80] fortune that you remembered me.
[1896.08] Tell me what is the
[1898.44] matter. What are you hiding from
[1904.80] me. The wish that everything would be fine in life is getting
[1909.04] fulfilled.
[1912.16] Momna is becoming very dear to me.
[1917.68] Now even when I pick her up in my lap, she becomes restless.
[1921.96] But you do not have the courage to
[1925.00] talk to your children about us.
[1931.72] Tell her, how long will this
[1936.76] continue? Now the people in the neighbourhood have started talking. They are
[1940.88] right in saying that when I am married,
[1944.80] I should stay in my husband's house.
[1948.68] And then he sees you coming and going in this house everyday. It does
[1952.56] not
[1956.24] feel good. Now tell me, when will we talk?
[1959.95] [Sangeet]
[1964.16] I will try to talk to Momna today.
[1968.68] She is my very sensible daughter. Yes, if she
[1971.88] shows understanding in your matter, then please
[1974.08] forgive me.
[1978.04] Your daughters are very happy. They should have got you married themselves. Has
[1985.16] anyone ever thought that
[1988.76] what will happen to you when both of them will become of their own homes? No
[1992.96] one thinks about you.
[2000.96] You are not worried.
