Haara dil sajana ve Haara dil sajana ve O [Music] Sajna taalia Pink eyes when I saw you, my heart has become drunk, take care of me, O my friends, it has become difficult to control myself La lala lalala la la la lala lala Why are you so quiet Your eyes and your face are not supporting your silence like this [Music] Why am I not quiet I am talking to everyone and since when have you started talking about my face and my eyes Ever since we came here I have been looking at your face and reading your eyes Funny we have come here in just a few hours [Music] So what difference does it make There are some people of such a type with whom you meet once and decide that you should meet them again and again We talk well, I mean I only talk well I am not a good person myself, don't know I haven't thought so much I mean I have never looked at you so carefully, so look, think, you have enough time Hey, is there any compulsion  If I don't think about it then it cannot happen that you don't think about me You are challenging me No, I am not challenging me, I don't have any idea, my Faraz please listen to me once, neither am I passing time with you nor do I have any intention to flood you Now if these two things are removed then only friendship remains between two people, is n't it? Is there any problem in that too? How are you doing like this Faraz, how can you think so much in one meeting? Yes, I mean I have thought about it, you can also think about it, but keep one thing in mind, I am not used to hearing no, this also happens, wow Abir, your [sangeet] luck [ sangeet] you know [sangeet] Baba was angry with Abhi and left this world in anger [sangeet] He did not give her a chance to convince him, he kept on going like this I called Abhi many times, she is very unlucky [sangeet] she did not pick up even a single phone She could not even see Baba for the last time [sangeet] She must be thinking of excuses, she must be thinking what will she say to Baba when she returns [Music] What does she know? There is no one here to listen to her excuses, to listen to her stories. [Music] There is no one left to scold her. No one will be there now. Ami will ask Baba, on whose support did he leave his daughters at such a young age? Who is there after them? [Music] We have no one. Look, I am standing alone, I have no one. [Music] Why did you people leave me alone and go away? [Music] What will I do in this house? I have no one with me. No one, neither you nor me. [Music] [Music] Baba [Prashan] Ala ja, what has happened? If I got two minutes of sleep, it would have been a disaster. I am awake the whole day and night. Now, when I fell asleep a little, the boy started getting quiet. What are you people talking about? The kind of things I should have talked about earlier. It hasn't been a day since my husband died. I have become a widow now and I am feeling very bad about my sleep. I have no concern with your sleep. But if you let Sami sleep with you,  If you had taken him then you can take care of him too, if the children's head gets hurt, it might affect their brain, all the intelligent people have been born in my fate, I am the only mad person left here, listen to me, wife, pick him up and take care of him yourself, have you understood, otherwise if something happens to Kara tomorrow, you will say that aunty poisoned him and killed him, I will not raise someone else's child, I don't know if he is your brother or [Music] Son, what are you saying, I am saying the same thing which I should have said a long time ago, take this, hold all his stuff, his father has died, I have understood, I will not raise his headache, now I don't need him, take this, the milk box, Baba, everyone, do n't come to my room to take anything, get out of here, go out of my room and now if I see you and this child in my room then look at me, you don't let me see, you have ruined my [Music] my [ Music] [Music] [Music] [ Music] [Praise] [Music] [Praise] [Music] [Music] I was thinking that you would wait for me for tea  You are not used to waiting, this is a very good thing, this shows that you have a lot of similar habits as mine, will you marry me, Faraz, are you joking, I am serious, look, after I leave from here, I will send my mother to your house, they will then fix the date of marriage, do you have any objection? Today, you do not even know me or my family, we have met on a tour and this is not such a big decision, you tell me what do you know about me, nothing and you said such a big thing, I like you, that is enough for me and listen, I have a lot of friends and I don't know why, I don't feel like getting married and I feel yes, look at what a nice smile you have, I promise you, I will keep you very happy, there is a lot of difference, where did the topic of our class come in between [sangeet], anyway, I did not come to your house, you came to my house [sangeet] and your parents, my mother, she is a business woman and has very liberal thoughts, she divorced my dad only because both of them felt that he  People cannot be happy and when it came to my custody, I preferred to live with my mother and your father, he lives in England and is very happy with his wife and children and the infact point is that we all are happy in our own worlds. If your mother has any problem with my family, then first of all it will not happen and even if it happens, it does not matter to me. I am a thief, I am established, I do not need anyone's permission for my marriage, but if I do not accept your proposal, then yes this is a very important point, I did not even think about it that what will happen if you reject it, what will happen, by the way, you will wake up from sleep at night and will remember me, after all I am not a piece of cake that you can ignore me so easily, send your mother to my house, then we will see who cries in whose memory, oh really, who all are there in your house, in my house [sangeet] there is no mother, there is an elder sister, Mamna, younger brother and  Baba is here, this is my family, Baba was not happy when I came here without his permission, he will be very angry with me and now you are thinking that what will happen if you go back, you have fulfilled your stubbornness but still there is guilt in your heart, you are right, I should not have come here, but when Baba refused to come here, I thought that this is the right thing, so no problem, I will come with you, talk to your Baba, you will talk to my Baba, no they will kill both of us and they will think that I was trying to come here because of you and they will not believe that we are meeting for the first time, when I am ready to take the responsibility of his stubborn daughter for the whole life, then they will be happy to hear this, Baba will never be happy with me, I know this, nothing like this is going to happen, you go and say a small sorry to him and use the magic of sorry, then tell me what happened [Sangeet] [Sangeet] [Sangeet] went [Sangeet] itself also happened but this girl did not come back home [Sangeet] I do n't know whether she will come or not  Will she not come back or will she elope with someone else from there? Why are you asking me all this? This is a matter of your family. You should know. I am asking you because Nayla is Abir's friend. But look sir, did Nayla go with her college friends? If Abir left the house despite her father's refusal? I have not given my Nayla the hope that she should have relations with anyone and she does not have any friendship with that Khusra girl. Have you ever seen Nayla coming or going here? She is a very rude and ill-mannered girl. I am afraid that if she comes back, I do n't know what a big drama she will create. May Allah come back, otherwise we will read about her too. She must have eloped with someone. By the way, only Allah is the protector of this house. Hey, why is Allah the protector of this house, brother? What should I give in dying? Now after the marriage of the husband, the whole house is mine. After all, I am a widow. Now, what have you talked about on this occasion? Read all the women.  She is looking at our face, the Quran is kept for Ammi [Music] Hammy's Quran is not to be kept, it is Baba's himself, do you understand, Baba's himself [Music] himself, why have you come today [Music] why have you come, why have you come to see this tamasha, why have you come, go back to those people with whom you have spent the best times of your life, why have you come [Music] ho [Music] Baba look at the drum [Music] [Music] Baba [Music] Ba, how did you leave me, Baba, how did you leave me [Music] you [Music] Baba, you gave me such a big punishment for my stubbornness, Baba, you gave me such a big punishment, Baba [Music] I used to fight with you, I used to quarrel with you, but Baba, it was my love, Baba, it was my love [Music] Baba could never understand my love, Baba, why could I not understand, Baba, I could not understand, Baba, Baba, you know I always wanted, always wanted that you were different from all, you were different from all, Baba, but when you also behaved like others, Baba, then I felt very bad, I felt very bad, Baba, I felt very bad [Music] [Praise] Baba just once, just once, come in front of me Baba just once, Baba you kill me, kill me, Baba kill me, kill me, give me whatever punishment you want to give me Baba, but do n't do this to me, don't do this to me, Baba don't give me such a big punishment Baba, give me such a big understanding Baba, I want to talk to you a lot Baba, you are my dear Baba, I want to talk to you a lot Baba, just once listen to me Baba, listen to my sorry Baba, I want to say sorry, listen to my sorry Baba, listen to my sorry Baba, I will show you that I am a very good daughter I will not say anything about Sami also, I will not say anything about anyone, I will not say anything about anyone, I will show you that I am a good daughter Baba, come in front of me once Baba, just once come in front of me, please please Baba don't do this to me, for the sake of Allah, don't give me such a big punishment Baba, please please Baba, please Baba, I want that coolness Baba which you used to give me when I was with Ammi.

Tell me what did the police say. What will the police say? If they find any clue, they will tell us. And if they don't find it, then this case file will just lie there in a corner. No one will ask. This won't happen. What are you going to do? Please, for God's sake, don't do anything. It's only you. I have already heard so much because of you. So much has come. I don't have the courage. Please, no one's father has the courage to say anything. It was Baba because of whom I used to tolerate these deceitful people. Now you see, I am not going to listen to anyone.
