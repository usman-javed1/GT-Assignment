[0.24] Hara Dil Sajna Ve Hara Dil Sajna
[6.32] Ve
[20.43] [Music]
[28.96] Sajna Lane ji your soup is here
[33.96] hot it was time to come when you had to rest and
[37.68] I
[42.12] served you I do not remember ever
[46.20] seeing you lying on the bed with Abir and Momna
[49.28] I would just come to the hospital to see them, I do
[53.96] not remember if I ever
[57.16] held them in my lap you are right that unlike all other men
[60.92] you never held Momna and Aveer
[63.40] in your lap happily and
[66.88] now it seems as if your feet are not staying on the ground you are going to be the
[71.64] father of a son I am
[76.60] surprised at myself
[80.72] you had such a strong desire for a son
[86.00] and I never got to know about it
[92.96] yes so what is the fault in this
[95.48] you are unnecessarily doing drama of being emotional
[99.44] okay I had a desire for a son which
[103.12] Allah fulfilled
[106.45] [Music]
[109.44] I have never complained to you all my life if you had
[113.00] such a strong desire then you should have told me
[117.36] I would have arranged for your second marriage what
[120.80] useless things are you saying for two minutes
[123.64] Also think that the
[126.32] void of a brother is going to be filled in Momna and Abir's life
[128.94] [Sangeet]
[132.52] This brother will not become their support but will
[136.24] become a burden on them
[137.85] [Sangeet]
[139.12] At this age children are not normal but
[141.88] now normal children are born She is such a
[143.44] big doctor She was getting
[146.44] angry at me What
[150.00] nonsense are you talking about You are cruel and thankful
[153.08] women You do
[155.80] not know how to thank Allah
[158.28] We will not be dependent on anyone in our old age,
[162.24] right? Hey daughters, what was the point of
[165.16] sitting with you all our lives
[167.63] [Sangeet]
[182.25] [Sangeet]
[186.04] Many congratulations to both of you Son
[193.33] [Sangeet] You
[198.52] are [Sangeet]
[206.12] Momna everything will be fine
[213.29] [Sangeet]
[225.12] Where are you, you are not
[228.68] seen We met at the wedding and today you are
[234.56] working on a special project For me
[238.12] every project is special
[241.08] You tell me, have you fallen in love with this house I mean
[245.00] you are comfortable I am
[248.32] comfortable but this
[251.36] house is not new for me But why do I feel that
[254.96] because of me you are uncomfortable
[258.52] If you are feeling so then it must be right
[260.48] What should I start talking about?  The two of you have
[263.96] cooked I have cooked your favourite dish
[265.88] Start eating
[268.60] You have prepared your favourite dish on your timetable I
[272.36] am a guest why are you ruining my habit
[276.60] Jwar don't worry about it there is no
[280.96] chance of anyone's habit getting ruined here
[283.08] At the end only that happens here what Mama
[287.40] wants must happen to you
[289.88] because you don't use your brain
[294.41] [Music]
[298.56] Oh
[301.04] Oh, how are you talking to your sister
[305.33] [Music]
[307.84] Excuse me
[312.00] [Music]
[320.28] [Music]
[328.48] What does this have to do with your marriage
[332.80] You are afraid that we will
[336.96] leave you and go after getting married I will not
[339.84] go I will always stay with you I will do my job I will
[343.00] stay as you say I will just be
[345.08] with you
[346.08] Rangi please get yourself checked by a good doctor
[349.84] and get rid of this problem nothing can be done now I have
[355.88] already discussed all this with your father before talking to you it's
[360.64] too late
[362.88] and it's not so easy to end all this
[366.96] my condition is
[369.67] [Music]
[382.56] Look Baba is not worried about our mother he is
[385.92] worried about that son
[389.96] that son who is still  There is so much erasing in this world. I am
[398.08] unable to understand
[400.88] how to explain it to you. Ami, I
[402.56] care so much for you. Don't explain it to me, rather
[406.56] explain it to yourself. Now what was to happen has happened.
[409.13] [Sangeet]
[418.40] Gaya
[422.20] [Sangeet]
[424.20] What's the problem? Api,
[425.72] you neither sleep nor let others sleep.
[431.86] [Sangeet]
[438.48] Then has anything new happened? It's not
[443.36] new,
[445.80] but it has definitely become absurd.
[450.92] What's
[454.48] absurd? And have we brother made a plan to elope? I mean, this is what
[460.56] happens in these situations,
[471.64] in what situation? Your needle is still stuck there.
[475.36] My needle is stuck, your
[477.88] life is stuck. Api,
[481.28] how long will this go on like this?
[484.28] Ammi is also very worried. I had
[487.48] no idea. She is so tensed about your marriage.
[490.92] She has taken the tension herself.
[496.80] I mean, look,
[502.48] what is the need to have so many expectations from Aunty Tola
[503.57] [Sangeet] Well,
[505.04] there is one thing.
[508.24] If Arham bhai wants, then everything can be fine.
[514.80] I myself also don't want Arham to do anything.
[519.12] Now I don't want him to do anything at all.
[525.28] Go to sleep.
[527.03] [Sangeet]
[536.32] Okay, listen, at least turn off the light.
[541.56] I know the light.  I can't sleep.
[547.12] Always remember one thing.
[550.04] We have to speak very carefully in front of our younger brother
[552.76] because these are
[556.48] relationships of a husband and a wife. We should never reveal our
[558.80] weaknesses to them. Your
[562.08] son is sharing his weaknesses. I had no idea that the girl would take over Aram's
[565.32] mind in this way.
[569.28] [Music] Were
[570.44] you thinking it was a routine affair? Stop it.
[572.72] It was a routine affair which you
[575.80] encouraged. I feel very sorry for
[578.32] your thinking.
[579.88] I am also a father of a daughter.
[583.28] How can I think ill of someone else's daughter?
[585.32] And if Aariz deserves a
[588.68] good partner and a good home in her life,
[591.44] then why not Momna? You are comparing my Aariz
[595.44] with Momna.
[597.64] I am feeling sorry for your thinking
[601.28] and she has also started dreaming of a big house there.
[604.64] I am sorry
[607.08] Atul. Your approach is completely wrong.
[611.60] You always
[615.00] weigh relationships on the scale of wealth and I
[619.48] judge a person by his qualities. Momna has all those
[622.52] qualities which are enough for my son's happiness.
[624.24] And that's why I will support Arham
[628.04] You do whatever you want
[639.15] [Music]
[641.91] [Praise]
[642.98] [Music]
[645.32] Who is this Momina She is Haram's girlfriend
[650.52] and he wants to marry her She is a girlfriend Wow so
[655.00] when is the marriage Never never Never hey it's
[660.84] Arham's life what's the
[663.52] problem with you Baa What happened a while ago is
[666.96] your reaction to this never
[670.40] This might be my problem but it
[673.52] can never be your problem
[676.04] Please don't try to impose your so called philosophy on me
[678.88] I'm just
[682.32] asking you why are you liking it
[686.68] Mom and her family used to live in Annecy
[690.00] now it's obvious that Mumma is not going to make her her daughter in law There is
[694.20] a lot of tension going on because of that so
[697.92] does our Auntie Jaan also does charity work
[700.68] and that too at this level I'm quite
[704.96] impressed Mumma has
[707.24] no interest in charity This is a gift from our grandmother
[709.72] I thank Momna's father met her somewhere
[712.72] on the footpath then she brought her home She was
[716.16] found on the footpath
[720.40] how could a person pick her up like this and bring her home  There was a
[724.08] flood in those days and
[727.28] they lost everything. Why are you
[730.20] taking so much interest in all this? The
[732.44] matter is something like this [
[735.18] Sangeet]
[749.72] [Sangeet]
[774.80] why did you get up?
[777.08] I was preparing breakfast
[780.48] and
[784.48] anyway, in this condition, you should take rest. You are feeling
[790.48] very happy, aren't you? After disrespecting your mother,
[794.36] leave this work to your father. You
[797.32] go and get ready. I am
[799.64] not sick that I can take rest. I
[804.32] agree that this change has come in my existence after many years,
[810.64] but I have enough courage to bear its burden.
[814.80] Don't be worried, I will not trouble
[818.56] you people. I will not put you in trouble.
[822.17] [Sangeet]
[837.76] change,
[841.60] change,
[843.84] not happiness
[850.49] [Sangeet]
[864.08] what happened, that's why it's fine. Come, I'll take
[868.80] you to the doctor. You are becoming
[871.68] weak day by day. You don't take care of yourself at all. Fear God,
[874.28] why are you
[877.00] torturing yourself? Now I'll take you
[880.24] to the doctor.
[889.44] Sit here. Now, what will the doctor do?
[892.48] Weakness in the head is inevitable.
[896.12] Yes, that's fine, but
[900.64] what happened,
[901.72] mummy, I am having a headache.
[905.12] Baba, take mummy to some good doctor.  Let's
[908.28] take him to a specialist or else we'll check

[915.28] dizzy

[945.60] not going to the doctor right now I'll
[948.36] bring hot milk for you
[951.69] [Music]
[959.03] [Music] what is

[994.80] cry should I get angry what should I do you are
[997.76] so intelligent that how can you do this
[1000.04] [Music]
[1002.76] people will make fun of
[1006.40] us so much why will they make fun of us the
[1009.64] whole world has children and what is this
[1012.20] unusual thing well I haven't seen
[1015.60] anyone having children at this age at this
[1017.68] age people get their children married if
[1021.56] you say even one more word then no
[1024.76] one will be worse than me
[1029.36] I have committed a crime
[1031.92] your mother and I would give
[1034.40] birth to such ill mannered and ill-mannered daughters
[1037.44] I never thought
[1040.64] I didn't where was the deficiency
[1044.96] in my upbringing it was probably because of us
[1049.12] your deficiency was there
[1050.80] In life, you have behaved rudely at this age, Abhir,
[1061.08] come on, don't create a scene in the room,
[1065.08] come on, it has already created a scene, when people will
[1067.96] laugh at us, you will silence
[1070.12] them and that Atul
[1072.60] aunty, she wants a chance to talk about us, Abhir, stop it, it's a
[1077.40] matter of three-four months,
[1081.64] this image will be ruined, it will
[1084.80] feel so good here, come, congratulations, my
[1089.32] mother is about to deliver,
[1092.84] for God's sake, shut up now, don't do this,
[1097.84] you people, I will
[1101.88] eat something and die after hearing all this
[1114.74] [Music]
[1120.38] [Laughter]
[1121.82] [Music]
[1133.29] [Laughter]
[1133.35] [Music]
[1140.08] Aaram, till when will you keep spoiling the atmosphere of my house because of that girl, last
[1145.40] night you did it in front of the brother, he did
[1148.16] n't give you money, what would he be thinking,
[1150.24] and it doesn't matter to me what he would be thinking, it should matter,
[1151.84] Aaram, it's a question of my sister's
[1155.28] respect and happiness, so
[1158.80] how many people in this house are concerned about my happiness
[1163.12] and as far as respect is concerned,
[1165.84] mama you don't see anyone else's respect in front of you,
[1168.64] whatever you
[1171.60] said at Momna's house  He didn't even give you pocket money.
[1174.64] So Momna
[1178.32] complained to my son about his mother.
[1182.16] Stupid boys like you are the ones who
[1184.48] make the lives of middle class girls like these.
[1186.16] Otherwise such girls
[1188.28] stay at home all their lives. The
[1190.16] whole family is fooling you
[1193.48] Arham and you are becoming a fool.
[1196.64] That Abrar Hasan doesn't even have the manners to talk.
[1199.00] And I should establish a relationship with them, that
[1201.92] too of my only son.
[1204.72] Fine,
[1207.32] you can do whatever your heart desires,
[1210.32] but I will
[1212.80] not be a part of any of your requested programs. In fact,
[1215.76] I will close this topic of marriage. I do
[1218.20] n't want to get married.
[1220.88] I am going to Canada after my exams.
[1222.48] I don't want to stay here.
[1230.77] [Sangeet]
[1247.00] Amma's health is not well at all.
[1248.90] [Sangeet] It is
[1254.36] not right to take tension about her in this condition.
[1258.84] You were telling her as if it was
[1260.60] all her fault. Does
[1262.40] any woman knowingly become a mother?
[1265.52] Why didn't she know about her mistake? You
[1268.40] should have gone to a good doctor
[1270.15] [Sangeet] She died, there is
[1275.56] no benefit in dying.
[1279.74] [Sangeet]
[1285.44] She is the son's  She is going to be a mother
[1288.86] [sangeet]
[1293.16] and this is the biggest happiness of Baba's life, whether it is a
[1295.52] son or a daughter, at this age
[1299.28] our parents were fond of being made fun of
[1301.84] and you see, Aapi that
[1304.40] Amtula aunty who is firm on your principles, when she comes to know,
[1306.68] then listen and bear your
[1311.24] insult, Arham bhai is also trying in vain to
[1313.88] convince them, it is
[1315.76] not in our fate, friend, a
[1318.24] good home and a good family, please Abir, now keep
[1320.64] quiet,
[1322.36] whatever is in my fate will happen, do
[1327.36] n't burn your heart and I am not burning mine by talking like this, Aapi I am
[1332.44] talking sensibly
[1334.66] [sangeet]
[1337.00] before the world comes to know
[1339.84] what is going on in our house, you get married
[1342.96] and go
[1344.72] from here, this is better for you
[1351.79] [sangeet]
[1355.40] later the son will come,
[1358.92] who will ask about us in this house
[1360.99] [sangeet]
[1365.00] f mamma why are you saying the same thing to me again and again,
[1368.00] if Momina is important for me, then
[1370.76] your happiness is more important than that,
[1373.56] I don't know how all this will happen,
[1376.00] but whenever it will happen, it will happen with your happiness
[1382.16] Son, marriage is not a companionship of two or four days,
[1386.28] it is a commitment for the whole life See, there aren't
[1390.60] so many differences between them and us, so
[1392.64] believe me I wouldn't have been so adamant We have our own
[1395.24] image They have their own
[1398.24] life style, there is a lot of difference between the two
[1401.68] Aram, believe me one day these
[1404.52] things will irritate you, they will never irritate me
[1410.84] Mama these commitments are also made from the heart,
[1412.64] otherwise the same old
[1414.92] compromise Be reasonable Aram There should be something
[1418.76] that forces me to agree to your point
[1422.16] Mama
[1424.04] Momna
[1427.28] Momina Momina has all those things that I
[1433.32] want in my life partner She is really very good She
[1437.44] can easily carry on our lifestyle
[1439.40] And then no marriage is perfect
[1442.46] [Sangeet]
[1443.64] Sometimes the classes do not match, sometimes the
[1447.44] thoughts and happiness is achieved by meeting the thoughts This is the
[1452.84] question of my happiness
[1455.55] [Sangeet]
[1463.44] Wait I am
[1466.48] I For your happiness it is
[1471.24] so difficult for me to even think of going to Abrar Hasan's house Anyways
[1474.88] you have definitely liked Momna
[1478.36] Ram, but she will have to live her life in my way Please
[1481.36] explain to her why she didn't
[1483.96] live her life according to you
[1487.12] Gujri thank you very much ya I l
[1491.91] [Music]
[1516.92] Look Bhabhi we have
[1519.60] not come to repeat the past we have
[1522.88] come to revive the happiness which is connected with the lives of our children so it's
[1530.60] okay Bhaisahab but how can all this happen so
[1533.16] soon
[1535.56] look the children have already decided that
[1538.60] if we don't listen to them then they
[1541.80] can take any step
[1543.68] well leave these things these things will keep happening if
[1547.64] I am not feeling right then it's okay get
[1554.52] yourself tested you got all the tests done by your doctor everything is fine how can
[1561.52] someone call sugar blood pressure a
[1565.24] disease without doing anything it can happen to anyone
[1567.32] nowadays well now if you just sit idle nothing happens
[1571.68] this is a disease that is found in the body
[1575.24] definitely someone else in your family will have it
[1577.88] first
[1579.68] look I had told you not to listen to what I said
[1584.60] if we keep giving up our self like this then the
[1588.24] happiness of our children will die
[1592.52] or I just have one request to you that now it's
[1595.44] okay to tell you the old things
[1599.04] but what is the need to go through all this formality
[1601.72] or right now just  If we had talked, that would have been fine.
[1605.44] Where is the formality or
[1609.16] what is right and wrong Abrar. I do
[1613.24] n't want to get into this judgment. I just want
[1616.04] that there should be no shortage of any kind in my son's wedding.
[1618.32] That's why today we will go after fixing the date
[1621.72] and also deciding the menu and the venue.
[1627.54] [Sangeet]
[1629.56] Brother, I believe that every good work should start with something
[1632.64] sweet.
[1635.16] Here, Bhabhi, sweeten your mouth.
[1640.28] Please,
[1643.40] just sweeten your mouth. After that, we will
[1646.08] drink tea made by you.
[1649.44] Here, brother, you also
[1651.32] eat.
[1654.56] [Sangeet]
[1669.76] Thank you. Do you know what is the best part of our friendship?
[1676.00] We understand each other's words without even saying them. We do
[1681.20] n't make fun of each other's compulsions.
[1685.36] If that were the case, the hope of staying together would have
[1688.36] vanished long ago. To
[1690.56] stay together, support is necessary.
[1694.68] You have accepted defeat already. I do
[1697.84] n't want to lose by winning
[1699.49] [Sangeet] We
[1702.28] can ignore aunty's thinking,
[1709.40] not her decision. You should agree with her. I have
[1713.20] accepted her words.
[1714.56] Momina, I don't have any other option.
[1716.78] [Sangeet]
[1720.68] But I will miss this friend of mine a lot, who makes
[1723.52] me positive.  She asks me to stay
[1726.28] and it is written in big letters on her face that
[1728.64] Ram, I have no complaints about life without you, so I will get
[1735.36] used to living without you anyway,
[1739.72] life gives a new excuse at every turn to
[1744.04] stay alive, so how would
[1746.52] you feel living without me? No, I have
[1753.16] n't thought about it yet, when will I
[1764.84] think about it after your marriage?
[1768.81] [Music]
[1787.12] Thank you, won't you ask me to have tea for the last time?
[1791.04] Obviously, from tomorrow I will be busy with my wedding
[1793.60] preparations. The
[1796.44] van will come to pick and drop you too

[1916.16] Job
[1921.62] [Music] There has been a
[1934.96] joke between you and Arham till now,
[1937.68] but now your relationship is changing
[1941.52] and I really like the joke of relationships.
[1944.72] No,
[1946.08] now you are going to become the daughter-in-law of our house, let
[1950.72] me tell you one thing,
[1953.76] I would never want that in
[1956.80] front of me anyone should let down my son's wife
[1960.88] or taunt her for being middle class and sub-standard
[1964.75] [Music]
[1969.12] Bhabhi, if there has been any negligence in my upbringing,
[1973.12] please forgive it,
[1977.92] I have never let my daughters
[1979.88] feel the hot air of the situation
[1982.00] and in future too I will leave these people to their fate
[1989.65] [Music]

[2017.36] Saj I got impressed by Arham Bhai, I did
[2020.80] not know that he is so romantic,
[2024.52] you should watch these films less and we do
[2030.44] not need to be too impressed by Lanti, did not see the whole lecture of
[2033.76] his, hey, it is just the beginning, when
[2037.64] this story will be known, then the sky will be raised on our heads,
[2041.40] you should tell Arham Bhai, he did not tell
[2044.92] him, he was yours, then what do I
[2051.12] tell, I do not have the courage, you are practical friend,
[2055.76] anyway, do Arne Prove  Diya na, now you should
[2059.40] also support them.
[2062.40] Bring some food, I have to cook. What
[2069.08] nonsense is this?
[2072.64] Hello, you made up your mind, but you are busy with your sister. Be
[2076.00] kind and call me after some time.
[2082.08] You have a very long life, oh brother. By the way, tell me one thing, your comfort and peace, everything remains
[2086.04] in our house.
[2087.88] How do you feel about this achievement of yours? What should I tell
[2091.16] you? Sometimes it feels to me as if
[2093.84] half of my life will be spent in making Mama happy and the other half in making her happy. I
[2097.16] feel something like this.
[2100.24] Just choice yours, Bhaijaan, now
[2103.84] tell me where are you throwing the party? Let's go for an
[2105.40] ice cream. I am
[2107.52] coming towards you in a while. You guys are
[2112.52] ready. ok done. get ready, why

[2128.48] [Sangeet]
[2138.92] what has happened now,
[2142.04] now everything is out,
[2146.80] okay, I agree that the
[2149.92] intrust that was there between you and me earlier, does
[2152.84] n't let us be happy
[2153.80] [Sangeet]
[2155.08] but you are still not happy.
[2158.52] What
[2161.08] 's the matter, it is clearly visible from your eyes.
[2164.48] Last night also, you were avoiding me
[2167.12] deliberately, weren't you?  What you see and what you
[2171.08] hear is not always the truth,
[2173.88] then what's the
[2176.96] issue Hey yaar I'm really sorry, your
[2180.80] mother, is there any problem?
[2183.12] Seriously, you people also keep
[2186.04] taking her to the hospitals in the neighborhood, let me do
[2187.88] one thing, tomorrow I will take her
[2190.20] to some specialist, get her
[2191.52] tests done, whatever the problem is, it will come out,
[2193.84] listen, I am
[2197.24] not doing any favor, it is
[2198.44] her right on me, when you
[2203.76] say you, then what should I tell you,
[2206.92] what I feel, I am
[2210.12] trying, can we
[2212.80] fully live up to the style of la aunty, that conversation between you and
[2215.64] mum,
[2218.12] I want the same Momina
[2220.24] whom I know,
[2225.48] share one thing
[2229.02] [Sangeet]
[2232.80] Sajana, the same thing which you have not shared till date, which is
[2239.16] perhaps more important than that,
[2242.80] what's the
[2243.96] matter, why are you asking me riddles, tell me
[2246.92] what's the matter,
[2249.20] hey

[2257.24] mother is pregnant
