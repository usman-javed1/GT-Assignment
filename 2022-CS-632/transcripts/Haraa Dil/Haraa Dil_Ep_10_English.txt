Thank you Ada, I will take care of this. I thank you, you people have just arrived. Please carry on, I will drop Mora home. And thank you very much, you thought so much about Sami. No one thinks these days. Thank you, hey son, what is the point of thanks. Just help Ira sahab a little. Don't you think, he is a motherless child, if we take care of him, then Allah will definitely reward us. Anyway, I feel very attached to children. I have been telling Avra ​​sahab for a long time, brother, please give it to me. I will raise it, I will take care of it. Anyway, I am on night duty, I am busy the whole day. It is good, I will be able to focus on the child. And anyway, look son, you people trusted him once and saw him. Now I do n't think that we should take any risk. No, Sami is now in safe hands. Whatever happened to him due to our negligence, it will not happen again. Well, Inshallah, it will be exactly the same. Arar sahab, your daughter turned out to be very intelligent. You did not do anything unnecessarily because of this.  They remain upset, just look how the sun and moon are a pair, let's not waste time now, let's get them married quickly, I think we should leave now, it will be late, yes, we should definitely go, ok daughter, thank you Momina, I think you have forgotten to speak or the conversation between us has ended, we both have been sitting silent for so long, this is not strange, I was just thinking something, what are you thinking, life is so unpredictable, no, what we think and what happens, who will be with us and who will not, no one tells us anything, but still we plan so many things, I was enjoying the talks of your fam aunty, they are a pair of moon and the sun, both look so good together, may Allah accept their prayers soon, ram, please, I am not happy, your mumma has ended our relationship, look, it's my life and my relationship too, if I don't want to end it, then nobody can end it, but what the parents say is everything, of course, but if mumma loves her Ana, then look at me, I am meeting you after so many days, I am meeting you  I only want to see you happy. I have so much lack of confidence in my life that I ca n't be happy anymore. Momna, I agree that there is a lot in our lives, but you should believe me. I cannot separate you from my life. Despite trying, you still want me to believe you. I can trust you. Ram, why do you want me to keep getting humiliated in front of aunty again and again. I know my respect is more important than this trust. But you should also remember one thing. You are not my stubbornness. [Sangeet ] You are my respect. [Sangeet] Hora sahab, I don't like foolish men at all. And you shouldn't have put this bell in your street. When you didn't even have the courage to ring it, what are you saying? Do n't call my desire my cowardice. [Sangeet] I wanted Sami to go into safe hands and along with that, I also want that your status and respect remain in my house. Your child has gone into safe hands. Your daughter has done such a good job. I don't think you need this marriage. End it.  Let's see when and where someone is needed, no one can tell this, you eat food, Inshallah Allah will do good, Allah does good only, the flaw lies in the intentions of a person, it would have been good if you got married after consulting your daughters, this marriage may be a compulsion for you, but you should believe me, there was no flaw in my intentions, I want to spend my life with you and your children with very good intentions and my Allah knows this, it will happen, our intentions are clear, Allah will do better, I had put all my happiness, my emotions to sleep, then when you came in my life, I felt that this is how the path would have been, husband, children, Sami is a piece of my heart, he is very dear to me, I want Bara Sahab to serve you a lot, take care of your house, raise your children like a mother and all this is my legitimate wish, I think it is your responsibility to fulfill all these things, Bhaki, let's eat food, it became cold, it was a lot of fun, we have nothing else, Mau is enough for you, Baba, is it with that nurse  Were you doing shopping or Allah Baba will also be friends with such people can't believe it yes remember one thing of mine when we leave the doors of our house open then anyone can come in Sami is Baba's life and anyone can take advantage of this and make a place in Baba's heart and in this house too yes they can do anything for him but what has happened to you why have you become his nanny for Allah's sake you should use your brain [Music] today I tolerated this because of brother otherwise I am not interested in this [Music] Aapi Arham Bhai is trying to bridge the distance [Music] support him and what will happen if I support him or if you say so and we have to do only what Atul aunty will say he has said this to you do n't look please don't make any plans with him now let him move ahead in his life he wants to move ahead taking you along in his life Aapi understand this thing anal mya anal anal anal now his eyes meet ammi's na did he miss me [Music] in Shagufta Marhama's life when he  People were ready for marriage, so what is the obstacle now? And by the way, your friends are very good people, you should talk to them, sometimes a father has to bow his head in the matter of a daughter, and there is nothing wrong in it. If there is a proper relationship between the two families, how can it break because of someone's saying? I am afraid of Atul Bhabhi's thinking and attitude. Afan has supported me in every difficult time. This relationship was also fixed on his wish. I don't understand what enmity Atul Bhabhi has with me. She would find some reason or the other to reprimand me. But when the boy and the girl agree, what can they do? By the way, I like Aram very much. He is absolutely fit for our Momna. And what better do you want than a boy who even angers his mother for his would-be wife? Angering your mother is also not a proper thing. Okay, Momna's judge should have his place for religion, but see, these relationships should be done with the consent of the two families, only then they would be successful. But see, Araj sahab's family was agreeable, only then it worked.  It was fixed, right? So what's the issue now? Just let's get married and see. By the way, I'm afraid that both of them are very young. If they get carried away and do something wrong, then the blame will not fall on the children but on the parents. Let's see how young the age is. And I like it very much. It's very good for our mother. It's very cute too. You should talk to me soon. You've become very handsome, sir. But you can't get away with it. I'm very angry. Why won't you be with me in such a long time? No phone call. No reply to any of my messages. And look at me, I remember one thing about you. I don't know if you're in my destiny or not. [Music] If you're very close to my heart. Hey, beware. If you show up like this, do you have the courage? Come out of the picture [Music] Hi, handsome [Music] Why didn't you come to pick me up, friend? When a friend comes after such a long time, then a little protocol is a must. And if a stranger enters your room without permission, then what should you do with him? Hold his hand and take him out of the room.  I want right Arham, you take me out of your room, I will kill you with a bang Hey, you guys are behaving as if we meet everyday Arham, see how lovely and elegant the atmosphere has become [Sangeet] Thanks for the complete aunty, actually I was expecting this complete thing from us, but okay, you know that in terms of expressing, this did not go anywhere with you and you know aunty that I believe in expressing openly [Sangeet] [Sangeet] [Sangeet] [Sangeet] Abrar sahab, get up, you slept late last night, you will get late for office Hey, if you just disconnect the phone, one should not marry married people, it is only harmful, their desires are already dead, so Famida Begum hello hello, how are you Famida Begum hey, you called me early in the morning, are you fine, wow, what can I say to you, first you hung up the phone in my face and now you are asking why did I call you, but I did not disconnect your call, rather I picked up my phone immediately  I have just opened my eyes on your phone, why are you getting angry without any reason, yes brother, why would anyone believe me now? I thought I slept late last night, I might get late for office, I am just fulfilling my duty as a wife, and let me also tell you that I am not fully aware of my responsibilities, let's get up, get ready, we are getting late for office, where has Sami gone [Music]? Oh my God, Famida Begum is right, it means Momna heard this call, Fata Begum is a very stupid woman anyway [Music], I do n't know what Momna will think about us, what should we do, Baba, can't you see this, what has happened, he is crying, he is not quiet at all, Samimi, what happened, son, it's a bad thing, son, don't bother your sister, it's such a bad thing, no, don't bother her, you are a good child, I will do one thing, I will call Famida, if she has time, she will come and check it, but she is just a nurse, not a doctor, but son, that nurse is for children, you let it be, I will do one thing, my friend's Ami  He is a child specialist. Anyway I had to go to meet him. I will go there and take Sami along too. Okay. And I will get some practice as well. I will get to know what is needed and what is not. Okay, son. As you wish, you get ready, I will drop you. No, Baba, you eat your breakfast comfortably and go to the office. Give him to me. I will stay with Sami and take care of him. You know, I am also looking for tips on G that how to be a good mother to children. Mamna, Mamna, son, don't make him addicted to me. I will get you married too. Baba, Sami will now stay with me. Now the one who wants to marry me should think. [Music ] Take my child, let me put him to sleep. You have your breakfast. He will cool down. [Music] You have confused me. This is a strange coward. Your brother acts giggly in front of his daughters. Not a word comes out of his mouth. That man is not a coward, he is a wise man. The poor guy got trapped after getting married. Oh, to hell with all this, what was the use of being wise?  Brother, repent, they have kept me sitting at home, they are not taking me home at all, it's good that I didn't leave my job in the hospital, otherwise you know how I would have been, by the way, what do they call it, yes, the washerman's dog, neither of the house nor of the pot, disappointment is not such a good thing, now you see, after marriage, how much glow has come on your face, this is when the companionship of a man becomes complete, oh, what kind of companionship is it, a wife, by force, I took them out for dinner, that too on the pretext of shopping for the child and what happened there, do you know, their daughter and future son in law dropped in, it is a matter of great happiness that you met your future son in law, he is a very nice boy, despite all this, see, he did not leave Momna's side, his mother does not want the marriage to happen, but the father and son are adamant on the issue, brother, this means that I will have to treat their mother also, otherwise I would keep hanging like this all my life, not knowing when your brother will think of me and when he will take me to his home, Nayla, when did you come, Assalam  Walekum mummy Walekum Assalam you wash your face and hands I will put some rotis for you put two rotis for me too how are you I am fine how are you I am fine how is your college going your college is very great that Abir is also in your college right yes yes come sit tell me how is the college going come come ok so which year are you in second year ok so still in your class yes [Music] by the way mummy what was the need for you to get Abrar uncle and Fahmi aunty married did n't you see their issues come to me everyday now should I take care of someone else's child or should I look after the household chores and how much responsibility a small child has what if something goes wrong with Kala then what will I do I did n't you see how Kausar took her away mummy that's why I am saying that if tomorrow Momna aapi and Abir come to know then this good deed will be on your shoulders Assalam Walekum Walekum Assalam son how are you I am fine that's when the door of your house was open so I thought of coming myself oh  I also went there and forgot to lock the door Nala you did n't lock the door son now well I was going to my friend keep the keys if Baba is there give it to him if it gets late he wo n't get worried you are taking Sami with you yes now Sami will go with me everywhere my younger brother he is there let's go Khuda Hafiz Khuda Hafiz I love Khuda [Music] Hafiz first of all you don't take me to your house and on top of that you have taken all the food and water of my house on yourself this doesn't seem appropriate but thank God I have a job I am managing at home see what I find appropriate right now I am trying to do that I have married you I have the responsibility of your non-wife you are not doing me a favour I am fine you seem a bit worried Sami is fine by the way I keep asking Zeba about Sami's well being I am his real mother otherwise I feel that I don't even have that much right on him right now you talk very nicely hey sometimes  I laugh remembering your words. It is my good fortune that you remembered me. Tell me what is the matter. What are you hiding from me. The wish that everything would be fine in life is getting fulfilled. Momna is becoming very dear to me. Now even when I pick her up in my lap, she becomes restless. But you do not have the courage to talk to your children about us. Tell her, how long will this continue? Now the people in the neighbourhood have started talking. They are right in saying that when I am married, I should stay in my husband's house. And then he sees you coming and going in this house everyday. It does not feel good. Now tell me, when will we talk? [Sangeet] I will try to talk to Momna today. She is my very sensible daughter. Yes, if she shows understanding in your matter, then please forgive me. Your daughters are very happy. They should have got you married themselves. Has anyone ever thought that what will happen to you when both of them will become of their own homes? No one thinks about you. You are not worried.
