[497.72] made plans for a movie  Look, no excuse will be
[500.04] accepted. I don't have any friends
[502.12] here. All my holidays will go waste,
[504.60] yaar. I swear. If I had
[508.36] even the slightest idea that you are so busy, I would
[510.40] never have come. Fiza, please, I will
[513.12] not go to watch the movie, yaar. I am very tired. I have
[514.56] spent the whole day very busy today.
[517.56] I will not be able to go. You work
[519.84] with Mumma or go with Aariz. In fact, Aariz is
[521.92] very fond of watching movies. Have fun.
[528.44] Listen to me. Are you
[534.72] serious? Okay, I will go
[538.20] alone.
[540.72] But Mumma, I have never misbehaved with Fiza.
[542.96] I did not want to go to watch the movie.
[545.08] I said I will not go.
[553.58] [Music] That's
[560.44] right.
[564.28] You should have gone with her. You will have to
[566.84] change your routine. Fiza
[569.80] wants to spend time with you. She has
[572.40] come after so many days. You guys will have to give
[575.08] some time to understand and know each other.
[578.00] But Mumma, do I
[580.08] need to understand and know more than this? Do
[582.92] I have to spend my whole life with her?
[584.48] Oh, wow, you have chosen your heart.  I have
[588.00] told you about it, now if you spend time together and
[592.00] get to know each other, then it is possible that you will
[594.92] also
[598.12] enjoy spending life together Aunty, decisions of living life are made
[601.64] with the mind,
[606.12] not the heart, why Mr.
[609.16] Arm, oh wow, you turned out to be more intelligent than I thought, let's have
[612.60] dinner on this matter
[616.20] and he will also go out somewhere on my behalf, in
[619.84] fact we will go where Fiza will say,
[624.24] I will call Raj and Jawar as well, I would be grateful if you tell me, actually
[632.12] I had
[636.56] some work, Mama, I did not have any work left, I
[640.20] just told him, now we can at least do this much for Fiza
[648.91] [Music]
[653.76] Nas, thank you
[657.48] Aunty, I will just
[680.84] take the tea, you sit down without insisting like a child,
[683.88] what was the need to come here, oh
[687.12] why, there was no need to come, you have
[689.60] fulfilled all your desires with your first wife, it is my
[691.44] first marriage, I only have these
[694.24] small desires that I have a candle light dinner with my husband, let's go
[701.51] [Music]
[703.99] [Prashant]
[704.87] [Music]
[713.22] [Prashant] Let's
[717.96] go
[724.22] [Music] it's
[744.32] too late
[747.88] Baba has not come home yet.
[753.60] Hey, he never used to be so late.
[758.40] Now their routine has got spoiled. You have
[762.68] taken the responsibility of their child.
[765.08] They were not worried about us earlier. Now they have become
[768.96] careless about Sami as well. I am
[774.00] telling you, everything happened because of you
[777.84] and because of Sami. No, no, your
[781.56] marriage will take place. What all marriages?
[785.44] Why is there only a concern about marriage in this world? Is
[787.68] everything just about marriage? Whoever you see,
[790.08] marriage, marriage, did Baba go there and marry Fata Begum? Why are you
[796.28] looking at it like this?
[800.48] Our Baba has married that nurse. We have a
[810.32] candlelight dinner with her husband.
[816.04] I am thinking that we should leave from here.
[819.88] Why, what happened? Why should we leave from here?
[824.12] You must be thinking that the bill will be high. Do
[826.72] n't worry at all. If the bill comes high,
[829.64] I will pay it. Anyway, our money and yours are
[833.12] not separate, right?
[836.00] From where will this money come? You order in the meantime.
[849.36] [Music]
[856.96] [Music]
[867.68] Better
[869.76] [Music]
[926.48] With the same woman whose name you cannot even bear to take.
[930.16] This relationship is so meaningless, isn't it?
[937.36] Hollow If there is anyone who is the most dishonest in this world,
[939.84] then it is the husband
[942.92] 's wife, the promises he made to her, the oaths he took to her, they
[949.72] bury everything in her grave and give it to some other woman in her place
[952.92] very comfortably They don't give
[955.28] them any gifts, sister, I ca
[963.08] n't believe it sister, the
[967.88] nikahnama of the baba is kept on the table over there, go and
[973.72] see it
[977.09] [Music]
[987.52] Take it
[988.98] [Music]
[1031.28] I did
[1034.92] not eat, it's good that I accepted your advice, the
[1037.64] food is really very tasty, what do you
[1043.20] call it, I have
[1047.40] never eaten outside, I don't know
[1055.58] [Music] I was
[1060.80] coming from the ladies room, okay [Music]
[1071.44] oh you're late
[1073.07] [Music] I'm
[1077.40] gone,
[1084.76] hey, what happened to your hand,
[1090.12] maybe a nail was protruding from the door and got stuck,
[1094.28] people make standards
[1096.64] but there is nothing like maintenance, I'll complain, I'll go and
[1102.80] put a bandage on you, no no, I'm a little
[1105.68] health conscious, I'm a doctor only, no no,
[1109.04] you don't know, I
[1111.60] 'm a qualified nurse, there's nothing unhygienic in
[1113.96] my  The doctor nearby will also
[1115.88] apply this only, anyway my husband
[1119.28] tells me that you keep on moving around I have
[1121.76] all the things with me, who knows who will
[1124.08] need what at what time, I should
[1127.44] keep this with me, it's a
[1131.88] deep cut, if I don't apply this at
[1136.16] this time, your whole clothes will get torn,
[1138.92] thank you, you're
[1141.88] welcome, by the way the doctor also does bandage, it's
[1144.92] good that you are here
[1147.12] [Sangeet],
[1163.84] where did you apply it for so long, your food had gone
[1166.60] cold, hey, I had already eaten my food, you
[1168.96] know, I found a lady in the bathroom,
[1171.24] her cut hand was bleeding so profusely that I got
[1174.20] worried, I quickly took it
[1176.28] out and applied the bandage, she is sitting in
[1178.96] front of me, I should
[1181.44] apply the bandage on her, it may happen
[1184.56] that her clothes get covered in blood
[1186.72] [Sangeet]
[1201.25] [Sangeet]
[1213.56] I think we should go, why should we
[1216.16] go, right now you will give me some
[1218.44] nice coffee and listen, the coffee here is very
[1220.04] good, order it, then you
[1222.56] order coffee, I will wait for you in the car,
[1225.32] well then I'll also go,
[1228.72] where should we stop
[1236.46] [Sangeet]
[1247.44] so anyway, my  My husband is there, he
[1250.96] tells me that you should go then
[1254.04] [sangeet]
[1287.04] come to pick me up [sangeet
[1303.47] ] [
[1328.41] sangeet]
[1342.24] [sangeet]
[1349.12] [sangeet]
[1369.50] [sangeet]
[1404.63] [sangeet]
[1410.76] I have taken this
[1412.32] decision by forcing myself,
[1418.76] if maybe that day
[1421.28] and all that had not happened with Sami
[1426.43] [sangeet]
[1428.08] then it would have been a crime for me to even think like this, I should
[1435.32] die at the hands of the well-wishers,
[1440.36] I thought about her and it was very good that
[1442.76] you thought something for Sami,
[1445.96] sometimes happiness is found even in forced decisions,
[1453.04] now you do one thing,
[1455.48] bring that woman to this house,
[1460.88] you will stay out of the house at night and we will
[1463.92] spend our nights in fear,
[1466.80] you
[1468.28] [sangeet] have gone
[1469.96] mad, that
[1472.04] woman whose face I cannot tolerate will
[1474.76] come to our house
[1476.90] [sangeet] and will
[1479.44] stay in Amma's house, in Amma's room, if
[1484.76] you people talk to me like this again,
[1487.40] I will not forgive you people,
[1491.48] you have taken the contract of giving us pain,
[1495.12] one's tolerance should not be this high,
[1500.04] Baba, this attitude of both of you has forced me to do all this,
[1506.00] if you people can take care of brother  If you had taken my turn, then
[1509.56] what was the need for me to get married at this old age
[1511.84] You didn't even need a child
[1515.72] Baba This child took away our mother
[1519.04] Aapi's engagement got broken
[1521.28] And God knows what all we will have to hear
[1524.64] People will only say that your
[1527.76] father was fond of hobbies, he does
[1530.92] n't see compulsions, he
[1535.28] only sees drama Stop appealing All this has happened because of you
[1538.44] You are responsible for this Especially
[1541.64] you are your brother He is yours If
[1545.64] both of you had taken responsibility of him on the first day then
[1548.00] what was the need for me to create this drama I didn't want a brother
[1552.56] Even without this brother there was no lack in our life
[1558.88] Yes you wanted a son And now you got that son's
[1564.00] mother so easily You got
[1567.36] everything and everything of ours was lost so easily Stop it
[1574.80] Abir what was to happen has happened Go to your room
[1582.04] Our respect is in our silence
[1585.72] Where has the respect you are talking about remained
[1589.28] [Music]
[1590.92] If that woman comes into this house then I will make her
[1595.76] life hell No
[1597.48] one can take my mother's place Are you
[1601.24] listening Baba don't tell me Baba
[1604.92] your
[1605.76] Baba is dead Pray that where your mother is  She has gone
[1608.60] there, right? I should also go there
[1611.36] [Sangeet] Should I
[1616.60] go
[1619.83] [Sangeet]
[1643.08] Good
[1646.52] morning everyone Good morning Have you not come
[1650.40] at the wrong time?
[1652.36] Something has happened? Everyone is like this. Oh no, not
[1657.28] at all. Son, you are family.
[1659.36] Everything can be discussed in front of you.
[1665.08] Aaram ji, I had to talk to you about something important. Are you
[1669.84] in a hurry? No, you did not say anything.
[1674.72] Your dad's friend and you,
[1677.80] Abrar uncle has married for the second
[1701.88] time. [Sangeet] And I have heard that his wife is a nurse in some third class hospital. This can never happen. If something like this had happened, Abrar would have definitely told me. I meet Momna every day. Aaram also, she did not tell you this.
[1711.66] [Sangeet] I am also missing you a lot. [
[1717.72] Sangeet]
[1719.40] I am not able to understand a lot. [Sangeet] I cannot understand how someone can be missed so much.
[1723.73] [Sangeet] I
[1726.40] can understand. The
[1730.60] pain of separation from mother does
[1735.08] not go away. In fact,
[1739.40] the older it gets, the
[1742.80] more it hurts.
[1749.04] You
[1752.44] cry to your heart's content, your heart will become lighter. You
[1759.84] know that when mother goes away, the
[1765.16] prayers that even that which gives
[1769.72] us sorrow, is taken away from us.  She would protect him from the cold and heat.
[1774.52] By the way Aram I
[1777.64] wanted to hear this from you
[1779.28] but if you knew then you would have
[1781.88] definitely told me, right?
[1785.80] Anyway this is their personal matter. I was
[1789.16] just trying to confirm whether Abrar has
[1791.56] married that third grade woman
[1795.44] or
[1796.32] not. I
[1798.76] mean this is not really a disgusting situation. There is nothing like
[1804.52] that. You have misunderstood.
[1808.24] If something like that had happened then Abrar would have definitely
[1812.88] told me. And I was in favour of his marriage.
[1815.68] Brother, all his problems will be solved if he gets married. It does
[1819.24] n't
[1821.68] make sense. But if he does it then it is very good. He should have done it. I don't
[1824.48] think it was
[1828.16] good.
[1838.96] Ex. I am in my room.
[1845.96] I will talk to Abraaj today itself.
[1849.16] What happened to him? For God's sake,
[1852.68] leave those people alone. The time to talk and
[1855.52] support them has passed. If you do
[1858.48] this then there will be a change in Aram as well. He will also
[1861.36] come out of the cage of beliefs and will
[1864.04] see this world with the eyes of reality. And this is
[1866.48] very good for Aram. Believe me
[1869.44] that  There is no benefit to me in this.
[1871.60] I only want Aram's happiness. Not this
[1874.60] everyday drama.
[1879.56] What does marriage have to do with Aram's happiness? Bye Dave, where do you keep meeting me? It may
[1882.12] or may not be related to happiness, but I am happy.
[1888.04] And now you will see that there will be no place for Mamna in Arham's life.
[1892.20] I know my son this much.
[1899.83] [Music]
[1904.96] Hi Momina, I just want to hear the truth.
[1908.40] You knew everything, right? Uncle
[1910.84] must have told you why Uncle married that woman for the second time. And
[1913.64] just let
[1917.72] my Baba marry her and you are
[1919.48] putting me in the dock. As soon as I came to know,
[1922.64] I first called you and asked
[1925.72] why Baa married that nurse. I do
[1929.92] n't know, and neither do I want to know. Friend,
[1932.52] Uncle did not do the right thing by marrying that woman.
[1934.48] I only know this.
[1935.96] Okay, we have no right to interfere in somebody else's personal life and
[1938.72] comment.
[1940.68] But still, it is not such that
[1943.04] I should keep you and myself away from this. You
[1946.00] know, what
[1948.72] Baba did will neither
[1951.20] benefit us, nor  Sami,
[1953.60] if anyone will benefit then it will only be this
[1956.80] aunty,
[1960.08] maybe that is why she came to our house, I don't know
[1963.72] what happened to your father, you should have considered your age,
[1966.00] friend, please, if you want to give
[1969.36] me a decision, then do tell me, anyway so much has happened to
[1975.40] me that I am not
[1978.12] scared of anyone's hands or shock now, just wait
[1980.24] a minute, what do you want,
[1983.52] I should happily welcome your new mother
[1985.84] and then go and
[1987.92] explain to my mother, don't explain, don't explain to your mother, if
[1991.24] you want to leave from here or tell me,
[1994.96] tell her, if you want to leave from here, then go away, in fact,
[1997.48] now I also want that
[1999.80] you leave from here and never come back, the
[2002.76] memories of the good days between us are
[2005.48] enough, I do
[2008.64] n't have the courage to bear anything,
[2014.08] well I have not reached the limit of pity, I have the
[2021.40] courage to understand the truth and accept it, I am
[2030.00] distant from what my father did,
[2033.68] but
[2035.96] still I love my father very much,
[2040.12] loving him is natural in me, if someone
[2043.84] insults him or makes fun of him,
[2047.16] I don't like this  You cannot tolerate
[2050.48] all these things, why don't you go and explain all these things to your father,
[2052.08] because it is not so easy to explain to parents,
[2057.40] if it were so easy then
[2060.52] today we would have been together in your house [

[2080.24] you wouldn't have taunted me, don't do this today, don't
[2085.20] do this favor, where there is favor, the feeling ends, please,
