[41.04] Guta you are getting worried as if
[45.28] God has done a big crime,
[47.48] you don't suggest any other thing to you men,
[51.28] I am worried thinking
[54.88] what will happen if Momna and I come to know
[57.40] and Momna don't know from where she got involved in this
[61.00] NBA otherwise
[63.60] preparations for her delivery would have been going on at this time, you
[65.80] forgot last year Asiya Bhabhi had insisted so much for
[68.08] her marriage, come on baba, what has happened has happened,
[74.04] what is the use of not digging into the past, I say let's
[76.76] tell Momna and Abir,
[81.68] how long can we hide such a big truth,
[86.68] you have decided that in my
[89.32] entire life I will never be
[91.68] able to talk to my daughters with my head raised, hey, just think for a while
[95.12] and anyway, children of this age, you forgot
[98.00] what the doctor had said, at least
[100.20] realize this, you doctors have
[102.84] no idea about this, now what you and
[105.40] your doctor are thinking  It can also be wrong
[107.28] Tomorrow morning you will take me to some good
[110.32] singing college I don't
[112.68] want this child
[115.08] I will make arrangements for myself before the time runs out
[118.84] Please
[120.76] Shata you are talking as if you have to make
[123.88] arrangements to throw out some garbage
[127.28] I feel sorry for your thinking
[130.52] and I feel sorry for you You are
[134.12] so worried about the one who has not come into this world
[136.36] and you are not equally worried about me and my daughters
[140.38] [Music] I am just making
[147.24] you realize
[150.19] [Music]
[152.76] I don't want
[154.44] this
[157.28] mistake of yours to become a sorrow for the rest of your life
[163.20] You are important to me
[165.89] [Music]
[166.76] [Praise]
[176.59] [Music] Here,
[181.44] take this hot
[183.88] yakhni I made myself Don't
[189.40] make faces Now if you drink it quickly you will get
[192.24] well quickly
[192.88] [Music]
[217.44] Why will you go Are you giving me a headache by walking so much
[219.32] Aapi what's the matter There is no
[224.08] issue with me I am getting worried
[227.92] because Amma's sugar
[229.36] level is getting very high How come Amma does
[232.64] n't even touch sweets yaar Aapi sugar is
[236.40] not caused by sweets but by tension and yours
[238.92] Atul aunty, you are stressed because of her words,
[241.24] this is the result of that. You should not
[244.04] connect everything there.
[246.16] Shukr blood pressure, everything has suddenly gone high.
[250.60] I am not able to understand
[252.84] what to
[268.60] do [Music]
[276.08] [Music]
[283.12] Aapi, the solution to your problem will be found from the street
[287.22] [Music]
[314.72] See, I told you that I will
[317.88] not be able to hide this thing for long.
[320.56] As soon as Mamna and I go, please
[321.92] take me to the hospital. Something has to be done today itself
[324.72] before the matter gets out of the house.
[327.60] I told you to talk to your daughters,
[332.48] they are very intelligent. Whatever decision they
[337.64] take, I cannot support you in this matter.
[341.24] Assalam Walekum Walekum
[345.16] Assalam. Today again you got up before I woke up, didn't you? I
[347.76] told you that I will cook the breakfast today,
[351.56] but no, you have to get
[354.60] up before my alarm and cook all the breakfast as well. I have got your
[358.48] sugar tested. How is your health
[362.40] now? I am fine. Nothing has happened to my blood
[365.72] pressure, sugar, everything is fine. And
[368.88] what happened to you, you are not ready. Go and get
[370.56] ready. Don't you want to go?
[372.84] How can I leave you in this condition?
[376.28] I am not going anywhere today.
[379.28] I will do all the housework and you
[381.72] will take rest, Momna. I am not sick. I am fine.
[385.08] And anyway, if I am confined to bed, I become even more
[388.56] sick. At this age, I will keep getting
[392.68] blood pressure and sugar shocks.
[398.21] [Music]
[399.52] No, daughter, why are you staring at me like that?
[403.77] [Music]
[405.08] Nothing has happened. I am absolutely fine. Go
[409.12] and get ready. You are fine.
[412.20] Nothing has happened to
[413.36] me. She is just saying that
[416.16] she is not as sick as you think.
[419.51] [Music]
[421.32] Go, this will happen every day now. And will you go and
[424.80] sit after taking leave every day? [
[426.47] Music] You will go
[437.74] [Music]
[446.08] Well, I told you so easily that it will always feel like this. There is a
[451.20] limit to
[456.40] anger, Shata. You are just overreacting.
[460.60] This is a gift from Allah. What is our fault?
[467.95] [Music]
[485.64] What juice have you brought for me? Do
[488.16] n't you remember which
[489.96] juice I drink today? Why do you always forget? Go and take it.
[495.84] What happened to this, Mama? You are probably
[499.80] mistaking Momna for
[501.64] Mano.  So I should not give him space, do
[506.24] you think I will ignore Arham's
[508.20] foolishness so easily? On
[510.52] the other hand, Anush is waiting for Aram's proposal
[513.68] and you are thinking of going to NC,
[516.32] you had a lot of respect, right? Arham
[519.80] cannot do this, Arham cannot do that,
[522.28] Arham will still do what I want, did you
[525.96] understand?
[527.36] Your words are beyond my understanding. You
[531.40] tell me what to say to Anush, there is
[533.96] no need to say anything right now, you just wait and watch,
[539.96] he will himself refuse this relation, if he does
[542.80] not refuse, his life will be made by easily getting into a relation,
[546.44] what else do
[549.00] they want? Haven't you seen that
[551.88] those people did not have the courage to come to your wedding?
[555.44] Well, Mama, you should arrange tickets for my brother to Scotland,
[558.72] I want to relax for a few days, a
[561.08] boring thing like marriage has
[563.36] tired me, you should talk about this to my brother,
[568.12] for God's sake, Mama, he
[572.12] cannot afford all this, but I can do it, I don't
[574.56] know in which family affair
[577.16] you have trapped me?
[580.32] Hello Afan, when are we going, Abrar  At Hassan's
[583.76] house okay
[584.96] okay
[598.12] bring the juice
[600.04] [Music]
[615.16] [Prasha]
[615.82] [Music] It is
[634.08] so easy for you to ignore me
[636.48] because you know you are my
[638.80] weakness I will neither get angry with you nor
[641.52] can I go away from you that is why
[644.88] you are ruining your and my happiness over such a small matter this is not a
[647.72] small matter
[650.32] you know very well that Areej and
[653.20] Atul aunty did all that on purpose
[655.68] and the reason behind that is you I know you should
[659.44] value my words you
[661.84] only care about your words
[664.52] I have seen my caste being reduced to nothing in your house
[670.76] you do
[673.72] n't care about that in spite of all this if I
[677.36] live in a happy state then I have gone mad
[679.84] all your grievances will go away
[681.56] one day trust me I don't know when that day will
[687.96] come I mean I have no complaint against you no
[691.80] complaint
[693.84] you don't need to fight with your mother for me let
[699.04] whatever is happening happen
[702.20] I won't get anything more than my fate
[704.92] okay okay then I will marry Anush
[709.72] what do you mean what do I mean this was
[713.68] not what I meant the whole thing  You don't listen and start talking
[717.96] If Allah has written my fate to be
[721.28] with you Joke I know that it is written
[724.73] [Music]
[726.48] Then I am not going to part ways with you so soon I should have
[734.12] understood, you
[737.72] have the right to be angry with you That's
[740.76] why I am angry
[743.44] [Music]
[747.88] Saj
[753.93] [Music]
[757.76] Look Shagufta I am not saying that you have done
[760.04] anything wrong You can understand this much
[763.04] This is the most delicate phase of life And then this
[768.68] pregnancy Now you are probably
[771.36] not in a position to remove it
[774.60] But Doctor sahab we don't even want this
[779.92] Yes there is risk in both cases There can be
[783.40] harm to the child as well as the mother
[785.36] Okay you come tomorrow Then we will see
[789.72] how the growth of the baby is Then we will continue
[791.92] Okay
[794.84] thank you very much
[796.91] [Music] Thank you Okay Okay let's go Okay Okay Khuda
[823.84] Hafiz Oh
[827.84] Allah brother congratulations to you Tomorrow Phan and
[832.44] Amtul Bhabhi are coming to our house You wanted to take Momna's
[835.84] proposal,
[837.76] right You should be happy Really you are
[843.32] saying the truth Amtul Bhabhi is coming to our house
[846.44] But on that day she was not in the mood  We were meeting
[849.16] suddenly what
[851.16] happened, think
[853.00] that if Atul Bhabhi's thinking can change
[857.44] then anything can happen,
[860.48] now you don't know how everything
[864.08] happened, when did it happen, look Atul Bhabhi is
[866.96] coming to our house for the first time, there
[869.52] should be no lack of any kind of attention, so
[872.56] you take me with you to the market, I will
[874.68] see myself what to buy
[876.00] for her, you are doing wonders, wife,
[879.40] sit comfortably, now you should take care of
[881.76] yourself, sit comfortably, here you are going to become a mother,
[884.84] brother, you do this, get me a list made, I will
[888.88] go once and bring everything,
[890.88] what is the need for you to go, brother tell
[893.92] me, brother take
[897.00] wife, oh,
[900.24] now tell me what to bring, the list will be made right now, what is
[903.40] this,
[908.48] tell me one thing, you did not mention anything to Afan Bhai,
[914.92] wife, is she talking about children, it
[918.32] means he is coming to my house with a proposal for my daughter
[921.84] and I should give him this
[924.24] hobby that my wife is pregnant,
[927.60] you have accepted that this thing is
[932.04] also a hobby for you,
[933.88] see,
[936.80] I am not going to judge any issue.  I don't
[940.12] want a solution, your health is also dear to me, we would have taken
[943.60] a second opinion for this,
[946.44] so you don't worry,
[949.36] you just tell me the list of what to bring, we will
[952.40] see the rest of the things later,
[984.08] I don't understand, I have just read these books,
[986.24] what arrow do I have to hit and
[988.24] anyway what is the benefit of education for girls
[991.08] brother, in the end we have to get married and
[993.08] settle down, and to win the heart of the husband, we
[999.32] need beauty and intelligence, not a degree,
[1002.76] see, you know what the matter is, you are
[1007.08] not even interested in studying and on top of that
[1009.60] you keep demotivating me,
[1012.36] this formula of yours about beauty
[1015.80] and intelligence is a total failure, that
[1019.64] everything can be found in the world except
[1022.68] luck, aunty, it would be better if you just talk about this,
[1025.76] friend Atul aunty herself is bringing a proposal to
[1028.32] our house, by the way, it seems from this that the
[1031.32] network of your luck is very
[1033.48] strong, it neither hangs nor there is an error, I am
[1041.16] scared of aunty
[1043.41] [sangeet],
[1045.28] she does not see it, it seems that we are doing a favor
[1051.36] and the more straight forward we are, the more we are, the more we are.  Yes
[1054.40] Amtula aunty is that complicated
[1058.64] and this relation of marriage is not
[1062.56] just with one person
[1065.23] [sangeet]
[1066.80] but with his entire family but aapi the person you are getting
[1069.72] married to
[1072.44] understands you right then
[1074.16] what are you worried about
[1080.32] [prasnsa]
[1081.53] [sangeet]
[1085.56] 11:2 I got this call now you must need privacy,
[1089.44] let me go out and see
[1092.60] what's happening
[1098.08] Amtula aunty you are making preparations as if you are
[1100.76] not coming with a relation but with a baraat,
[1103.56] leave it, do the rest of the work tomorrow I
[1107.76] want that there should be no lack of attention for Atul Bhabhi she is
[1110.56] coming to
[1113.28] my house for the first time for my daughter and whatever
[1116.56] happened in the marriage, after that her coming is no
[1119.68] less than a miracle
[1121.76] Momna is very lucky the
[1124.72] sparkle in her eyes has
[1128.76] forced me to forget everything Afan
[1132.44] is very true to his word I
[1135.84] cannot repay this favour of his even by giving my life
[1139.88] Yes Arham called and was saying that
[1143.48] forget all the old things for my sake, just me
[1146.04] So I am happy that you are
[1147.84] taking my daughter with great respect and honour,
[1150.80] by the way, it is Arham Bhai's plan, the talks were
[1154.12] finalised here and they got married there, I
[1157.24] think,
[1159.40] in order to celebrate Valentine's Day with you, hey, getting married so soon, wo
[1163.92] n't we make preparations
[1172.36] [Music]
[1176.32] Api Api, look what is happening to Mummy, should we
[1181.52] take Mummy to a surgeon now,
[1184.56] Homi?
[1186.12] Mummy, are you okay, what has happened?
[1190.68] Mummy has never had fever before,
[1193.80] okay,
[1197.24] you
[1198.88] bring water, yes, go and bring water, I am not having fever
[1205.96] [Music]
[1213.48] No, if I see with my eyes, there is no shortage,
[1220.08] but I am
[1223.88] Naati or Allah, just
[1228.40] put a little love for me in Naati's heart
[1231.66] [Music] what are
[1240.60] we, let me get ready,
[1245.12] Mummy is calling from there and you are bothering me by getting
[1248.16] ready, why do you need to get ready,
[1250.64] brother, it's not the first time you are meeting Mama,
[1254.96] today I see your face in my eyes every day,
[1259.16] think how many times Mama must have met
[1263.60] you, how many useless lines are there, right  And that too at this
[1267.16] time when I am so tensed, let's hang up the phone
[1275.13] [Music]
[1277.72] Hello
[1279.40] [Music]
[1287.04] Sajna
[1293.52] what's the matter
[1295.40] Shufta, you are not happy about our arrival, you are
[1297.96] looking very down, actually Ammi's
[1301.96] health is not well for three days, that's why
[1304.16] you must be feeling
[1306.76] as if you unnecessarily became so formal,
[1310.96] I don't eat all this and Afan also has
[1313.76] health issues, you know very well
[1315.80] that all the food in our house is cooked in olive oil
[1318.67] [Music]
[1348.15] [Music]
[1356.80] what
[1358.32] happened, will you keep looking or will you also tell me how you are
[1361.64] looking,
[1364.24] Mashallah, you are looking absolutely fab,
[1368.84] like a simple hero, Atu Lati, I will accept it as soon as I see you, whether you are
[1371.76] praising me or
[1374.88] criticizing me, what difference does it make, the final authority is
[1379.28] Arham Bhai's, isn't it? Amtula Aunty's
[1381.84] approval doesn't make any difference,
[1385.84] now let's stop making up stories, yes,
[1389.44] come on, this is right, absolutely right, you are
[1393.28] looking very cute, the sticks are going viral, with this it is
[1395.04] absolutely right, ok, tell me one thing, I am feeling
[1398.40] nervous, I want to
[1401.32] eat more,
[1404.04] ok baba, come on, everyone is waiting.
[1407.96] Yes, it's okay,
[1412.84] go ahead, you're looking absolutely fine, come,
[1416.08] you'll be a man, let's go with my hands, okay, okay, come on, fix your
[1418.36] dupatta,
[1422.68] Al aunty will get angry, which
[1424.44] dupatta do you wear yourself, Bhabhi, Afan bhai and
[1426.40] Abrar are friends for years,
[1429.64] I know this much about you people, you can
[1434.76] eat without worrying, times must have changed, but even today, the
[1439.12] customs of my house are made as per my wish
[1441.68] and change as per my wish,
[1444.20] now it's the life of the children, we have
[1448.96] already lived our lives,
[1450.88] I have
[1455.08] always been very impressed by your wisdom, it would have been great if
[1458.60] you had taught this wisdom to your daughter Momna as well [
[1462.58] sangeet],
[1464.04] unless the girl encourages, the
[1467.84] boy's choice becomes meaningless
[1470.66] [sangeet],
[1474.32] well, whatever was to happen has happened, and
[1480.28] even if I had picked up a girl from the street,
[1482.44] I would have kept quiet for her happiness, see
[1485.80] Bhabhi, we have left no stone unturned in the upbringing of our daughters,
[1489.64] and we know very well that they are
[1493.60] nothing in front of our happiness and our desire  You can think, I think
[1496.76] you should also do what you think is best for your safety,
[1502.76] what happened
[1506.28] friend Apara, she did not mean this, you were
[1509.68] wrong, and you know very well
[1512.32] I have never considered my daughters a burden,
[1514.76] if I have given them freedom, then I have
[1517.32] also trusted them and respected them, I am
[1520.60] proud of my daughter, she will never do anything that will make me
[1526.44] bow my head down with shame,
[1529.72] what are you saying, you are a guest, you do not talk like this in the house,
[1533.24] you came to my house, thank you very much,
[1537.16] but I do not want such a relationship
[1538.68] that affects my friendship with others
[1541.84] and I do not want
[1545.32] my Momna's head to remain bowed down all her life
[1552.90] [Sangeet],
[1554.40] I think it is better if this matter is resolved here itself,
[1559.28] Arar
[1562.40] [Sangeet]
[1572.20] Arar, now let's go from here
[1576.09] [Sangeet] [Sangeet
[1593.92] ]
[1603.08] [Sangeet]
[1616.60] Aa
[1618.34] [Praise]
[1622.77] [Sangeet]
[1626.96] your hobby has been fulfilled,
[1630.84] you have seen, how easily she
[1637.88] made a mockery of all your principles of trust, trust and understanding and went away, oh,
[1640.32] how can someone go like this,
[1642.60] I also did that with her that in future I will
[1645.32] not step on the door of my house,
[1648.68] she wanted  This was always the case, she was
[1651.52] always happy with this, but what will people say,
[1655.76] what will people say that the relationship ended even before it could happen, the
[1660.80] principles of the world never change for the parents of daughters, if they don't
[1664.00] change then it shouldn't change, I don't care about anyone,
[1666.72] I am just seeing that
[1669.40] I tortured my daughter and she
[1671.84] respected me, now don't
[1674.24] hurt me by talking about Atul Bhabhi, and my
[1676.52] heart is burning, she
[1678.20] came to fix the relationship and what kind of
[1680.44] things she said and went away, so what have we bid
[1682.76] farewell to Momna that you are making so much noise,
[1685.00] now
[1687.52] stop dreaming about this farewell, you agree, it is her
[1690.72] happiness,
[1691.84] but no happiness is greater than self-respect,
[1696.40] maybe our daughter will
[1699.72] yearn for the respect and dignity of becoming a daughter all her life
[1716.47] [Music]
[1720.92] Papa, please, why are you giving me so many explanations on Mama's words
[1723.20] and whatever
[1725.40] happened was wrong, you agree that you don't. By the
[1730.76] way, Mama gives such big lectures on family values,
[1735.28] where it is not about damaging someone else's self-
[1738.64] respect.  Where is the value?
[1741.24] Look friend, I understand that a little
[1745.36] mistake of Abrar's
[1746.92] father, Momina and his family have been hurt
[1749.92] because of uncle. Will Uncle's mistake be
[1752.28] bigger than that?
[1754.84] What kind of a way is this to talk?
[1759.04] You teach me values.
[1762.68] And that too for a girl who is
[1765.60] fixing the date of marriage with you.
[1769.04] Mama, agreeing for marriage does
[1771.08] not mean that the date has been fixed.
[1774.16] Even Areej liked Jabar, but
[1775.84] you both went with the proposal. Jabar is my brother's
[1779.56] son and Momna is the child of a man.
[1783.16] Your grandmother picked him up from the road
[1786.98] [Music]. You
[1789.80] know
[1792.08] why
[1794.04] Atul, if you don't want to do this marriage, then don't do it.
[1798.40] But you have no right to make a tamasha of Abrar like this.
[1800.24] Understand,
[1805.32] I am making a tamasha and the tamasha that is being
[1809.12] created in my house because of that girl?
[1812.84] Your mother was fond of helping the poor and
[1815.84] orphans. I have
[1818.40] no interest in doing charity. And I want to marry her.
[1827.28] What will you tell your relatives, in your business community?  Why don't you
[1828.92] tell
[1830.48] me what is the status of your daughter-in-
[1833.60] law's father? Which family does your mother-in-law belong to?
[1836.96] You keep on talking about these things all the time. I am
[1839.32] not able to understand what is the motive
[1842.60] behind this relationship of yours?
[1845.36] Why do you start fighting over every issue? It's
[1847.32] my life,
[1850.84] so the decision will be mine.
[1858.28] Life is definitely yours, but I
[1861.28] also have a right over it. Do you understand? You ca
[1864.76] n't take any decision alone.
[1874.16] Wow, the marriage is not done. There will be a business deal that is
[1880.00] fixed in the board of directors' meeting.
[1882.36] Then I do one thing, I don't get married at all. I don't want to get
[1886.16] married. No
[1888.56] one has any problem now.
[1894.91] [Music] It will
[1916.16] happen.
[1917.21] [Music]
[1930.44] Amma, I am in no hurry to get married right now.
[1934.32] Anyway, what is my age right now?
[1938.72] I have to go to university and complete my studies
[1940.76] after that I have to do a job too.
[1945.52] You do one thing, you worry about Abir's marriage. You
[1949.08] know, she
[1952.76] keeps dreaming about Umar Bukan day and night.
[1955.50] [Music] Hey
[1961.64] Umar, who is this Umar?
[1967.72] Tell me the truth. Will you tell me or should I talk to Abraaj
[1970.80] and this Kali?  What kind of drama is going on in the name of grams?
[1973.32] Yes, Ami Umar Faran is a model,
[1981.24] most charming, most
[1985.36] desirable, and anyway, Ami, do you need to buy an airplane ticket to see your dreams? No,
[1991.96] girls should not speak with their mouths wide open like this. They should
[1996.44] think before speaking.
[1999.52] What will people say if they hear it? Yes,
[2005.12] Ami, don't think about what people will think.
[2008.60] Just believe
[2011.88] that if we are destined to have some happiness
[2015.68] or any Prince Charming, he may be
[2018.48] in any corner of the world, but he will come here after roaming the whole world,
[2029.12] in this very street. By the way, I feel that the happiness that we are talking about is
[2032.08] named Arham
[2035.32] Afan. Now look, Atul aunty must be
[2038.28] preparing a script to
[2039.76] apologize. And this is not me, but Arham Bhai's
[2042.88] belief.
[2044.73] [Music] Q.
[2074.92] Salam Walekum Doctor Walekum Salam. Come, come,
[2086.72] what happened? The patient is not with you
[2090.32] [Music]
[2094.04] Or have you guys come to discuss something
[2098.09] [Music]
[2100.16] Yes, at the moment the patient is here.
[2105.92] Oh, okay, okay, no problem.
[2110.16] Come, come, I will check you up.
[2121.01] [Music]

[2129.76] yes Afan
