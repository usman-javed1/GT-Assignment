[232.24] Why did I bring you here? So that
[241.28] we can spend this night together
[250.36] [sangeet] The night is
[263.12] passing by. I don't know about Faraz and Aapi. I don't
[266.48] know where she is and
[268.16] in what condition she must be. I am suffocating thinking about it.
[270.48] Please do something Faraz, you have
[273.36] so many connections. You even got Kas arrested.
[275.40] Please do something.
[277.56] Kas has fled
[281.08] and
[283.08] he is thinking absolutely right. You are such a
[286.92] mean person
[288.24] and I am fully hopeful that he is
[291.04] behind all this. Faraz, take me to the police station right now.
[295.04] If we don't go, Faraz, it will be a
[297.40] great loss for us. Let's
[302.28] all sit down. We wo
[308.24] n't suffer any loss right now.
[313.36] Trust me, if Kas doesn't do all this, then
[316.12] you will
[316.84] see what I do with him. But
[320.12] sitting at home won't do anything, but right now,
[323.48] I can't take you anywhere.
[324.98] [sangeet] Listen to
[327.04] me,
[330.12] change your clothes, take some rest. In fact,
[333.16] sleep for a while. If something happens to you,
[337.24] I will die.  I will go, nothing will happen to my sister. You have trusted
[342.48] me, right? So don't worry
[347.32] [Music] Do you
[364.60] [Music] did you
[381.04] find out anything about Mamna's well being? Any
[385.04] call? May God have mercy on you, what a dark
[388.96] city, no one to tell, no one to listen. My
[391.88] heart is sinking, Fami.
[395.12] As the night is passing, I don't know whose
[398.24] enmity it was with that poor girl. I don't know,
[401.00] I feel as if
[406.00] Kasad took her away.
[409.24] What else, your nephew,
[414.00] why did he do all this
[416.68] [Music]?
[418.40] First he killed the father,
[421.12] now he wants to kill the girl. I do
[425.00] n't know what he will do and why he will do it. But
[428.56] believe me, if he comes in front of me
[432.00] once, I will kill that bastard with my own hands.
[433.96] Okay, come outside, let's sit outside and
[437.64] talk
[441.08] [
[449.78] Music] Do
[457.80] not give me any explanation for uncle, I have lost
[461.64] my faith. I have
[465.12] no patience with anything he says.
[470.04] He has broken me from inside.
[475.96] Uncle has hurt his son so deeply in the name of love
[482.76] that perhaps his end is not possible
[486.32] [Music]
[489.88] What kind of a mother is this,
[493.80] Baba?  She neither breaks, nor bows down, neither
[497.92] loves herself, nor lets anyone else love
[499.80] her. She does not get peace at all
[501.45] [Music]
[501.88] [Praise]
[503.40] Wherever Momina and I go, she will
[507.32] not let us be happy.
[513.24] Does she not like that? No, Mom,
[516.16] Mom is my respect, my
[519.12] happiness,
[522.12] my life. It is
[524.72] not like that, son, as you are thinking.
[529.08] Your mother may have
[531.72] harmed her community in your love, but she
[536.04] could never do such injustice to Momina. It is
[541.08] okay that till date she has
[544.56] not been able to prove herself to be good,
[547.04] but being a woman, she is
[550.04] not that bad. Papa, you are saying this. It is
[554.24] possible
[556.84] that in your love, she may have
[559.88] forgotten her values ​​of being a mother,
[564.96] but the fact that she can harm any woman,
[570.04] I cannot believe it.
[571.31] [Music]
[585.08] Son, don't
[595.40] come closer, I have felt too much love for you. [
[606.82] Music]
[612.32] What else can a bitter-hearted and criminal person like you do?
[616.75] [Music]
[620.40] Friend, listen to my advice, stop
[624.00] fighting with me, quarreling with me, getting
[630.76] angry with me, leave all this,

[639.64] agree to one small thing of mine then I will
[644.92] drop you to your house in the morning I
[648.16] promise I don't ask for anything more from you just fulfill
[654.32] one small request
[661.28] tell me I love
[663.92] you I don't want to drown in the fire of your anger and
[667.52] die
[669.60] my aunt also wanted the same thing
[672.44] that we both get married get married aunt
[677.60] this mother in law of yours was all her
[682.64] creation had we got married that day
[687.96] you would have become my wife and I
[692.24] swear to my mother the fun of spending life with such a wife is its
[696.16] own will you keep talking nonsense or will you tell me
[698.80] what the work is I will
[700.44] tell you let
[702.92] this night pass I will tell you everything as soon as the morning sun
[707.24] rises
[720.56] [sangeet]
[726.44] see it's a thing she looks very cute when angry her
[734.88] hands and legs have also started moving
[741.61] [sangeet] ha
[753.65] [sangeet]
[766.56] mummy is sleeping
[769.48] how is your health she is mummy's friend we
[774.04] talked to you comfortably did we get to know
[775.80] where Momina is
[779.93] [sangeet] the
[783.04] police is trying
[784.84] but till now no clue has been found
[787.64] I am not able to understand  What is happening?
[789.96] I too had a doubt at first
[793.00] but after seeing Mama's condition my
[797.44] doubts were dispelled. This is
[799.88] that boy's work. He is
[804.24] taking out his enmity and it is possible that his wife is in
[808.28] cahoots with him. He knows
[811.52] where Momina
[819.72] is [Sangeet]
[821.56] Hey, where am I, call her. I have to talk to her about something important.
[826.04] How can he put such a big blame on me?
[832.36] You take rest, you need peace a lot.
[837.76] Now you know that
[840.44] he went on you in anger.
[841.39] [Sangeet] He
[844.48] can say anything, he
[848.48] went on me only in anger. He took all the other good habits of
[852.24] yours
[853.72] but how did he get such a big suspicion about me?
[859.36] How did he even think that I would get his
[863.48] wife kidnapped?
[865.84] His heart has been hurt. I am
[869.80] not insulted by you for no reason. And then throughout your
[874.56] life you did not give Momina the status
[876.84] she deserved.
[878.88] What all did you not do to her,
[882.36] even to the extent that I was hell-bent on getting her married to Kasi
[885.14] [Sangeet]
[887.16] You have brought me to this state.
[890.64] Atul, now only you can give her a new life.  I
[893.52] can give her
[894.16] [Music]
[897.28] If she keeps getting disgraced like this,
[900.44] I am afraid that she will go away from all of us
[904.05] [Music]
[911.50] [Music]
[932.12] Good
[933.92] morning away
[936.36] son, you have not eaten anything since last night, if this happens,
[940.40] you will fall ill, take
[945.12] care of yourself, I know this is a very difficult time, for
[948.84] Momna's sake, you have to be courageous, she will come back and get
[952.76] very angry with you, Aunty,
[956.72] I am very scared, she will
[961.20] come back
[963.22] [Music]
[966.12] You know, she does
[969.24] not wish bad for anyone [Music] She does not
[979.56] feel bad in this world,
[981.64] still everything goes with her,
[987.52] son, Allah gives great trials to good people,
[991.68] Momna was a mother by nature, she used to take
[994.72] all the problems of both of you with herself, nothing
[999.84] bad will happen to her,
[1002.72] Allah gave her a lot of courage and
[1005.72] sent her from here and you will see that very soon she will be with us, get up, get
[1012.08] changed, come on, change your clothes,
[1018.24] then let's
[1021.88] eat something, I will just make a call
[1027.54] [Music]
[1037.36] ah, don't you think that Momna has
[1042.04] gone somewhere on her own
[1043.29] [Music]
[1044.88] I mean that no kidnapper
[1049.36] contacted her,
[1051.40] if she was kidnapped for the rituals  If he had gone then he would have had some
[1054.72] connection, wouldn't he? I
[1062.20] think there must be some reason behind Mamna's disappearance in such a big city
[1064.16] Mumma please go and
[1067.28] rest in your room, you probably need rest a lot
[1072.66] [Sangeet] It is
[1074.20] said that heaven lies under the feet of a mother
[1079.00] I don't want to be rude to you, I do
[1080.72] n't want to lose my heaven, please please
[1083.00] go, after being kidnapped from here
[1085.26] [Sangeet]
[1087.36] she will be worthy of you It is
[1093.60] very difficult
[1098.08] between you and Mamna It is not the distance of one night,
[1101.76] but a person can change into something in one night
[1110.36] If you
[1112.16] say even a single word about Momina's character, I will take my life What is it that
[1118.36] you can't tolerate hearing even a single word against her in Momina And
[1120.36] you have prepared a complete FIR against your mother You
[1124.28] always find me bad,
[1128.00] rest I had told you that whatever is
[1130.56] happening is not good, now see the
[1133.08] consequences, I will do it,
[1139.52] you just keep quiet
[1141.82] [Sangeet]
[1157.70] [Sangeet]
[1163.24] [Sangeet]
[1167.24] go
[1168.40] [Sangeet]
[1175.06] [Sangeet]
[1180.44] I am not saying anything
[1181.36] [Music] Take the
[1199.00] food, I don't refuse you, what's the
[1203.52] use of you sitting here hungry and thirsty, the
[1207.88] loss will be yours only and I do
[1211.84] n't like healthy girls anyway,
[1214.48] you don't need to sympathize with me, it's
[1218.64] my benefit, my loss, let me stay with me,
[1225.32] think of your loss which will come to you after this act
[1230.88] [Music]
[1237.24] you will come in my situation and what do you think,
[1240.16] after keeping you here for four days, when I
[1243.92] leave you, that
[1246.76] man of yours will accept you, stop this nonsense, nothing
[1250.64] like this will happen in my life as long as I am alive,
[1255.40] you are saying this,
[1258.84] now both of our lives are one and my
[1261.92] opinion, we should think about each other I feel
[1264.72] sorry for
[1267.40] those parents who have children,
[1271.68] you must only curse them
[1274.80] and you are not worthy of anything, no
[1278.60] parent would ever
[1281.20] want that their child should have a child
[1283.40] like you, how much heart would it hurt, it doesn't hurt their heart, it
[1290.64] hurts,
[1291.80] they don't even remember that they had a
[1294.88] son,
[1296.68] now your curses and blessings are the
[1300.24] issue of people like you, who have lost their love  You get
[1302.60] their company too and no one like
[1304.28] me does.
[1307.80] Do you think
[1312.00] that all that you are doing will take us
[1316.48] away from each other? This is what I want.
[1319.84] You have started to like me.
[1323.32] You have
[1324.60] started to love me. I am starting to like you. If you are a
[1327.96] strong and daring girl like you, then it is great.
[1331.84] And with such a girl, settling down is a different kind of
[1335.68] fun.
[1337.88] For people like you, it is
[1340.84] not home but a jail. Be afraid of your consequences.
[1345.68] You will not be able to escape from this jail.
[1349.36] I have done everything and will save me from it.
[1355.08] Well done, eat the food. I will tell you everything. You do
[1359.64] n't want to
[1361.24] eat. Tell me what you want to do.
[1369.96] Get the case of your father's murder withdrawn. Tell me, sign it. I will leave the house with decency.
[1382.36] Yes Bir, listen, where are you?
[1386.52] Come home, for God's sake. Sameer has become tired of crying. He is
[1390.48] neither eating nor drinking anything. He is
[1394.28] not even drinking milk. I am having a lot of trouble.
[1396.48] He has got a very high fever. I
[1399.08] feel he will have to go to the hospital. Come quickly,
[1402.80] please. I am not able to understand anything. I have
[1406.36] even made porridge.  I tried feeding him, he is not there,
[1409.40] yes, come quickly, stop this nonsense,
[1413.52] I will never do such a thing, even if I
[1417.12] lose my life, do you understand
[1420.77] [Music]
[1422.16] I will take your life,
[1424.64] but a
[1429.56] man lives after killing your brother, and
[1433.60] whether he does it once or twice, there is no punishment,
[1438.44] your brother is very dear to you, aren't you? If you
[1441.24] want his life, then spare my life, put him to sleep, will you keep running around the
[1446.20] courts and courts?
[1453.04] Nothing will come to your hands, both money and time are wasted, put him to
[1457.68] sleep, sign for me, look, if you are
[1462.56] thinking that the police will catch me, then
[1465.48] before going to jail, I have to take my revenge,
[1470.32] what do you think, I will get
[1474.84] scared of your lizard,
[1477.20] never,
[1481.28] I will never forgive you, you
[1485.36] deserve punishment, not forgiveness, you
[1490.92] deserve to be hanged
[1492.65] [Music] You

[1716.88] health, she is not well, she is searching for you even in this condition,
[1721.60] where have you gone, why are
[1723.92] you not searching for her, you have
[1726.96] so many relations with her, why can't you find out anything about
[1728.48] her, what are you feeling, am I not
[1731.24] worried, I am not worried about her,
[1733.72] my life is at stake, friend, it's
[1738.68] all my fault, why did I leave her alone,
[1740.64] son Aram, small mouth, big talk, but
[1745.44] you should also ask your mother,
[1748.16] maybe she knows something,
[1750.28] see, my nephew, if  If he had not escaped from the jail then
[1754.44] I would never have said this,
[1757.80] but Kasani does not have the courage to do anything wrong
[1761.32] with Momna, he needs
[1765.36] some big support,
[1768.08] then he can do anything, wait a minute,
[1771.16] what are you trying to say? Mama approached Kass
[1774.98] [Music]
[1776.52] Look son, right now I too
[1779.80] cannot say anything with certainty, the way you have been
[1783.88] thinking since yesterday, my mind is also thinking in the same way,
[1786.92] how
[1790.00] can Momna have any enmity with anyone, yes, but whenever I
[1794.20] think about Mamna, I
[1797.88] remember Begum when she had said that
[1800.84] I will take Momna away from Arham at any cost,
[1803.96] whether by getting her married or
[1807.24] what are you saying, Arham Bhai is already
[1811.04] very worried, please do not say such
[1812.84] things, we all are worried, right?
[1816.92] I was just saying that, well please forgive me
[1821.28] if something wrong came out of my mouth,
[1823.08] no, I did not feel bad about anything you
[1826.24] said, maybe you are right,
[1830.12] our thinking is a reflection of our determination, the
[1835.72] form you have of Mama  I have seen, perhaps she is talking in the same way,
[1838.00] we are your brother and mother, it is better to talk to her than to her, but even
[1841.52] thinking like this is a sin for her,
[1845.72] and please do not put things wrong
[1849.36] in our hearts, not
[1852.44] right now, my father also says the same thing to me, I don't know
[1858.28] why, his heart has
[1860.04] completely gone away from him, the
[1862.04] relationship on which we worry the most in life is the
[1866.44] relationship of a mother
[1868.92] [Music],
[1870.04] but if it gets hurt once on that Sunday,

[2034.00] That is why I am sitting in front of you. Zinda
[2036.68] Salaam.
[2037.76] This is not the answer to my question. [
[2039.79] Music]
[2041.80] You are my wife. [
[2044.11] Music]
[2046.32] Momina, and what do I want to ask
[2049.20] you? It is not necessary for me to ask you a question.
[2053.08] You should understand from my silence
[2055.96] what I am asking you.
[2058.56] Your silence and your eyes are making me
[2061.72] panic. I am
[2064.76] scared. I
[2070.60] never thought that
[2072.84] you would look at me in this way. It is my helplessness.
[2079.64] So much has happened in our lives
[2084.80] that I think 100 times before doing anything.
[2089.08] I have started fearing myself. I do
[2094.52] n't trust anyone.
[2100.80] It's not that simple.
[2104.72] Momina, if he wanted to finish the case, he
[2108.16] could have come to meet you or to this house.
[2111.32] Why would he kidnap you and take the risk?
[2114.20] Because he is a mad man.
[2116.40] If it wasn't so, why would he
[2119.32] kill Baba for a few thousand rupees?
[2122.84] You are so mad,
[2125.80] then he must have tried to get away with it.
[2134.28] Shut up, tell me the truth.
[2137.80] I won't tolerate your lies.
[2142.56] Momina, if it's true  If you tell me, maybe I'll agree Do
[2147.16] n't lie to me
[2152.36] Just
[2154.20] tell me
[2158.18] [Music] Has he done
[2163.04] anything wrong to you Just do it
[2170.23] [Music]
[2173.88] If I had known
[2176.68] that when I return I'd be
[2179.64] asked for proof of my cleanliness and purity I would have brought it
[2184.48] I never thought that you would look at me
[2187.36] like this And talk to me
[2188.32] like this [
