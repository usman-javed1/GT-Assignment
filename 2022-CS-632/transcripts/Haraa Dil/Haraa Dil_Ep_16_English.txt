How will it be? I don't know How will it be? There has been such a big loss. Brother, let's go inside and talk. It does n't feel good to talk at the door. Come on, you also come inside and see, he wo n't feel bad. Come, let's introduce you well. I knew that you can win anyone's heart and you can play the band of anyone like this, so I never thought of this. There is no need to be impressed. When I get angry, I do n't treat anyone well. What is the need to keep such a big anger on this small nose? You had come to help me, right? You weren't you. Why am I saying this? I will explain later. Or if we want to discuss about your father, then let's go ma'am. Abrar Bhai's daughters are very lucky and there is a great family, a lot of money, but his heart got stuck in Momna and now this is the other one who is touching the skies. And there is my wretched girl Nala, she is simple and foolish, how could any decent proposal come for her Hey look Jeba, these boys from high class families, they don't get married, they just fool the girls like this and their choice is free thinking and the most stupid girls, so that even if there is some high and low, then there is no one to come after these poor girls I have solved many such cases, all the traces of sin are cleared because of me, repent, what have you got into, apologize to Allah, it is a big sin, Fahmi, you know, oh oh oh, it is a big sin and why should I think, will the environment change if I think so, those who are committing crimes should think, I only wash away the sins of people, now see, she left the house saying she was going to college, she did not bring her slipper with her, if it was my Nala, I swear I would not have even let her enter the house, let it be, if it comes to my daughter, no one can do anything and me too  I will wait for two-four days only, see how I will pull you out of the house by holding your hair and make you stand there, so do n't make this mistake, don't you know Abrar bhai is respected a lot in the locality, if you create such a drama then those people will leave you, otherwise I don't have any respect in the locality, she will do whatever she wants, I will not see the people of the locality also, you eat guava, forget all the talks, never listen to me carefully, just let it be, these days Keenu has become very bad, otherwise it doesn't seem that your baba has been targeted, this seems like a street crime and to close such cases, the police have many jawans, there is IG, but we do n't meet them, now you will have to meet them, let's go, if you are saying, then I will definitely meet Abir, go and bring tea for them [Music] Come, you want to talk to me, will you marry Abir, no, after baba's whim, if during this time you take your parents here  If he comes, it will be better I don't have any problem with this relationship and as far as my Mama is concerned, I know her, she won't have any problem either and if you change, then I don't believe in talking but in proving it What are you trying to prove, my Aapi has proved it, she has come here on your one call only [Sangeet] Those who are true do n't come through the backdoor [Sangeet] Now you are not angry with me, right? No, today for the first time you have done a very good job, you all have tea, till then I will get something for Sunny [Sangeet] He is such a small brother of you all and as far as I think this child has had a very negative impact on your life [Sangeet] Today for the first time I took him in my lap, this [Sangeet] brother of ours took away all the happiness from your life and those who brought him into this world considering him as the support of his old age are no more in this world Life is such that here a person thinks something and something else happens, I do n't know what is going to happen in my and your life [Music] It 's your Baba's case don't you be worried [Music] it's ours after cooking so much [Music] take it brother it will be fun today there's a cup of tea there's a baby in it as well [ Music] no hey Momna please get some deal from outside brother my heart is getting upset after eating a lot of this dal yes bring milk as well I have a habit of drinking hot milk before sleeping after taking medicines at night otherwise my BP gets low my health becomes very bad should I bring it but Baba used to make you spend all the money I don't have any money at all whatever little money I had I have spent it on stuff look brother as soon as your father left you put all the blame on me what do you think I have taken over your father's property I don't have any other work wife you must know your father very well how miserly his father was your father used to give money after counting it so wife I do n't have anything it was all in your father's pocket now God knows where it has gone [Music]  Look, don't talk about Baba, what have I told you, I am just saying that Baba used to give you money for expenses, so do one thing, take off your shoe and hit me on the head, do n't grab my hair and throw me out of the house, no, the money is spent, come on, tell me what to do, I don't do anything, I starve, I sit and sit, it doesn't make any difference, it's obvious, I don't get ration from the neighbors, don't sit and sit, there's no need to tell me so much, I was good, I was living a luxurious life even without marriage, I also used to work in my own house, I had a wish to raise a child, but after coming here, the trouble fell on me, now how will I raise these three people, a trouble has fallen on me, I am sitting in Iddat, I feel ashamed, if I get out of Iddat, then go and do some job and feed all of you, from where will I get money now, Baba used to respect the guests who came to the house, if you cannot respect them, then at least keep quiet, he has gone away Thank God that they left our house, they are guests, wife, they are good for an hour or two, these people who come and settle here for five hours, who will they be and from where has this homeless life started, you people don't even have any elder, I don't understand, to whom should I go and complain, if there was someone in the family, I would have seen how you people show all these symptoms, if you were a family, then you would not have been in this house because the elders of the house are the ones who stop the elders from doing bad, this sister of yours talks a lot, I don't know what your mother had to eat, she just does n't accept defeat, this girl, see, I am respecting you a lot, it will be better for you also that you take my mother's name with respect, why should I do this, I respect your mother and what did I say to her by abusing her that you felt so bad, oh Allah, I will pull the ground from under your feet, she will remember it all her life, you do n't feel ashamed, ha ha, break it, it is your father's only, you are throwing everything and showing me your style, it as if I don't know all this  Aren't you ashamed It's gone cold, who will eat it [Music] [Music] Can I tell you one thing now? I don't think that your Baba's second wife's behaviour did not look good to me. I mean that the entry of a new family member could also be made a part of the police investigation. I never thought about it. I know that your grief is very big. But despite that, instead of sitting at home and crying, you want to do something for your Baba. Your aggressive approach will make our relationship very strong. Our relationship, yes, what I have decided with Momna, do you mind it? Can it be wrong? You are very aggressive and complicated too. Let's go to the police station. I want to keep this case separate from my desire. [Music] I 'm inside [Music] Come on [ Music] Everything's okay, are you? I do n't know what happened. Looking at you, it seems as if you had no interest in coming shopping with me. In fact, it is clearly written on your face that even though you are with me, you are not with me [Music] [Music] I feel that we could be happy together too soon I did it too soon but I could not finish my conversation I feel that we should give some time to our relationship Not us, it's you Hey, I don't know about you but I have never even thought about any other girl in my life except you It's not that other girls did not want to come into my life [Sangeet] But I have always waited only for you Well, I can understand this thing That it is not that easy to ignore you I will accept this thing only when you stop ignoring me I used to think that you were very practical If I was not practical then I would have been sitting with you right now here Yes, that's true as well Okay, you won, I lost [Sangeet] I definitely like you to win But I really like good people [Sangeet] Do you think that I will run away from my responsibilities Is that the problem I want to become your priority in your responsibility [Sangeet] Forget it I think we should go because you had no interest in coming with me anyway You were not interested in anything  You will not eat it, does it matter to you [music] Now you have got time to come to me, I have seen your Bir with some other boy, what is this affair going on outside, tell me the truth, Khala, you too are not doing anything with me, now I will marry such a girl who is having an affair with someone else before marriage, hey, stop crying, he is some nephew of IG, DIG, she is roaming around with him, he is helping in Abrar sahab's case, these policemen are not anyone's own, Khala and I don't like it that she keeps getting upset with the police station and court and what do you do at home all day, Khala, you are not able to handle such a small girl, you are of no use, Khala, hey, such a small girl, where is she from, she is so big, she talks a lot and why does she go and ask me, who am I to her, what do they call her, her late father's wife, widow, yes the same widow, I am always scared, I don't know when these people will grab my ears and throw me out of the house  They will throw me out and make me stand there Neither am I able to bear the pain nor take the house [Sangeet] I will get the papers of the house transferred in your name Give it to me Give me your wife You are a widow right or why are you happy being my widow I can see everything Those papers are with me [Sangeet] but what is the issue [Sangeet] The papers have neither Abrar saheb 's name nor mine On them there is the name of his late wife and after her of their children We have nothing in that, tell me what will we do now [Sangeet] By the way Khala you told me the other day that this brave man is very bad minded and bad tempered [Sangeet] but mom there is no flaw in him so he is made for me Get me married to Momna Momna will be my wife and the house will be in Momna 's name Whose house is it oh nephew's aunt Your life will not pass peacefully Will it look wide for both of us aunt I say life will become peaceful Just find an opportunity and get us married What's the matter?  Shameless, her father's wish hasn't been fulfilled yet, you are busy getting married, you feel ashamed, what should I do from here, I am sitting around for 40 and you too keep playing games with your legs crossed all day, nothing happens, I am also going, the same thing comes to my mind, get me married, what have I achieved after getting married, I am sitting as a widow, I don't know the address of my house, I just play the game of the ghat, when the accusation is made, then do the full [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] come [Music] after all, what is the purpose of keeping all Baba's things with you, I will go and ask now, no, I have to act wisely [Music] what is it, sister, why is the door locked, are you alright, did someone come or not, no, I was just putting Sami to sleep, that's why, if now, how can anyone be trusted, anyone can come at any time, it's not someone's father's house that someone will come just like that, it's our house [Music] Bhai sister, send this lady away from here as soon as possible, no, not now, now, I mean you still have to take them to their house  I have to keep it in my house [Music] No, look, her respect has not been fulfilled yet, just like this, the sin will come upon us for no reason, what are you afraid of, what are you afraid of Veer, just look, whatever it is, but she was there in Baba's marriage, she was also Baba's wife, so it is her right to stay in this house till the completion of her Iddat, that's it, nothing else, you are like Amma not only in looks but also in habits, well I am fine, but now I ca n't do anything about this, just tell me if there was any appearance in Baba's case, yes there was one appearance, Faraz feels that Baba has been targeted and his suspicion is on this madam [Music] [Music] [Music] what is this, you have cleared all the dues, but whose signature is present here, to Mrs. Farar, we have paid the dues, our intention is to pay whatever dues are there legally to the widow on time, I think your mother has not told you and my mother is not there, if she had known about this respect of honor, then she would have come in front of you with empty hands  I would have been sitting here [Music] [Music] [Music] Thank you [Music] [Music] Baba, my heart wants me to die too, but how can I leave Abir and Sami at the mercy of this woman? I don't know why she has come to our house. You didn't care for me at all, but I care for your children. I never thought that our lives would suddenly become so difficult. [Music] Now set your face right, Fiza beta, what happened aunty? I think that now you should take some action seriously. And the girl is not even going out of Arham's life. You know how I feel when I am with Arham. I feel as if even though she is with me, she is not with me. She is in that girl's thoughts. And you know what new excuse she has found these days. She keeps complaining all the time. Don't wear this, don't wear that. Don't meet this person, don't meet that person. Her thinking has become like those people. I am going mad. Arham is not at fault in this. Fiza Afan wanted Arham to get married to that girl.  I tried explaining to him a lot but he never listened to me. I always said that we should not mix with such people who are not of any benefit to us. See, those who lived in the annex till yesterday will now come and sit next to us, aunty. You have removed those people from the NC, how will you remove them from Arham's heart, son? Don't worry. Arham is definitely stubborn but he is not a boss himself. I just know that he is confused. I am not worried about his confusion. You just start preparing for the wedding. I do n't want any further delay in your marriage. Aunty, you are amazing. Tell me one thing, will Arham marry anyone on your saying? And I forgot, you were the one who had promised us that my dear son, I will not trouble you at all now. I will not come in between in any of your decisions. Yes, yes son, I want to see him settled, so his disturbance will end. I will talk to him today itself. You just have to keep a check on whom he is meeting and where he is going. It is now your responsibility to handle him with love. [Music] Son, of course, your son fell asleep crying for you. What a thing! If you are a little around, he misses you. He is a child, he has never seen a mother. That is why, whoever loves him like a mother, he becomes his. Well, goddess of love. Now, tell me what to do about the dues. The electricity bill has come and the gas bill is also pending for two months. Mrs. Fahmida Abrar, she has collected the dues. What a woman! I will kill her. Stay seated. Come here. The more you make noise, the more that woman will become attached to her. We will have to handle her in many ways. This is too much, Aapi. Even after so much, you are saying that we have to handle her politely. Yes, one should talk to him according to his status. [Music] Afaan uncle had also said the same thing. The smaller and meaner the enemy is, the lower we will have to stoop from our level. If only Baba had listened to us, Afaan uncle, then we would not have to see this day with this woman, Aapi Afaan uncle.  What is it and he did not come to meet me, he did not even come to Baba's funeral [Music] That day it was Aram's engagement, Ram did not even come, so what happened to his love for you, that affection, he did not keep even that honor, no one keeps anyone's honor [Music]
