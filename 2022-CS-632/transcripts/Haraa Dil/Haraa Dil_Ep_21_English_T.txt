[112.18] [Music]
[118.84] Thank you
[123.28] Momina, I am talking to you,
[125.84] I want to hear the truth, the absolute
[130.84] truth, was Mumma going to get you and Kas married, was there
[134.60] any planning, and did you
[137.00] know about this, your mother
[139.60] told you, you didn't
[143.12] tell me, Momina, I am asking you, tell me,
[147.16] what is the use of all these things,
[154.48] after what I have heard from there, all these things have no value,
[157.20] I want an answer to my question, if I
[159.92] get the answer, then why are you asking me
[166.97] [
[179.91] Music]
[188.56] Yes,
[194.44] whatever happened, happened, I want to
[198.36] forget all that  I want
[203.36] you to forget
[205.37] [sangeet] it's
[208.68] my mistake
[216.72] I should never have said yes to that marriage
[219.73] [sangeet]
[222.40] and then I shouldn't have gone to that house with you
[229.12] even after that I had
[232.08] hoped from aunty that
[235.44] she will forgive me and give me a
[241.36] place in that big house even though it was small because of
[244.52] your relationship
[247.00] [sangeet]
[249.16] this didn't happen
[253.16] and neither is there any possibility of it happening it's
[258.52] better this
[262.83] [sangeet]
[267.96] that we end it forever
[281.28] how easy it is for you to
[284.80] end this relationship every time
[288.21] [sangeet] I have
[293.52] no value for you I have a
[300.32] lot of value what else is there
[302.92] in my life except you this is
[307.80] my truth
[313.04] Amtula aunty will never understand you were the only one who
[317.40] resided in my empty eyes you were my
[322.52] wish and desire you were my prayer in the mind of relationships
[332.04] false
[335.04] stories are not easy O God I have forgotten the memories my
[343.56] heart is lost my love my love my love my love my
[351.12] love I
[384.48] know at
[387.20] this moment this thing will sound very bitter
[396.16] You should support your husband in every situation. Don't
[403.36] ruin your home by getting influenced by his mother. I am
[404.92] telling you the truth. His
[407.16] mother seems crazy to me. She is stupid
[411.40] and
[414.88] arrogant. If such a woman becomes a mother, then she should be
[418.76] praised by Allah.
[420.28] Otherwise, such a woman is not capable of becoming a mother.
[423.08] Please keep quiet.
[424.20] I did not ask you for advice.
[427.88] I cannot even give advice. I
[432.04] can only curse her. He is a
[433.48] good boy. Don't
[436.44] ruin your home by thinking about his mother.
[440.44] And what will you lose if he
[444.44] himself becomes a shield and stands in front of his mother to
[447.08] become your support.
[450.36] Look
[464.23] [Music]
[481.72] I don't have any explanation for this
[484.30] [Music] I want a
[488.04] divorce from Papa. Do whatever
[491.28] you want to do.
[496.76] Now, whether you are there or not, it does
[499.56] n't matter to me.
[505.28] What is the respect of a mother and the love of a mother? I have
[508.24] forgotten everything. What nonsense are you talking about?
[511.72] You are saying the truth.
[515.20] I am saying the truth.
[520.28] And along with that, listen to my last words.
[524.36] I don't want to stay in this house. I am leaving
[527.76] this house and your life as
[530.48] well. You cannot tolerate Momina in this house.  I am
[539.84] going alone in this house,
[540.76] son.
[546.20] Listen to me, baba. Please don't ask
[549.84] me to stay. I don't want to stay in this house where my uncle's pride and his attitude
[555.44] lives. I'm sorry, leave me in this condition.
[560.20] Please take care of yourself,
[568.12] son.
[582.66] [Music] You are
[599.52] going to meet your wife. I am
[601.20] not bound to answer you. Wait,
[603.84] wait, you have to listen to me.
[606.60] What do you want to say?
[608.56] You are going to take Mamna.
[611.28] Okay, bring her, although she
[615.96] went from here on her own. I
[618.64] also did not ask her to leave from here without your permission. Well,
[621.76] you don't find any of her mistakes wrong. Go and bring
[624.36] her, but that child will
[628.64] not come here with her.
[635.16] A small orphan child cannot be cared for
[638.40] in my house.
[641.48] I am feeling sorry for your thinking today. The
[646.12] charity dramas that you keep doing every
[648.88] day, stop it. A small child will
[652.64] make your life difficult. Listen to
[655.36] me. It's not so easy to raise someone else's child.

[1081.24] what it means to be a mother, the look
[1087.04] on the face of a mother whose son is lying in this condition,  There is no pride, there is laughter, there is prayer, there is worry, there are
[1094.36] no accusations It is
[1096.76] very easy to become a mother
[1101.76] Aunty, but to become a mother one has to sacrifice oneself A
[1107.32] mother can sacrifice her life for her son if she wants,

[1468.96] [Music]
[1482.88] Sajna, I think I shouldn't have
[1485.32] come here I am with you,
[1487.84] you should have realized your status and position by now
[1490.72] Mama, I think you should
[1494.36] also leave, take some rest and
[1498.08] then you are thinking absolutely right, you should
[1500.56] also go home,
[1502.04] you people need not worry about Aram, didn't
[1504.88] you people see
[1507.64] how relaxed he has become as soon as Momna came,
[1510.28] you cannot remain silent, I have been silent since morning,
[1513.48] now maybe you should not feel even a bit of shame Momina,
[1516.88] about Aram, marriage is made in heaven, maybe
[1520.84] this is what is called, you people should also accept this truth,
[1528.76] what has happened, you are
[1531.64] just a little worried because of Arham and nothing else,
[1535.12] if you are worried then keep your worries
[1537.76] to yourself
[1540.16] [Music]
[1551.24] no, I know you
[1555.40] regret your defeat more than Aram's accident
[1559.16] because you have won and lost the game,
[1561.64] talk within your limits, I am saying absolutely right
[1564.36] because I know you very well,
[1567.84] you should not regret at all, rather at this
[1571.88] time we all are worried  We
[1574.12] should be thankful that Arham's life was saved. I don't know due to whose
[1577.96] prayers Allah saved his life.
[1581.52] What do you want to say that I did
[1585.12] not pray for my son. There can be no
[1588.08] prayer more powerful than a mother's. A
[1591.60] wife's
[1596.24] prayer is a relation connected to life. She
[1600.48] leaves the parents, sister and brother with the support of this belief.
[1603.68] So why shouldn't her prayer have any hope.
[1608.44] Wow brother, today someone is talking very wisely.
[1613.08] When you
[1615.32] see a loved one so close to death, then you understand.
[1619.56] You also feel someone's pain.
[1622.80] What do you mean?
[1626.80] He is your brother.
[1629.12] Seeing him so close to death, I realized
[1632.92] how much I love him. So at this
[1636.72] time you should be with your loving brother.
[1640.64] Momina is with her. She can take better care of him than all of us.
[1646.52] You should be worried about
[1650.72] what will be your role in his life after Momina.
[1653.08] Areej. In what tone are you talking to her? Do you
[1655.88] know what your relationship is
[1658.20] with Fiza? Do you forget, Mama,
[1661.20] relationships are maintained from both sides. I got
[1663.80] married to Jawar or you?  I had a desire
[1667.92] but did you ever feel this relation, did
[1670.28] you never see love in it,
[1676.52] right? I am sorry honey, but even in this it is
[1680.36] your fault that no one can love you.
[1686.04] We all are afraid of your selfishness. No, I am not the only one responsible for this,
[1691.28] but this love
[1693.59] [sangeet]
[1694.92] which Sawar and I could not have for each other.
[1699.56] Mama you know
[1702.28] Sawar is a very practical person.
[1705.84] He has a brain but
[1711.72] no heart. And if there are no emotions in a person's life, if there is
[1716.32] no love, then there is no
[1719.28] use of his life.
[1723.00] Inf aunty, I cannot tolerate all this anymore.
[1727.20] You are insulting me and my brother. Have you
[1730.68] thought for even a minute what the end result of all this is, the
[1733.96] truth is that you should
[1737.84] accept Momina? Do you think
[1741.20] this ring in your hand will do some miracle?
[1743.20] Aunty, you have seen that he has gone mad. He
[1750.24] talks to his brother in the same way. That is why he does not like to see his face. He goes
[1752.32] out of the city after pretending to be his father.
[1756.92] I am seeing everything,
[1759.64] that one girl has come.  Because of you
[1762.96] everything has changed

[2140.60] lost my mind brother, you understand me,
[2142.92] I have made my choice and
