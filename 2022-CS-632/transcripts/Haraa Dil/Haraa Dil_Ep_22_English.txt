I will go and ask her right now. Aunty, please stop it. Your asking won't make any difference in this house. And let me tell you one last thing. What is the biggest problem in this house? Because of you, no one in this house can breathe freely because you try to impose your decisions on everyone. If you correct yourself, Aunty, then all the problems of this house will be solved. You are not going anywhere until Jawar comes. I heard you, you did not come to this house because of Jawar Bhai. I came because of myself, Aunty, and the reason for which I came does not exist now. It would be better if I leave. What are you trying to say? Tell me clearly, Aunty, Haram is no longer the same person. Haram is not the same person for whose love I was drawn here [Sangeet], he has changed and I am not one of those girls who compromise and give their life in anyone's hands. It would be better if I leave from here [ Sangeet] [Sangeet] Begum Sahiba  Begum Sahiba what happened, you feel you are not well, come here Areej Bibi Areej Bibi see what happened to Begum Saba, Mama, Mama what has happened, go and bring water for Mama, okay Mama, take this, Mama, you are well, bring water, quickly Mama, I will call the doctor, I am not feeling well, you and Haram, if you let me be well, I will feel better, right? What did you do, you slapped Pizza, it was very important to teach your ill-mannered niece a lesson, if she would have said more nonsense, I would have killed her, be thankful that she did not come to this house as your daughter-in-law, Ana, first of all, I would have thrown you out of this house, you know she thinks we all are psychos, what difference does it make, she may think anything, but at least you and you and Jawar, do not create problems in your life, you have forgotten that she is her sister, it does not matter to me, now leave the worry of my Jawar, please Mama, worry about yourself, the person who has come from Dubai to Karachi to ask about Am, Aaya I don't want to have any expectations from him Aa Armaan has given him enough tension that you are creating a new drama Mama please do n't talk about Fiza and her brother at this time Please worry about Aaram You don't want him to come back home soon Then think about his happiness My chapter is closed Let it remain close [Music] Give me this to drink [Music] Water Mama please allow me I want to go to Momina's house I want to repay the debt of responsibilities After that I will come back to you people forever I had promised Abhir that I wo n't let him feel the absence of an elder brother in his wedding So that's why But this can also happen Let it be Afan sahab Whatever you are thinking, nothing like this can happen You are going two hands ahead of your mother in your stubbornness Okay, go but come back soon Papa is not angry with me, right No son, not at all Rather I am happy You are realizing your responsibility [ Music] Come on why did you stop Momina from coming here Mama that is her house  She is Arham's wife, he loves her so much, why has she become a wall between them now? I don't understand that so much has happened but your thinking hasn't changed yet. Areej, you have started talking too much. Shut up. What do I have to do? Let me think. This is my issue, not yours. Pay attention to your home. What do I pay attention to? You forget your position. If you talk to your brother, he won't call you. You have to convince him. Look, Ari, there are ups and downs in married life, but one should know how to handle them wisely. I wo n't call anyone. And the wisdom that you expect from me, I expect the same from you too. [Sangeet] oh, ah, bibi, this has come from the post office. Is it in your name ? [Sangeet] [Sangeet] [Sangeet] [Sangeet] what did he do? [Sangeet] this had to happen one day. Why did it have to happen? No, this can't happen. I won't let this happen. I will talk to my brother, how can he do this? He 's my sister's son. I taught him. [Sangeet]  I made them worthy of this, so many favors to both of them, and I will forget all my favors There are no favors in relationships Relationships run on love, so didn't I love them? You might have loved them, but there was no love in our relationship, it was just a contract The contract is over, the car doesn't need me anymore [Sangeet] Now what will you talk to him about? This is an insult to me [Sangeet] [Sangeet] It will be your turn to go away [Sangeet] For a while, tell me one thing You should be with Reeza right now Maybe this is the biggest thing in her life If you are with her, she will get it I don't know what you want to say But where do you get the courage to go in front of her You know all this is happening to me If you had married Fiza, then nothing would have happened with me [Sangeet] If something can still happen, then what can still happen What do you mean if marrying Fiza makes the patient 's house stop it Momna Don't talk nonsense to me Are you crazy or is your love just a drama for me Hey there is no difference between you and mom go from here leave me [Music] [Music] Alone Arham Arham tell me I am listening I don't like your secret Bakul ok leave me then why [Music] go because I found you with a lot of desires why do you say such things you don't talk to me [Music] that I don't understand are you giving time to your business or running away from me tell me so that my expectations also end your expectations are very strange I thought you were so strong minded that you don't need anyone else I am talking about our relationship not about anyone else I am married to you and no one else don't behave in a practical and typical housewife way it's not good and it's very simple that you enjoy your life and let me do my work see I don't interfere in your personal problems nor do I interfere in your family matters you should evolve from this  You will find out what is common between you and me No, I don't understand Everyone needs space in their life Anyways I am getting late for office and yes, I will not come to your cousin's wedding tomorrow I don't need you either [Sangeet] [Sangeet] I am [Sangeet] how I am very upset for you Why are you upset then what about you [Sangeet] how I used to feel that you have no interest in brothers I also used to feel the same You used to fight with uncle for Momna I used to laugh But now I have realized that life definitely matters somewhere [Sangeet] Samar never fell in love with me So maybe I also started expecting something like this from him I will talk to him if you tell me Right now just a legal notice has come You will beg for love from the husband for me And I will call the thing that you ask for mine Do you think I am like that [Sangeet] No But I have never seen me broken and defeated like this [Sangeet] Don't worry [Sangeet] [Sangeet] Areej's passion has shown us this day. Jawar is absolutely right. Areej never tried to build a relationship. You probably went to meet Jawar. Yes, I had asked Areej to give me the divorce back. So what did he say? I mean what was your deal with him? Why are you overreacting so much? You know that I am so tensed right now. The stain of divorce that is going to be attached to Areej is not an ordinary thing. You are considering it an ordinary thing. It is not such a big deal. It happened a few days ago. You were also thinking something similar for yourself. What is a normal thing for Momina or you, how can it be so extraordinary for Areej? Just do it and stop talking like this. Now you have started talking a lot. Leave it. So what was the deal with me? My marriage with you, your business, whatever it is, he can become a partner in it. But the happiness of Areej's house is in your hands now. Mama, you let it be. I am leaving. Where are you going? That is not your house. That is your Nikai wife.  This is her house, what would people say, what would people think, people don't have that much time, so you too should not think, Abir's wedding is after two days, I do n't want to leave my work incomplete [Sangeet], this decision of yours has broken her and she is not the same as she was with you before [Sangeet], after you left, she realized that she never wanted to be separated from you, so what can happen now, everything can happen, look, there is still time in the hands of both of you, it is very difficult and I am not so selfish that I will hurt Fiza for my own happiness, look, I am responsible for whatever happened with Fiza, why are you punishing Reez for this, then you yourself are selfish that you gave so much pain to Harish for Fiza's happiness, there is no use in reliving old things and you know better than me how to maintain a forced relationship, I just know that this forced relationship had made a place in Reez's heart [Sangeet], if you want, everything can be like before, please think once, do you want it to be like before  Yes, why not? She is waiting for you only. Do you want you and Fiza to be together again? Answer [Music] I am leaving [Music] Why did you come? I came to meet Jwar. There was no benefit to me. Fiza, you know I am married to a girl who thinks beyond the benefits of her caste and humans and she forces me to think like this. I am learning from her to be happy in the happiness of her loved ones. So you also think, where did you come from in the midst of Jwar and Areej's happiness? If Jwar Bhai and Areej were happy with each other, then no one could have come between them just like no one could have come between you and Mamna [Music] Take care of yourself [Music], look at me and talk. What is left to talk brother? So what, what you told aunty and talked to Erich, was all a lie [Music] Who accepts defeat brother, who likes to accept defeat [Music] I also did the same thing that anyone would have done in my place. I put the blame of my defeat on someone else and I have always been like this.  I will keep doing it because I have never learnt to lose. What happened? What are you doing? You see, if I want, I can turn your defeat into a victory. There is a difference in winning and achieving. Brother, you are saying that I got my every insistence accepted and I fulfilled all your insistence. [Music] Why are we talking about all this brother, just tell me when are we leaving from here because I cannot stay here any longer. I am getting suffocated now. I too am starting to get suffocated. [Music] Salam walekum, please show me the sets for the wedding and show me the red one. [Music] It is good. Look, there is red in it too. Yes, it is matching very well with my sets. [Music] Hello, where are you? Since when have you left the house? The shopping should have been done by now. Now there is wedding shopping, friend. It will take some time. I am coming in a little while. Look, come quickly. I have to go to the clinic. Where is Samindra Sami's newly-wed mother? Why are you not handing him over to her? Now good.  ok sorry sorry sorry holding my ears sorry I am coming in a little while come quickly Khuda hafiz abhi what do you think in my opinion Momna should not waste time for Sami he should understand the feelings of harem very well I do n't know what is going on between both of them in my opinion there is only one solution of this issue and we should shift Momna with us to our house so that Atul aunty cannot disturb him [music] well friend show me mir [ music] please give me I have heard that you have all the medicines I want to call you will fun me like this [ music] hey and the blind people of tomorrow go and talk get up [music] get up khaala hello how am I calling khaala see I don't have much time don't disconnect the phone listen to me carefully khaala I cannot stay for long I am telling you get me out of here as soon as possible khaala otherwise no one will be worse than me and then give him a tough time so that he proves my video wrong just see khaala if I don't get trapped  Then I will never leave you trapped with me Are you listening, sell your house, sell your savings, sell yourself I don't know anything, just tell that lawyer that my love get me [ __ ] out of this jail Hey, do you have any shame or have you lost everything in the gamble, whom are you threatening, you have no shame left, I am yours, have you forgotten yours or do you think that I am the same person who goes around robbing with you, yes, no, and whom are you talking about trapping, you will get trapped, suffer my shoes, whatever you have done, will you suffer it all your life, will you rot in jail, that too on my testimony, look aunt, stop this dramabaazi and get me out of here, I need you at this time, I am doing what you deserve, people say it's right, one should not expect loyalty from other's children, and listen to me carefully, next time if you call on my number, then I will come to the jail and beat you with such shoes that your face will be glued, bring your respect, I do n't know what you think of yourself  You have ruined me and this house, to whom will I show my face? Will you call the whole of Pakistan? La la has hurt me. [Praise] To shut her mouth, today I have come from your home. Today I have got this gift. Thank God a million times. Today her second daughter will also become our Raki. Papa Veer will become a part of his home. But until Mama herself opens the doors of that house for Momina, I and Momin will not return to that house. It is not like that, son Atul. She is not the same. Understand. It is right that she will never reveal it to you. But now she wants from her heart that you and Mamina come back. Why don't I feel so? Hey friend, believe me, why don't you say this looking into my eyes? You should only talk to Momina looking into my eyes. Understand, I understand what you are saying. By staying with you, she has also become clever. You said it absolutely right. [Music] Well, son, all the preparations are complete. Yes, Baba. Of course, I had talked to Faiz for the marriage.  We will do the rituals today itself. Okay Baba, there are tears in your eyes. I am very happy Abir. I always wanted such a function. Today, everything has been possible only because of you. I am not able to understand how to thank you. If I were your father, I would thank him as well. [ Sangeet] I have to thank him as well. [Sangeet] I have to thank him. [Sangeet] I have to thank God. What are you doing? Your makeup will get ruined. I love you. Because of this, I wanted to tell Afan uncle and Aram bhai about it. Now, it didn't seem good to say it openly in front of them. Makkal has fulfilled her duty of friendship to Baba. And Arham bhai has fallen in love with you. Brother, I don't know when I will see that day when I will make you my bride and live with Aram bhai. And when will the world between you two end? What happened? Veer, how many times will I have to leave? And anyway, it is a relationship of the heart between me and Aram, I don't care about it.  But it would have mattered to Arham bhai, he needs not just your love but also your company. Just promise me that from today onwards this room is for both of you. From now onwards make Sami sleep with Femi aunty. Brother, your life should also begin, Veer and he have come here only for your wedding and that is why I had come here. It is not right for them to stay here and I also don't want that they can afford a separate house for you and you. You will have to go with them. There is no time for all these other things. So many things. Okay, listen, once you get married, you settle down in your house. Then I will see, then I will think. [Music] Okay, hey bhai, someone please look at us too. We are ready. You are looking very sweet. Masha, why right now? Okay, listen, I have put Sami to sleep after getting him ready. The guests have come downstairs. Please come quickly. You guys have done very well. I was also thinking of seeing him. How long will it take? I am ready. So, please pay attention to what you said. Okay, just make your mood good.
