[6.32] Sajna
[13.85] [Music]
[27.56] Sajna I am sorry, she fell asleep brother, no problem, take rest, her
[31.68] drip is
[35.84] over, I thought to remove the drip, well
[47.04] done, my duty timings were over,
[49.64] then I thought I should go and meet her, I do
[51.40] n't know how she will be then, thank you very much, by
[53.96] the way, you know Zeba used to
[55.84] live in my neighborhood before her marriage, she told me
[58.56] that your wife has passed away, I
[64.28] want to know, by the way, you are a man of great courage, you are
[68.48] raising a premature baby, that too
[70.68] without a mother, Allah has given you courage,
[73.52] when something falls on your head, Allah
[76.40] makes some way or the other,
[78.20] just pray that you don't have to
[80.88] come to this hospital again,
[84.76] I did not get much happiness from here,
[88.84] Insha Allah it will be like this, by the way, I am
[92.28] feeling good now, much better, but
[95.92] still I will tell you to
[97.40] definitely show her to a specialist tomorrow,
[100.16] how are you Bemi, brother, you took out the time,
[103.96] thank you very much,
[106.88] no, let's go tomorrow, we will meet, take care of yourself,
[109.88] and if there is any problem, please come out to the nurse
[112.36] school, thank you very much,
[118.84] Shami
[121.40] baby, how will you be  Are
[126.84] you feeling well now? Okay, I understand that he is your child.
[131.30] [Music] He is a
[132.92] gift from Allah.
[135.48] Look, sister, I am not a woman who works from house to house. I have
[139.72] three small children of my own. If
[142.48] fate is bad, I have to
[147.40] work. Then you will leave your child
[149.52] here. You will have to stay here for a long time. I will
[155.84] leave him with my mother-in-law.
[160.20] My poor husband used to set up a vegetable cart.
[165.40] One day there was an explosion and I, the unfortunate one, did
[170.36] not even get to see his face. I had
[172.88] heard that the government would help, but
[177.24] till date we have not seen any help. The
[180.48] government only talks, it does not
[182.72] help. This helplessness has
[187.12] brought me to your door. I will take complete care of your brother.
[190.72] You can be completely carefree about him. I
[197.28] cannot stay late at night, but I will come early in the morning. I will take
[201.04] full 1000
[203.88] rupees. I will do all the work of your child.
[207.08] Wash his clothes, bathe him, wash him,
[211.04] everything. Okay, tell me, do you have a phone?
[213.80] Actually, I want Baba to come,
[217.08] then I will talk to him and then I will
[219.04] tell you.  You give me your number, I will
[221.72] talk to Baba and let you know, you can call
[224.36] me on this number, it is
[227.72] possible that some means can be created for me,
[231.00] okay, you
[238.68] go, the
[240.32] means can be created for you
[242.44] because our Baba is
[244.88] ready to do anything for his son,
[246.68] you see, Aadhi is hiring a 12 year old maid for her son
[250.88] and a
[253.16] simple aunt for Ammi, Baba had a problem with the
[256.72] maid, Ammi had a problem with Baba, don't be
[265.24] so proud, if you sleep so much,
[269.92] life will become difficult,
[272.40] life has already become very difficult,
[275.28] what will be more difficult than this
[281.04] [Sangeet],
[288.08] what should I do now with this girl
[291.57] [Sangeet], I
[382.36] salute your courage, she stays awake here the whole night
[385.28] and then leaves for her clinic job early, what should I do,
[391.80] what should I say, while hiding the light of my eyes,
[396.32] even sleep has hidden somewhere from
[400.92] me, now the day I get off from work, I
[404.20] spend the whole night awake, today I am
[407.44] going to some sister's house or the market, I am thinking of
[411.08] going to the market, come see, she
[413.56] brought my dupatta  G It has become very old
[416.12] my Amma does not recognize the dupatta I
[418.64] just have to bring the dupatta Nothing else of yours I just had to bring the
[420.92] dupatta ok ok if you remember anything then
[423.08] message me and yes listen the
[425.36] patient in front is very unwell

[431.72] up

[462.16] thing I will drop you sitting here no no

[478.32] f
[486.96] Amma
[488.96] yes I am going towards Abir there is no
[493.16] need to go there she is an ill mannered and bad
[496.20] minded girl it is better to stay away from her
[498.44] and anyway you will not find anyone good in her company if
[502.92] you did not have the compulsion of a mother's child then I
[505.52] swear I would not have even turned back to that house
[511.80] see
[512.76] Abrar bring me into life  There are ups and downs
[516.40] but they should not affect our relationship If
[520.72] you were in the hospital you could have at least called me I would have come
[524.72] friend you could have sent me at
[527.72] least you could have done this much You have done a
[531.28] lot of favour to me
[533.44] friend I am incapable of repaying her debt
[537.76] Just pray for me friend After Shagufta's departure my
[544.28] life has turned upside down I am
[549.36] unable to understand what to
[552.00] do and
[555.64] I have been wanting to talk to you for a long time
[559.56] but I was unable to gather courage
[563.48] Look you have to come out of the grief of Shagufta now
[567.40] Look your children don't
[572.48] need only your company you have to do a lot more for them
[575.44] and I heard that you have taken a long leave from the office
[578.08] what will happen by taking that leave
[580.16] brother after all you will have to go back
[582.16] how will this
[588.72] work [Sangeet] You are listening to this voice that is
[592.32] why you did
[594.84] not even let me grieve for Shagufta
[601.04] just now
[607.28] [Sangeet]
[612.24] came Do you know
[616.24] Jeba when people say such things that a woman
[620.48] waits for a man
[622.88] waits for him dresses up for him
[629.60] and her whole life is for him
[633.64] All these things seem very bookish to me. I do
[639.80] n't trust them. So listen, no
[644.96] one has ever looked at you in this way.
[647.12] Hey, your job is to
[650.44] sit with men day and night.
[652.23] [Sangeet]
[655.12] Get up. Maybe that's why till date no man's
[659.12] eyes have ever rested
[661.16] on me. Men like women covered up in burqas.
[670.00] But you know Jeeva, if a man's
[675.20] eyes had rested on me, not only would I have made
[678.16] his heart but also his home prosperous. It would have been great
[682.56] fun. I have not one but four children
[685.44] running here and there. Wow, what a
[688.20] life I would have had.
[689.88] You would have spent your mountain-like life
[693.52] raising your sister's children.
[695.49] [Sangeet] There is
[698.32] still time,
[701.92] start thinking about yourself. These people have
[705.24] put you on a pedestal not just because of your earnings.
[707.80] Stop giving up now. They will lift you from their heads and
[710.32] throw you on the ground and then wo
[713.00] n't even look back.
[714.75] [Sangeet]
[717.96] People are right.
[720.64] I know all these things.
[723.40] But what should I
[726.00] do? When I think about myself, I get
[729.48] very depressed.
[734.20] Time stops. It does
[739.96] n't pass at all. That's why.  I do two jobs so that
[744.04] neither my body goes there nor my
[747.88] heart is sad.
[750.36] Listen
[754.08] Femi one thing has just come to my mind, you should
[759.08] think carefully, see, Allah gives signals to his servants.
[764.52] Abrar Bhai is a very good man.
[769.20] I had told him the same thing a few days back that Abrar
[771.64] Bhai does not need an understanding woman for your house
[774.04] and the same thing I am telling you today,
[777.84] you will get an understanding man like Abrar Bhai, you will get a
[781.44] ready-made house, your life will be made better.
[785.24] Hey, have you gone mad Jeba, should I get
[787.88] married? Why should I get married? Should I
[790.40] lose my freedom? Why is she very dear to me
[792.76] brother? I cannot lose her. And look
[795.84] brother, if the marriage had happened at the right time, then I would have got married
[798.08] by now, I would have taken care of everything at home,
[800.40] now I cannot do that. You did
[803.72] not bring me up for no reason, so consider me a sister or a
[807.24] friend. No matter what the age of a woman is, freedom
[811.68] becomes a cause of disgrace for her. See, get
[815.36] married and settle down, your days and nights will be peaceful.
[820.76] Then you will like the house as well as the
[825.00] comfort of home. Jeba, think for yourself, use your wisdom, those two
[829.84] young daughters.  Who is his father brother, why would he
[832.20] marry me? The wings of a surkhab have put me under,
[834.20] why would he do that,
[835.84] crazy man? Leave it all to me,
[839.48] you calm down and decide after thinking carefully
[842.56] Apara is very good,
[847.20] he had always kept Shagufta happy, his two daughters will
[851.08] also get married, and as for the son, he will
[855.32] always be with you,
[857.48] Pami think about it

[947.04] You Hello, where are you, have you seen the time?
[951.48] What time is it? It's so late.
[953.48] You know that if you get even a little late, I get
[956.08] so upset.
[957.52] Why haven't you come home yet? Now I'm
[959.40] so sorry Aapi, I was going to call you only.
[961.32] Actually, after college, Kiran's
[963.64] birthday was planned. Birthday party at home.
[966.28] Yes, she was giving a treat, so we
[968.52] all came to her house.
[970.48] Abhir, you could have at least told me
[973.52] where you were going, whose house you were going to, you just went with your
[976.44] head held high, what has happened to anyone's house,
[979.24] why are you talking like this,
[981.20] and anyway, I have come out after so many days,
[984.84] I was
[986.16] going from home to Delhi to come back home, that's why you came to
[989.36] Kiran's house, now put the phone down and let
[993.48] me relax a little
[994.64] [Music]
[1007.72] [Music] It's
[1015.52] late, baby, baby is here
[1027.28] [Music]
[1037.78] [Music]
[1045.52] No, Abhira Bhai, what time is this, thank you for coming from college, do
[1055.76] you remember anything other than this child,
[1060.16] Kabir's college time, his not
[1065.28] coming home, you at least remembered that we both are
[1069.40] also your daughters, how can I forget
[1072.20] my daughters
[1075.84] who see the spectacle of my helplessness,
[1079.64] but don't like to pick up this innocent child in their lap,
[1083.28] as if it is a crime
[1115.21] [Music]
[1129.49] [Music]
[1137.32] My sister,
[1139.44] crying is in her fate, let her
[1142.96] cry, it would be better if you don't talk to me at this time
[1147.95] [Music]
[1153.27] [Prashasa]
[1154.58] [Music]
[1160.72] Oh
[1163.16] ho Shami Shami, look what your Baba has brought
[1168.28] [Prashansa] If she were
[1171.64] your mother, she would have done everything for
[1174.64] you
[1176.36] baby, see, if she were your mother,
[1181.36] she would have done all this, look, Baba has brought me a mother
[1185.64] for you, he doesn't cry
[1190.00] and keeps crying the whole day, I have asked Azar brother to bring
[1199.72] another mother for him, if he can, he won't be able to find peace without a mother, the
[1203.80] only difference is that you do
[1207.00] n't see my tears but I can hear his voice,
[1216.92] you are right, I have run out of words to explain myself,
[1223.20] I had heard
[1225.92] that elder sisters are equal to mothers,
[1230.76] what kind of a sister are you, this poor guy keeps
[1234.56] crying, keeps suffering and you never even
[1237.04] look back at him, oh that
[1239.68] Abira is young, she is still naive, she doesn't understand,
[1242.12] Abira doesn't understand, Baba, she is the
[1245.24] most sensitive among us, she is Ammi's favourite,
[1248.48] you know she has now started looking for ways to escape from this house,
[1252.56] today she had gone to one of her
[1255.56] friend's house because she does
[1258.52] n't feel like staying in this house, oh what should I do, how can I make
[1260.92] you both happy,
[1262.68] I was not so lonely even
[1265.36] when the earthquake happened  All my loved ones are dead
[1270.41] [Music]
[1271.92] Your mother did not do well to me,
[1275.40] he is not even able to breathe properly, she has
[1279.44] handed him over to me. I do
[1284.16] not know how to raise children. What should I do?
[1286.48] It was your own decision.
[1289.00] You wanted a son and mother wants your
[1292.28] happiness. It is not just my son, you have a
[1296.28] brother too. What should I do? What should I do with this brother? He is the
[1300.36] brother because of whom our mother is not with us.
[1303.44] You will bring another mother for him.
[1307.16] What will
[1308.52] happen to us? Our mother will never come back. Never

[1436.88] y aleikum Abra Sahab, I was just thinking about you,
[1442.64] yes, you will reach there at 4:00.
[1446.36] Don't worry at all,

[1466.80] Ungiyard
[1470.61] [Music]
[1484.92] Momna yaar, what's the problem with you
[1487.40] and we have been searching for you there for a long time.  And you are
[1489.40] sitting here, I will call him and he will come
[1491.56] here, no don't call me, I have to go to the book store
[1494.84] quickly ma'am, so you go with him,
[1497.76] he has been looking for you for so long, he was
[1499.64] worried about what has
[1502.40] happened to you, he should know something, he
[1506.32] keeps looking for you, you keep hiding from him,
[1508.48] you both start playing a strange game of hide and seek, the
[1512.08] game ends even before it starts,
[1517.40] tell him, why will I tell you,
[1520.72] you tell yourself,
[1525.72] Raj sahab,
[1528.40] becoming a father and being called a father is very easy,
[1531.00] but all the difficulties come to the mother's share
[1532.80] and the cruelty is that no
[1535.96] one can understand her difficulties, but
[1538.32] your courage is saluted, you
[1541.36] are the mother of this child as well as the father, I am
[1544.20] thankful to Allah that he made me
[1545.92] capable of taking responsibility for him,
[1547.76] otherwise I was not capable of this, yes you are right,
[1552.28] but see how patient the child is, he did
[1555.96] not even cry, maybe Allah gives patience to children without a mother, and
[1564.20] after this injection he will have fever and
[1566.76] pain too, so maybe he will cry a little  So
[1569.64] if his health is very bad then this is the medicine,
[1572.28] give him half a spoon of each.
[1575.88] If he has a high fever. Okay,
[1579.24] thank you very much doctor, because of you very important
[1582.32] work has been done, otherwise I did not remember
[1584.80] that he also needs to get vaccinated. You are a little
[1587.92] late, but it doesn't matter.
[1590.00] Look, I have made a card. Whenever you get his
[1592.20] vaccination done, get it entered in this card.
[1594.28] Okay, this way you will
[1596.60] remember it, now you will remember it completely. Now I cannot
[1599.56] forget and anyway
[1601.88] we will come to Aapi for vaccination. It is okay that Sami has got used to your hands,
[1604.72] but you should
[1608.16] not spoil your habits. This clinic is
[1611.20] very far from your house. There is
[1614.00] any small clinic near your house, you
[1615.84] can get the injection from there.
[1621.96] Thank you very much Avraj sahab, if you have any problem, then
[1625.56] call me. Thank you very much.
[1627.72] Better, very much
[1629.09] [Music]
[1632.44] Doubt yes, show me what happened. I agree that for
[1636.76] some days nothing was right between me and Mamna.
[1640.72] Okay, my Mamna's thinking is of the 20th century,
[1643.80] but somewhere she is right and I like
[1646.64] her thinking.  It doesn't matter to her. Momina and I have spent our lives together and she is
[1650.88] not ready to understand that. She is a stupid girl. This is a
[1655.16] very serious problem. I thought there was
[1657.72] some misunderstanding between you two,
[1659.28] but here the whole family is
[1661.84] evolved and it is very difficult to make our emotional
[1664.76] mothers understand. So
[1667.44] I
[1669.16] am ready to do this difficult task. I have fought for her before also and I will
[1672.24] fight in the future too. At least she should
[1674.80] support me. I had stopped her,
[1677.60] tried a lot to make her understand but she doesn't listen. She is
[1679.96] very stubborn. And you know
[1684.04] what she said before leaving.
[1686.64] She said that some games
[1691.48] end even before they begin.
[1693.96] [Sangeet]
[1700.88] She is talking about the game.
[1703.64] In this, not only one person loses.
[1709.60] Both of them lose,
[1712.64] life and
[1716.12] happiness. You tell her that if I become adamant, she will
[1720.12] sit and cry all her life. [
[1727.96] Sangeet]
[1736.40] And
[1746.00] you, who are you? Your praise, I have
[1750.04] got an appointment here. I got the appointment.
[1754.22] [Music]
[1766.32] You
[1769.97] [Music]
[1776.36] Abrar sahab, you have to raise your voice against injustice.
[1780.52] Appointing someone else in your place is
[1783.72] sheer injustice.
[1785.36] These people have taken advantage of your helplessness.
[1789.84] People come to us with their issues
[1793.00] and the cruelty is that to whom should we take our complaint? After
[1798.12] hearing my complaint, people
[1800.24] look at me as if I am lying. Now
[1803.04] who should explain to them that okay, it was
[1806.88] my wish to have a child, but it is Allah's wish, is
[1810.80] n't it? Abrar sahab, how is your son?
[1813.92] Seeing his condition, I could not believe that he will
[1815.56] survive so soon. May Allah give you
[1817.96] courage. You have shown by becoming a mother. May Allah
[1820.84] give him a long life.
[1823.84] Amen. Pray for a long life with good health.
[1826.68] Rest, he will get whatever is destined for him.
[1830.44] For now, try to make his fate. If you
[1833.16] have a job, his needs will be
[1837.32] fulfilled. You should
[1840.64] make a separate arrangement for a nanny etc. for him. And yes, your daughters are
[1843.88] also very intelligent. You should hand him over to them
[1846.20] and you should take care of your seat.
[1848.80] Now if you get a seat, it is fine. Here, the
[1851.92] situation changes every hour.  Yes sir, I had
[1854.24] also told you that these mistresses are not friends of anyone, but
[1858.36] after the death of your wife, you disappeared from here as if it was
[1861.52] not your wife, but for God's sake, you
[1864.56] left this world. Sir, you should take Pachaar sahab to your aid
[1870.07] [sangeet] It
[1878.32] was a good joke, at this age you should have children,
[1882.84] that too of someone else. Apara Bhai
[1886.48] took too much advantage of Murat
[1888.24] and this Kausar, she has also not come yet. I will throw
[1892.60] her out of the house standing.
[1894.80] What is the use of such a maid who is
[1898.28] not even aware of her child. It is a
[1899.40] problem. Where is my
[1904.96] phone?
[1911.08] Hello, brother, if you had to go to office,
[1916.20] you should have at least stopped Abir. Neither
[1920.72] your daughters are capable of anything, nor your maid.
[1926.12] What are you paying salary for? She
[1929.88] sits after taking leave everyday, look Apara
[1933.24] Bhai, I also have 100 household works to do.
[1936.44] I have been sitting since long with Sami in my lap
[1939.98] [sangeet]
[1945.48] Sorry sir, it is
[1947.84] very important to go to college from home. Maybe this
[1950.88] job does not hold much importance for you,
[1953.44] but it is
[1956.08] not possible for us to keep the seat vacant for long.
[1958.92] I had to take this decision in favour of the company.
[1961.92] Sir, you are talking about the job which supports my family.
[1965.44] Why would I not give importance to it?
[1967.72] Sir, this file is asking me to resign.
[1973.28] Imran sahab, this file has been
[1977.60] prepared on the instructions of Chairman sahab and whether to
[1980.88] keep you in the company or not is the decision of Chairman sahab.
[1983.08] This is wrong sir. I had
[1986.24] told him about my compulsion. My wife has passed away.
[1990.08] My
[1992.28] child was in the hospital. Your child was in the ICU. I
[1997.36] mean a small
[2000.84] child.
[2002.56] My wife died on his birth.
[2008.36] Sir, I have given 15 years to this firm.
[2012.96] How can you do this injustice to me?
[2015.56] Ibrar sahab, I am not doing anything wrong with you.
[2017.96] I am just telling you the decision of the company.
[2020.64] If you want, you
[2022.84] can meet Chairman sahab in this regard. I am just
[2026.00] doing what I have been told.
[2027.61] [Music]
[2034.92] Sir, thank you sir. Thank you
[2039.52] [Music] [
[2047.81] Music]
[2062.72] [Music]
[2104.12] We will all go. Baba is tired. Let him rest.
[2107.20] You both go and put him to sleep. Good
[2109.84] night Baba. Good
[2112.30] [Music]
[2118.36] Night Assalam  Walekum sahab ji, I have put the
[2123.08] child to sleep. I was taking
[2126.40] him for a walk since morning but he was crying a lot. I
[2128.92] feel he is having pain in his stomach.
[2130.80] You should show him to a doctor. He is
[2133.88] not having pain in his stomach. Don't
[2137.20] make up stories on your own.
[2141.12] Understood? Hello baby.
[2144.64] Hello. Who applied kajal in his eyes?
[2148.28] Who told you to
[2150.32] apply kajal in his eyes? Have
[2152.76] you gone crazy? Hey, grown up women apply it
[2154.96] in their eyes. You applied it in the child's eyes. It was
[2157.76] kept on the dressing table inside, so I
[2160.08] applied it. Applying kajal in children's eyes does not make
[2162.48] their eyes big.
[2164.44] They do not become big. It is harmful.
[2167.32] You also should not apply it in your children's eyes. Do
[2169.40] n't go mad. I am
[2173.08] fooling you for no reason. Its eyes are open.
[2176.72] Milk has spilled. You don't do your work carefully
[2178.92] and you keep on applying kajal.
[2180.96] Or you keep on watching TV.
[2185.72] Go, go and see who has
[2192.24] come outside. Oh my son, go,
[2196.68] you have ruined all your eyes. You have
[2202.00] applied all the kajal, friend. This is very  She is a
[2206.44] crazy girl, come clean it, I do
[2212.24] n't know who put it on it, it didn't come off, hey hey
[2218.20] what are you doing
