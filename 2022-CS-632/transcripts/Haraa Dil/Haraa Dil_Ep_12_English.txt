Lose heart Sajna Lose heart Sajna Sajna friend I have got married I have not committed any crime Nobody supported me in my compulsion And now whoever is getting the chance is cursing me I have no objection to your second marriage But you should have at least talked to me And if you had asked me then I would have found some such a noble and educated lady for you who would have been suitable for you You have crossed all limits don Please I am very sorry Barar I am sorry I have always helped you I have supported you in everything If you had shared it with me here then I would have advised you to marry this woman I have met her once But many times one glance is enough to know someone's family and character I do not agree with you at all On listening to Atul Bhabhi's words I started doubting even her family background Today you will see [Sangeet] Amatula Relationships do not change with change of circumstances But change of glance in relationships  What do you mean, which relationship has cracked? I don't make any profit. I can never give your wife the status that Shagufta Bhabhi had in my eyes. But I never gave her the status of Shagufta. Whatever I have done, I have done it out of helplessness. Sameer would have cried. Sometimes I would have worked in this house, sometimes in that house, or would have taken care of it. Then I also got the girls married. I am not so selfish that I would keep them tied to the house for my happiness. But this matter should end here. Afan [Music] Afan. Whatever I did, I did it for your welfare. But you all are unique daughters of the world. You are not happy under any circumstances. Your father's house is getting settled. This child is getting the support of his mother. You should have thanked me. What benefit did I give you and do you want to take commission from Abrar Bhai? With a lot of apologies, aunty, that friend of yours, she herself behaves like a 16-year-old girl. And how did you get such a small amount of money from me?  She seems to be the mother of the child. Neither is she 16 years old nor is her behavior, she is a very sensible nurse and moreover she is in your father's marriage. Now both of you give her a place in this house with respect otherwise your mother's upbringing will be tarnished. Nothing will happen to me and neither is her place in the house given with respect to the one who is worthy of this respect. First she came to our house with you and then started following our Baba. Maybe this was his intention from the beginning. Repent, do n't blame anyone like this. Use your mind and hand over the house and everything to her and you people finish your studies. Tomorrow you have to get married and leave this house. You people have to please aunty don't worry about us. We don't need anyone. Everything will be fine. You will see to it. And yes, I cannot tolerate the presence of any other woman in this house in place of my mother. Please explain this to your friend also. Only Allah can guide you people. I refrain from speaking in anyone's matter. Such stubborn and harsh girls, how can they do that? I am surprised at what could happen [Sangeet] He has no other work right now Please bring something for him Don't be quiet [Sangeet] I am [Sangeet] Look I have packed all my stuff I thought when you come now that the matter has been revealed I will go home with you Oh Allah I know I went to the parlor too I have come ready Otherwise your eyes would not have fallen on me I thought if you get ready a little better then maybe you will look at me You look very good even in Saki Also leave it ok Tell me all my stuff will come to your house There is space right I have given a lot of stuff to the junk but I have to take some amount with me The truth is that now I do n't feel like staying in this house I just want to stay with you Famida I cannot take you with me right now You will have to stay here for a few more days What do you mean you will not take me to your house Allah look tell me the truth have you thought of leaving me or not Zeba was right in saying about her daughters stubbornness  You would have been swept away like a straw in front of me. Will my desire to settle down in the village remain in my heart? But I have not said so. You assume wrongly about yourself. Try to understand the delicacy of the situation. This is also your house. Your circumstances will always be delicate. But what will happen to me? Have you ever thought? I am also a human being. I also have to face four people. What answer will I give to whom and you are like this. I feel that you are regretting getting married. Just don't talk uselessly. You see, many times things get spoiled in haste. You should be a little patient. And this month, I will also pay the rent of this house. You don't worry at all. There is no need for you to do me a favor. I need money. I am greedy. I cannot take care of myself. There is no need for me to do you a favor. I have been running this house for so long. I will run it further too. If your daughters don't want to see you happy, then what should I do? See, I will take care of whatever I have done.  Do n't worry at all, I will not serve you tea in anger today [Music] Now you, I will unpack the luggage for your tea Well, the luggage has to be unpacked right [Music] I will sit [Music] Now will our brother's father stay with his new bride? What useless things are you talking about Aabi? Let me put him to sleep. He is feeling restless since morning. Poor guy, a strange chemistry has developed between us. If I get upset, he too doesn't get any peace. It is a good misunderstanding. And what wrong thing have I said? I am saying the right thing, brother. Since we have got married, we will stay together. Find out if you have planned a honeymoon Aabi. What nonsense is this? Please Aabi, don't say such things even in jest. I feel very sad. Yes, I feel very happy [Music] No Aabi, we are going on a Pakistan tour. Today the date has been confirmed, so I am excited. It will be a lot of fun. I will be free from this house and the atmosphere here. What do you mean by going? How are you going like this? It is obvious that there are plans for college, it is necessary to go. Have you asked Baba, Baba, which one?  They do their work after asking me. Whatever I ask them, Aabi, there is no comparison between you and Baba and our relationship does not even deserve a competition. Seriously, Aabi, you still care about our relationship. You are very innocent and one day your innocence will harm you a lot. Remember my words. Yes, if there was some work, you could have called me. I have come to talk to you about something very important. Beta, Jiji said, look, it was my heartfelt desire that Momina becomes the daughter-in-law of this house. I wanted you to get a chance to fulfill all the happiness of your life. But beta, I regret to say that I will not be able to fulfill this desire of mine. Why, I mean you went to Abrar uncle. He said something. What did you know? But the person I met [Sangeet] can never be Momina's father. He was the husband of a very hot-tempered woman. I was not against her marriage, rather I was in her favor. Her marriage was necessary. But I did not know that she was going to marry him.  Getting entangled in this affair, he will even forget the respect for our relationship [Music] I do n't know Baba, I only know that Arar uncle did not do the right thing, he did not think about anyone, neither Veer, nor Momina, I do n't know what happened to him [Music] [ Music] Now will I have to go to a hotel for breakfast and lunch [Music] I feel very happy when my daughters, who are dearer to me, do a favor to me [Music] Hello, yes, yes, tell me, is it such a big thing, Ra is telling me now, I am coming, I am coming [Music] Thieves had come to Sami's mother's house, there has been a fight as well, she is in the hospital [Music] [Praise] [Music] [Praise] [Music] Come, come, I am not able to go slowly, hey Momina, how are you, give me some support and take me inside, come, Abraj sahab, I am not able to stand at all, so yes, enough [Music] enough [Music] Come on, what have you done Baba, I told you that no one can take Ammi's place, why did you bring her here  Take her away ok son let's sit and talk look at her condition where will I take her in this condition and anyway this is my responsibility and if we look at it then she is your mother by my relation our mother is dead nobody can take her place you should go from here please take her away from here Abra sahab you have made a mockery of my life I am dying because of the pain I cannot stand on the stairs and should I wait for permission to go inside the house now I have crossed the limit listen Momna look son I have married your baba I am duly in his marriage and I will stay here now if you want you can accept me as your mother or not I will come to this house to fulfil all the responsibilities of becoming your mother you keep quiet keep quiet this baba comes first and after that whatever relation I have with you will happen I am talking to my baba right now understood do n't speak in between never even think that you can become our mother never [Music] only this insult was left to happen Abraaz sahab  If she was not your beloved daughter, I would have replied to her words carefully. Look, I appreciate your wisdom. Shagufta has brought her up with great love and care. The wound is still fresh. Slowly everything will be healed. Bringing up with pampering and tantrums does not mean, Abraaj sahab, that the child becomes arrogant and forgets to respect his father. And your child, I also feel something. My head is hurting so much. I feel like it will burst any moment. Listen, please call Jeba and tell her to make a nice soup. Some soup so that it brings some life back to my body. I am capable of taking up the responsibilities of this house. I am fine. And yes, he will also bring some essential things from the house. As much as you want, don't bring much. Just bring the essential things. The house will be filled unnecessarily. I think everything is present here. Well, it's fine, right? Don't stress your mind right now. You will feel more pain. Take rest. Everything will be fine now. Insha Allah. Yes, I will take care of that anyway. [Music] I am yes, I will bring water.  I will bring water for you [Music] How can I tell you [Music] Come [Music] [ Music] Rabi, you come home quickly [Music] Please nothing has happened, just come home [Music] Go [Music] You have gone mad, what are you doing, are you mad? Your mother did not teach you manners, she let you respect her by putting it on your face, you are like this, unfortunately I am like this and if my mother had taught me manners, then how would a lady like you change that? Now keep quiet, otherwise no one will be worse than me, I am quiet, baba, but let me tell you one thing and that is that if you wake up this aunty in my mother's room, then I will burn this house to ashes and you know very well that I can do that, what is the use and in this way you will only get yourself and mother insulted, baba, but I have a request for you, let her stay in the guest room only, please do not take her to mother's room [Music] Please go, this is your issue, you are very  You give up so easily It is better to be a human being than making a scene [praise] Ever since Ammi passed away Abir, our house has become a scene People tell stories about our house, make a scene and make fun of us [music] I don't want this [music] Ar [music] your clothes have become wet, change them today Bismillah Oh wow Araj sahab, what a radiant face she has, by the way, I started feeling like she's mine from the first day itself Now she is yours, you have to take care of her more than yourself Consider her as my life in her You don't need to say all this, just tell me where her things are so that I can prepare for her By the way, there is one thing Abraaj sahab, it's a big injustice The best and most beautiful room in the house is occupied by your daughters By the way, how did you give birth to such cruel girls? Look, it will take some time for you to understand them and for them to accept you But I promise you that you won't demand your rights In this house, I have given you the position of Sami's mother Please take care of her  Please save his honour, do n't worry about him at all Hey, he is getting restless I think he is feeling sleepy, please tell Momna to prepare milk for him [Sangeet] It is time for him to sleep, I will put him to sleep Abraj saheb, I do n't like taunting when it comes to this child, from now on this child will stay here, sleep here, he will get used to it, you explain to Momna in your own language, you have brought me to this house as the mother of this child, and the reason for which you married me, made me your wife, I will complete that work [Sangeet] na [Sangeet] [Sangeet] [Sangeet] I forgot that you have brought a new mother for him, from today my work and my duty is over [Sangeet] [Sangeet] b bash make him quiet, see how he is quiet, come on, we will prepare milk for our child ourselves aa aa [Sangeet] child hello yes I wanted to ask you that you are going to Fariya's wedding, right, take me along too I couldn't go to the mehandi, but today I will definitely go to the wedding Sami yes Sami's  New mother has come so my responsibility ends from today [Music] Okay, Khuda [Music] Hafiz, hi handsome, why do you remain so non-serious all the time brother, because I have come in this world to enjoy, not to get bored like you, tell me one thing, don't you get bored by making such a serious face all the time?

Aunty told me that you are going to a friend's wedding. I am very fond of watching Pakistani weddings. I couldn't get a better opportunity than this. So we are going. Listen, listen, only I got the invitation for it. I am going alone, right, so what's the big deal in this, whether you get the invitation or I, the thing is the same [Music] No, wow, what a fragrance taste it turned out quite good, Janaab, I will talk to Mama, there is no one at home, yes, I mean, Aunty has gone somewhere with Aj, that's why she told me that I  I would go with you if I get very bored then by the way when I do n't have any issue in going with you then why are you worrying so much why don't you find a permanent solution to your boredom when are you going back right now I am not going here only ok listen all these things will be discussed later your handkerchief ok you get ready I will bring a look [music] good [music] look how are you looking na yes Momna I wanted to talk to you about something who is this with Arham you should have principles with him right then has there been any fight between you two what's the issue friend what is this your scene turns on and then turns off why have you both made your relationship so complicated things have become so complicated Nana that now if any difficulty comes it doesn't matter this time will also pass why will this time pass Mamna if you want you can take this time in your hands and I am a good boy Momna he loves you please do these small things [Music] If there were no misunderstandings, I would have gone away [Music] [Music] [Praise] [Music] What a life it was, full of bad habits, but this is what I have learnt, serve your husband, then you get happiness in this world and you are getting peace in the end too, right? Then press your legs comfortably [ Music] go [Music] come on come on come on come on, I will cook food for Sami, then Bheena Sammi Gudda will eat and will grow up. Hey brother, is there anyone in this house, give me breakfast, Momna brother, your father has also woken up, oh Allah, Momna, I have heard that you make very good tea, give it to me, Sami, he is talking to me, he himself has a habit of speaking, hey Momna, please cook breakfast quickly, listen, this order is for you only, brother, now get up, go and make tea for your new mother, if you do n't do this, then you will be guilty, how can you do this kind of drama, you have got a free nanny, you should not treat them as a person, you should know your importance in your life, you should shut up, are you aware that Sami  Where is he since last night and in what condition is he? These are the days when he is losing his senses. I am talking about him, why am I not aware now that Sam is with his elder sister and an elder sister is like a mother, why do I need to worry? If I did not have to raise and take care of the elder sister, then what was the need for Mal to come? That is the way to go out of the house. Not me but you both will go out of the house [Music]
