Amtula aunty knowingly called her to her house and insulted her in front of everyone. She knew that Amma would not be able to bear this shock and in this condition this shock can also take her life. This was not a coincidence, this was a well thought out plan. You have gone mad, what are you saying to me Mamna, it is nothing like this, it is like this. What did I do, what did I spoil, what did I do to them, in revenge for which they have snatched my mother from me. How can someone be so ruthless, so cruel and so base? Stop it, whatever Mamna did was all natural, anyone in her place would have done the same. We hid such a big thing from them. Aunty was also at fault [sangeet], why are you saying such things about my Mama? This is not the time, I have just talked and you are feeling so bad. Because of your Mama's words, my mother lost her life [sangeet] and you don't even want to regret. I have come to you only to regret your sorrow.  Happiness is not separate from me, why don't you understand? The one who gives pain, how can he talk about sharing happiness? Please, Ara, I have started hating the name of love itself [Music] Please, Arham Bhai, leave me alone, forgive me and go away from here. You won't understand my pain, and if I tell you the truth, then you will think that I am crossing my limits, so go away from here and just let me be patient. People's pain is not separate from me, why don't you understand? I don't want to understand this, I don't want to understand anything, please go away from here Sajana [Music] [Laughter] [Music] Your mentality can be so conservative that I can't even imagine what world you live in. If a person is medically fit, he can have a child anytime, and what is shameless in this? In the West, marriage at the age of 40, 50 is a common thing. Oh, the thinking and lifestyle of the West does n't apply here. If she was medically fit, she would have died. Why don't you have any thinking of your own or what you are saying?  You are talking about your mother, at least you should go for condolence and all these old grudges should be forgotten on this occasion. I am not friends with her and I don't know how to give condolences etc. If a person dies, so be it, now sit and cry, how stupid is that. One should be practical but not cruel. If you don't have good manners, then don't go, but don't make fun of someone's grief like this [music] Jawar son, that son, I have heard what you said, you are absolutely right, but son, there are some people for whom words of sympathy and consolation fall short. I want to go there myself, but I am unable to understand how I will be able to face Momna's family. Sania has grown up, the mother has gone, the child is in the hospital, but still you should go there, yes, I want to go there, but you all should also come with me, Mama, please, I become very uncomfortable in such gatherings. Please go with Jawar, aunty.  Don't feel bad, it's your fault, had you taught him even one bit of the social values ​​that you believe in, then I would n't have to see this day [Praise] Have you lost your mind? Try to understand the way you were talking to him, otherwise he will go away from you because of your stupid talks. Then keep sitting and talking. Yes, now I am not happy with marrying him. I don't understand how I should try to understand his mood. [ Sangeet] [Sangeet] [Praise] [Sangeet] You know these bangles your Baba got made for me when you were born. [Sangeet] You were the biggest happiness of our lives. Baba didn't have such a good job. I don't know how he got them made. Till date, I ask him this. Baba was very romantic. Make fun of your parents. Yes, look, you do one thing - get matching gems embedded in these bangles with your wedding dress. And yes, I have given a bracelet to be made for Abhir. And son, these are two sets, one is this and the other is this.  It is not that heavy, son. Take it after me. Keep it as a memento of your mother [Music] What do you mean by take it, a memento of your mother? What a strange phrase it is. I don't want any memento of my mother, if I want then it is only my mother always, whether there is happiness or trouble, I don't want anything else, Amma, I only want you always, at every turn of life, you understand, don't you? Son, when we are born, then we get all the years of our life written down. We know the first year of our life but we don't know the last year of our life and only Allah knows it. When all the decisions are taken by Allah, then why do we get angry with each other, what happened to you, why are you saying such things, has Baba said anything? He doesn't say anything now, I keep thinking, may Allah bring back the happiness in my home and also the mischief of you both. Now, I cannot tolerate anyone else in my heart. You are troubled because of us [Music] No, I promise you, I will make everything absolutely fine. Just you be happy [Music] May Allah keep you happy always and may he make you wear these bangles on our heads. [Music] No, you seem as if you were there for me [Music ] [Music] O [Music] [Music] [ Music] Aa [Music] [Praise] S [Praise] I will come I wo n't do anything I just want Aa I told you I only want you I don't want any sign I only want you Ammi just you please come back what will I do for you [Music] [Praise] Without [Music] [Music] She was very hasty in her haste she leaves me alone she has done this to me [Music] Sati and what you did what do you call that [Music] Baba she was in so much pain she had taken so much stress for your happiness you were only engrossed in your own happiness, right Baba you did not look back even once to see in what difficulty, what trouble, what status she was in you did not see I agree son I did a lot of wrong [Music] to her but while she was alive I may have been in the pride of being a father of a son [Music] I must have been knowing her every moment while leaving I could not even give her any happiness your marriage  She left this world with the desire of [Music] c She did not give me a chance to apologize b I don't know how to lighten this burden Father, forgiveness is for a mistake, not for an injustice You have oppressed mother, knowing that she neither has that much courage nor that much strength You have only thought about yourself, only about yourself She left [Music] i [Music] Why have you come here? To see some new drama of ours or to make fun of us or to see what game I should play after mother's death so that both of them also die What nonsense are you talking about? Why do you call your father and sister Qayyum? Do you want to kill them also? Because for you it is not a big deal to trample on someone's happiness or to cry over someone's self-respect I do not understand how Allah created you and sent you to us because you do not have any humanity in you right now aunty this is not right we should leave. Maybe we should not have come here in the first place. The status of you people is only this much that you should be kept at the tip of a shoe, no sympathy, no  Tazi, no relation, you people don't deserve anything, I do n't want your false Tazi because it can't bring my mother back, go away from here [Music] Abir, come to your senses and go inside, go inside, talk about Abir, she is Mamna's future mother-in-law, like your mother, and how do you treat guests who come to the house, you people don't have any control over your tongue, don't say she's not like my mother or like my mother, I do n't know what enmity they have shown with us, how do I control my tongue, how aunty, you should not have come here, you said it absolutely right, I made a mistake, brother, I told you that I have made the biggest mistake of my life by getting into a relationship with these people, okay then correct your mistake however you want, but for God's sake, go away from here right now [Music] please Abir is young and emotional too [Music] I apologize to you on her behalf, we have no complaint against you, no grievance, you people are big people and big people never do wrong, I keep on doing but one thing Listen to me carefully, you even tried to put your father's burden on my head, you wo n't be worse than me. Come on, Jawar [Music] [Music] [Music] [ Music] Come [Music] [Music] Momna, look son, who has come to our house, your brother Veer, come on son, you also see him, he is very weak, the doctors said that he has to be taken care of, son, take care of your mother's last memento, when your mother is no more, what should I do with her memento [Music] Baba, why did you bring him here, why didn't you leave him to die there, I wish he had died instead of ammi, then kill him, far from it, you are talking about something, I have no life for my brother, our brother and congratulations to you, the support of your old age, who took our mother's life [Music] took [ Music] [Music] we [Music] [Music] [Music] why is he crying so much, he will get sick like this [ Music] let him cry, crying is written in his fate, go to sleep, maybe he is feeling hungry, I will go and see, there is no need for him to be hungry  Whatever happens or not, it's not your concern Let Baba see it He was very fond of it, now his fondness is going to be fulfilled Just let me know how easy it is to be a father and how difficult it is to be a mother [Music ] [Music] [Music] [Music] i [Music] [Praise] [Music] What a problem! When will my holidays end and I will be free from this disease [Music] Oye oe oe oe my son Just just just just look, look Baba has come Baba has come No no no don't cry don't cry don't cry come come drink milk Good boy you are a good child, you don't cry, right wa wa wa well done come on come on come drink milk [Music] Look, you have sat down holding my hands and feet as if I am a newly wed bride This is a house of young girls, you don't give me everything Leave me alone Your daughters should be happy that I am serving you I see the swelling in your hands and feet, I feel pain, I can understand how much pain you are in No matter what anyone says brother I am grateful for this service  Do n't stop me from doing this If you get such a protocol after becoming the mother of a son, I would have prayed for this many years ago So is this a reward for the acceptance of your prayers I was thinking that one of my safe files has come up Now no matter whose file it is, what difference does it make How grateful is Allah that he has blessed us with children at this stage of our lives There must be some wisdom of his in this So I think that Momna will get married and go away So this thought makes my heart nervous And then Abhir too will leave this house empty Then it will be you and me and the desolation of this house Look Allah is closest to the heart He has heard what you have not even asked for Just pray that everything goes well Then the empty feeling of this house will turn into little laughter For weeks, I too am yearning for a day Ho Ho Ho When did she go from this house [Sangeet] It seems as if life has also stopped coming and going in my house [Sangeet] Ho
