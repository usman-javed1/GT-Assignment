This is also not a life, it is a wife, it is a woman. It is strange that Mama, so much hatred for Lanti and so much sympathy for Afan uncle, it is compulsion. Sympathy for Afan bhai and lifelong enmity between us, well, leave it, now there is no time for all these things. I think I should talk to Afan bhai right now. Anyway, it has been a long time since I talked to him. Okay Mama, as you wish, but please take care that the present time is not mentioned because I know he will not like it. Don't worry, I will take care and if there is any good news, then definitely tell me. I am sorry Papa, what problem has Mama put you in, why is she doing all this? If I tell you the truth, I have not understood my mother till date. On one hand, she says that she cares for me the most in this world and on the other hand, she does not see my sorrow, my problem, my happiness. Why is she helpless son? Maybe, by her nature, in her eyes, she does not see you.  for me this is their love [music] [music] [praise] be careful be careful [music] whatever you have done to me naram then I will never forgive you for that okay you too can blame me for everything like mama though it doesn't matter to me so even if you do n't forgive me but it does matter to me it does matter to me if someone deceives me cheats me I have not cheated you [music] hey papa you knew everything beforehand angini what will you say to this you married me and married someone else aram this is a great example of wisdom this way I saved my and your life from getting ruined [music] hey life is very short there should not be any scope for regret in it if I had married you and left you after marriage then you would have felt more pain or sorrow why would you have left me after marriage am I that bad you are not bad at all you are very good you deserve a very good life partner who loves you a lot and cares for you I had no such feelings for you no you feeling  You could have also done it If I had done that, I would have been cheating myself Ah, really [Music] [Music] So how are you now beta, how should one feel aunty, I have never felt more rejected and forsaken than this in my life [Music] I have [Music] aunty, you had promised me, did n't you?

You are a very dramatic girl, you have ruined the peace of my house in four days, who taught you all this, you have turned me against my son, you have forced me to take divorce from my husband, how do you do all this with such an innocent face, aunty, why are you talking like this, Allah forbid that the peace of your house is ruined by staying in this house, then this prayer of yours cannot be accepted because either you will stay in this house or I will and I have decided this, now you have to decide who will go first, I had told you that you have no place in my house and in my son's life, but you did not listen to me, you created a drama of your oppressed soul in front of Afa, wow, what an upbringing you have done  Your parents are not ashamed of you I have seen the most shameless people in my life but I have not seen anyone more shameless than you Aunty why are you talking like this I have only asked about uncle's health so now you will tell me when and what should I talk about Aunty please can't you forgive me there is one reason to forgive you tell me he turned my son against me should I forgive you for this my husband was forced to divorce me should I forgive you for this you know you don't you in fact you know very well that everything is happening because of you if you were not in the hospital right now then I would have kicked you out of my house because this is what you deserve [Music] and today we will talk to you what happened why are you crying did you get a call from the hospital but I just spoke to Faraz aunty he is with him uncle is absolutely fine what happened api why are you not telling why are you crying what should I say you pack your stuff pick up Sami we are leaving from here  Sami has just finished his milk and slept. Why are you packing? Are we going somewhere? Yes, we shouldn't have come here. [Music] But Allah can give us a chance to correct our mistakes at any time. Pack your stuff. Okay, I will pack my stuff. But now if anyone should go, it's me and Sami. And why would you leave this house? This is your house. No matter how difficult the situation is, I am not afraid of difficult situations. I am afraid too. I cannot tolerate anyone pointing a finger at the upbringing of my mother and father due to my helplessness and bad luck. What has happened? Is everything alright? Is something alright? Nothing has gone alright. Aunty asked for a divorce. And if uncle gives divorce in anger, then oh, so Atul, aunty is making a drama of her own life. Why do you need to leave your house? It was my home when it was, but this house should not be ruined. There should not be a rift in the relationship between uncle and aunty. People will see the drama of this house and Arham's head will bow down, you know?  What will make Arham Bhai's head bow down when you leave this house? Do you remember, you had promised him that you will stand by him no matter what the circumstances are, it doesn't matter if my promise is broken, then this house should not break. And your house, Aapi, was just a dream, let it break, what difference will it make? [Music] I agree, Aapi [Music] [Music] Here, just take this, take the keys, how much money have you earned, brother? [Music] Aapi, is this door open, how can it be, I have the keys, look properly, I am saying, look, the gate ahead is open, ok, wait a minute, brother, you look properly, how can this be possible, that is what I am saying, I have done a great job, aunty, you enjoyed it a lot, I saw how you got both of them out of the house, I still cannot believe, aunty, how do you do it, you enjoyed it a lot, I can't believe any situation or person, who gives it to you, and you will handle it, but aunty, you have taken care of this, right, that Aapi might not leave this house, what nonsense are you talking about, I am not saying anything  I am not talking uselessly Aunty I cannot live in a dream world like you, you also shouldn't live there, you are probably forgetting this, what is the illusion, it is not just your son but also Momna's husband, Aapi yes, I feel something is wrong, what could be wrong, Bir, I had the keys, so you only know why it will take you to break the lock, yes, yes, it is my husband's house, I have a place to stay, yes, no, I cannot survive in 10-20 Hajj, ok, I will tell you, we will talk later, why have you come here, where else should I have gone, it is my husband's house, I will come here only, what are you doing here, you got married, right, the story ends in four days, this is not your husband's house and after he left, we have no connection with you, I understand, this is our mother's house, come on, pack your things and get out of here right now, oh Allah, look at the amazing tongue she is talking, I got jealous, didn't I lose my temper, I thought that she had stumbled so much, she must have come to her senses, our enemies stumbled  And very soon Insha Allah you will see me rotting in jail. The police did not find any proof against me, that is why they let me go. And look Kasadan, this seems to be some of your doings. Tell me the truth, you have beaten your father, didn't you? You had big issues with your father, you used to keep saying chu chu chu to your father all the time. Stop talking nonsense, stop talking nonsense. You don't need to talk to me. I do n't even have any interest in talking to people like you. And you had your eyes on my Baba's house from the first day. Yes, so why wouldn't you, it is my husband's house, he brought me to this house as his wife. For God's sake, will you both keep quiet? Whatever mistake our father made is done, but you haven't learned anything from your mistake, which relations are you talking about? Whatever you did to me, at that time you did not remember these relations. Listen wife, I told you that there was a need for me to open my mouth, I told you to stay in Kasadan with respect, but no, you wanted a rich and knowledgeable boy, you got married, your wish was fulfilled, thank God that you did not marry him.  I could never forgive myself, come on, now please forgive me, you did it on your own will, although this relationship had been refused in your father's life, at least you could have saved his honor, why are you engaged in such a useless argument, friend, I will call Faraz and now I feel that we will have to take the help of the police, oh please there is no need to do anything like this, you go inside, I will talk to him myself, what will Faraz think that a new drama happens in our house every day, go inside, brother, I have brought the food items and am going to cook, if you people want to eat, then tell me, Rana Maj Salam Walekum Sahib Walekum Salam, everyone, that Mamna Bibi, and now Bibi has left the house and has also taken all her belongings, she has left the house, I don't know where she has gone, when I asked, Abir Bibi started saying that this is all that is written in our name in this house, we are going to our house [Sangeet] Aapi, you know very well that this woman is a number one fraud, still you have agreed to keep her at home.  We do n't take decisions emotionally till you get married, we will have to live with them in the same house, if they don't agree then we will call them our daughters, it's okay, we can consider them our elders, how can I accept that I am elder, sister, your heart is very big, not mine, okay, please keep this in the cupboard, Sajna [Music] Sajna Sajna [Music] Sajna Parham, I want to apologize to you and uncle, I ca n't break anyone's home, I will build a palace of my happiness on Atul aunty's broken house, this cannot be done by me, aunty hates me and her hatred will never end, if this relationship can end then this is in our control and I swear to you, you will do only what your mumma wants [Music] Saj, you went away, I was helpless, how can I express this pain, Raja Raja, all the dreams became chhamcham, rains, thirsty eyes lost, Sajna Bahara, heart Sajna Bahara, heart Sajna ho, Sajna Haara dil Sajna Bahara, heart Sajna sajave, haara dil sajave How are you decorated [Sangeet] [Sangeet] A [Sangeet] be careful, come comfortably, how are you, I am fine [Sangeet] [Sangeet] R K P but you will drink later, right yes, the girl is fine, where is Mamna? Has someone stopped her from coming to meet me? Maybe she doesn't care about you, that's why she didn't come, I am sure she is most worried about you, it's my misconception, I asked her to come with me, she clearly refused, no problem, anyway, I did not feel bad about her saying this and perhaps she has started to understand the delicacy of the time and your mother's health very well, our house needed such an understanding daughter-in-law [Sangeet], how sad will Papa be when he comes to know that Momna is not at home [Sangeet] what's the matter [Sangeet] son, I have become much better, then why are you so worried and confused? No, nothing, I am missing you a lot at home and in the office, just maybe, okay Papa, Feroz uncle wanted to meet you, some consignment, let me sign, I will call you, tell me how are you  If you are yes then it is fine, now why have you come to take money, you could not do my work with me, then how, have you lost your mind about money, look you will have to work with me only, your daughter-in-law who is with me, now it has become a little difficult to survive with this little money, your daughter-in-law, her child, what should I do, she is not my daughter-in-law, I hate her, her child, her entire family, hey what difference will your hatred make, tell me, I am getting a divorce very soon, then you know and your child, rather taking that child in your lap will be useful to you, now in this old age you are not going to get married again, what all will you spend your whole life begging like this, just do it, I am not a fool anyway I do not have the habit of talking nonsense, I just say what is in my heart, and the truth is that I did exactly as you said, did you tell me or not, and to tell you the truth, the love between both of you is very strong, you tried a million times, what happened, you could not separate both of you, nothing happened, you tried your best, but see you yourself said  I had a misunderstanding, get Kasadan married, I agreed to your request and supported you, I even rejected the promise of my late husband, for your sake, what was the need for me to force you, but I listened to you and did what you said, it's enough, what do you mean by this nonsense, what do you want after all? It's a simple matter, the money you gave me to get me married was all spent in the courts, now I can't survive on the pension, what should I do, wife? By the way, I promise you that as soon as I get a job, I will never even step on your door, I promise you, you are standing at my door, why? Have I taken the contract to bear your expenses? No, no, but I can do something for the sake of humanity, look, the relationship between you and me is very delicate, there is no relationship between you and me, you understood, I am giving you money, but don't show your face to me in future, I have only suffered losses by trusting you, neither you were of any use to me, nor your nephew, it is my mistake, whatever I shared with you  You shared it right, where are you and where am I
