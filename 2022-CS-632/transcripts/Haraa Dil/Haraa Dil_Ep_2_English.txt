Hara Dil Sajna Ve Hara Dil Sajna Ve [Music] Sajna [Music] Guta you are getting worried as if God has done a big crime, you don't suggest any other thing to you men, I am worried thinking what will happen if Momna and I come to know and Momna don't know from where she got involved in this NBA otherwise preparations for her delivery would have been going on at this time, you forgot last year Asiya Bhabhi had insisted so much for her marriage, come on baba, what has happened has happened, what is the use of not digging into the past, I say let's tell Momna and Abir, how long can we hide such a big truth, you have decided that in my entire life I will never be able to talk to my daughters with my head raised, hey, just think for a while and anyway, children of this age, you forgot what the doctor had said, at least realize this, you doctors have no idea about this, now what you and your doctor are thinking  It can also be wrong Tomorrow morning you will take me to some good singing college I don't want this child I will make arrangements for myself before the time runs out Please Shata you are talking as if you have to make arrangements to throw out some garbage I feel sorry for your thinking and I feel sorry for you You are so worried about the one who has not come into this world and you are not equally worried about me and my daughters [Music] I am just making you realize [Music] I don't want this mistake of yours to become a sorrow for the rest of your life You are important to me [Music] [Praise] [Music] Here, take this hot yakhni I made myself Don't make faces Now if you drink it quickly you will get well quickly [Music] Why will you go Are you giving me a headache by walking so much Aapi what's the matter There is no issue with me I am getting worried because Amma's sugar level is getting very high How come Amma does n't even touch sweets yaar Aapi sugar is not caused by sweets but by tension and yours Atul aunty, you are stressed because of her words, this is the result of that. You should not connect everything there. Shukr blood pressure, everything has suddenly gone high. I am not able to understand what to do [Music] [Music] Aapi, the solution to your problem will be found from the street [Music] See, I told you that I will not be able to hide this thing for long. As soon as Mamna and I go, please take me to the hospital. Something has to be done today itself before the matter gets out of the house. I told you to talk to your daughters, they are very intelligent. Whatever decision they take, I cannot support you in this matter. Assalam Walekum Walekum Assalam. Today again you got up before I woke up, didn't you? I told you that I will cook the breakfast today, but no, you have to get up before my alarm and cook all the breakfast as well. I have got your sugar tested. How is your health now? I am fine. Nothing has happened to my blood pressure, sugar, everything is fine. And what happened to you, you are not ready. Go and get ready. Don't you want to go? How can I leave you in this condition? I am not going anywhere today. I will do all the housework and you will take rest, Momna. I am not sick. I am fine. And anyway, if I am confined to bed, I become even more sick. At this age, I will keep getting blood pressure and sugar shocks. [Music] No, daughter, why are you staring at me like that? [Music] Nothing has happened. I am absolutely fine. Go and get ready. You are fine. Nothing has happened to me. She is just saying that she is not as sick as you think. [Music] Go, this will happen every day now. And will you go and sit after taking leave every day? [ Music] You will go [Music] Well, I told you so easily that it will always feel like this. There is a limit to anger, Shata. You are just overreacting. This is a gift from Allah. What is our fault? [Music] What juice have you brought for me? Do n't you remember which juice I drink today? Why do you always forget? Go and take it. What happened to this, Mama? You are probably mistaking Momna for Mano.  So I should not give him space, do you think I will ignore Arham's foolishness so easily? On the other hand, Anush is waiting for Aram's proposal and you are thinking of going to NC, you had a lot of respect, right? Arham cannot do this, Arham cannot do that, Arham will still do what I want, did you understand? Your words are beyond my understanding. You tell me what to say to Anush, there is no need to say anything right now, you just wait and watch, he will himself refuse this relation, if he does not refuse, his life will be made by easily getting into a relation, what else do they want? Haven't you seen that those people did not have the courage to come to your wedding? Well, Mama, you should arrange tickets for my brother to Scotland, I want to relax for a few days, a boring thing like marriage has tired me, you should talk about this to my brother, for God's sake, Mama, he cannot afford all this, but I can do it, I don't know in which family affair you have trapped me? Hello Afan, when are we going, Abrar  At Hassan's house okay okay bring the juice [Music] [Prasha] [Music] It is so easy for you to ignore me because you know you are my weakness I will neither get angry with you nor can I go away from you that is why you are ruining your and my happiness over such a small matter this is not a small matter you know very well that Areej and Atul aunty did all that on purpose and the reason behind that is you I know you should value my words you only care about your words I have seen my caste being reduced to nothing in your house you do n't care about that in spite of all this if I live in a happy state then I have gone mad all your grievances will go away one day trust me I don't know when that day will come I mean I have no complaint against you no complaint you don't need to fight with your mother for me let whatever is happening happen I won't get anything more than my fate okay okay then I will marry Anush what do you mean what do I mean this was not what I meant the whole thing  You don't listen and start talking If Allah has written my fate to be with you Joke I know that it is written [Music] Then I am not going to part ways with you so soon I should have understood, you have the right to be angry with you That's why I am angry [Music] Saj [Music] Look Shagufta I am not saying that you have done anything wrong You can understand this much This is the most delicate phase of life And then this pregnancy Now you are probably not in a position to remove it But Doctor sahab we don't even want this Yes there is risk in both cases There can be harm to the child as well as the mother Okay you come tomorrow Then we will see how the growth of the baby is Then we will continue Okay thank you very much [Music] Thank you Okay Okay let's go Okay Okay Khuda Hafiz Oh Allah brother congratulations to you Tomorrow Phan and Amtul Bhabhi are coming to our house You wanted to take Momna's proposal, right You should be happy Really you are saying the truth Amtul Bhabhi is coming to our house But on that day she was not in the mood  We were meeting suddenly what happened, think that if Atul Bhabhi's thinking can change then anything can happen, now you don't know how everything happened, when did it happen, look Atul Bhabhi is coming to our house for the first time, there should be no lack of any kind of attention, so you take me with you to the market, I will see myself what to buy for her, you are doing wonders, wife, sit comfortably, now you should take care of yourself, sit comfortably, here you are going to become a mother, brother, you do this, get me a list made, I will go once and bring everything, what is the need for you to go, brother tell me, brother take wife, oh, now tell me what to bring, the list will be made right now, what is this, tell me one thing, you did not mention anything to Afan Bhai, wife, is she talking about children, it means he is coming to my house with a proposal for my daughter and I should give him this hobby that my wife is pregnant, you have accepted that this thing is also a hobby for you, see, I am not going to judge any issue.  I don't want a solution, your health is also dear to me, we would have taken a second opinion for this, so you don't worry, you just tell me the list of what to bring, we will see the rest of the things later, I don't understand, I have just read these books, what arrow do I have to hit and anyway what is the benefit of education for girls brother, in the end we have to get married and settle down, and to win the heart of the husband, we need beauty and intelligence, not a degree, see, you know what the matter is, you are not even interested in studying and on top of that you keep demotivating me, this formula of yours about beauty and intelligence is a total failure, that everything can be found in the world except luck, aunty, it would be better if you just talk about this, friend Atul aunty herself is bringing a proposal to our house, by the way, it seems from this that the network of your luck is very strong, it neither hangs nor there is an error, I am scared of aunty [sangeet], she does not see it, it seems that we are doing a favor and the more straight forward we are, the more we are, the more we are.  Yes Amtula aunty is that complicated and this relation of marriage is not just with one person [sangeet] but with his entire family but aapi the person you are getting married to understands you right then what are you worried about [prasnsa] [sangeet] 11:2 I got this call now you must need privacy, let me go out and see what's happening Amtula aunty you are making preparations as if you are not coming with a relation but with a baraat, leave it, do the rest of the work tomorrow I want that there should be no lack of attention for Atul Bhabhi she is coming to my house for the first time for my daughter and whatever happened in the marriage, after that her coming is no less than a miracle Momna is very lucky the sparkle in her eyes has forced me to forget everything Afan is very true to his word I cannot repay this favour of his even by giving my life Yes Arham called and was saying that forget all the old things for my sake, just me So I am happy that you are taking my daughter with great respect and honour, by the way, it is Arham Bhai's plan, the talks were finalised here and they got married there, I think, in order to celebrate Valentine's Day with you, hey, getting married so soon, wo n't we make preparations [Music] Api Api, look what is happening to Mummy, should we take Mummy to a surgeon now, Homi? Mummy, are you okay, what has happened? Mummy has never had fever before, okay, you bring water, yes, go and bring water, I am not having fever [Music] No, if I see with my eyes, there is no shortage, but I am Naati or Allah, just put a little love for me in Naati's heart [Music] what are we, let me get ready, Mummy is calling from there and you are bothering me by getting ready, why do you need to get ready, brother, it's not the first time you are meeting Mama, today I see your face in my eyes every day, think how many times Mama must have met you, how many useless lines are there, right  And that too at this time when I am so tensed, let's hang up the phone [Music] Hello [Music] Sajna what's the matter Shufta, you are not happy about our arrival, you are looking very down, actually Ammi's health is not well for three days, that's why you must be feeling as if you unnecessarily became so formal, I don't eat all this and Afan also has health issues, you know very well that all the food in our house is cooked in olive oil [Music] [Music] what happened, will you keep looking or will you also tell me how you are looking, Mashallah, you are looking absolutely fab, like a simple hero, Atu Lati, I will accept it as soon as I see you, whether you are praising me or criticizing me, what difference does it make, the final authority is Arham Bhai's, isn't it? Amtula Aunty's approval doesn't make any difference, now let's stop making up stories, yes, come on, this is right, absolutely right, you are looking very cute, the sticks are going viral, with this it is absolutely right, ok, tell me one thing, I am feeling nervous, I want to eat more, ok baba, come on, everyone is waiting. Yes, it's okay, go ahead, you're looking absolutely fine, come, you'll be a man, let's go with my hands, okay, okay, come on, fix your dupatta, Al aunty will get angry, which dupatta do you wear yourself, Bhabhi, Afan bhai and Abrar are friends for years, I know this much about you people, you can eat without worrying, times must have changed, but even today, the customs of my house are made as per my wish and change as per my wish, now it's the life of the children, we have already lived our lives, I have always been very impressed by your wisdom, it would have been great if you had taught this wisdom to your daughter Momna as well [ sangeet], unless the girl encourages, the boy's choice becomes meaningless [sangeet], well, whatever was to happen has happened, and even if I had picked up a girl from the street, I would have kept quiet for her happiness, see Bhabhi, we have left no stone unturned in the upbringing of our daughters, and we know very well that they are nothing in front of our happiness and our desire  You can think, I think you should also do what you think is best for your safety, what happened friend Apara, she did not mean this, you were wrong, and you know very well I have never considered my daughters a burden, if I have given them freedom, then I have also trusted them and respected them, I am proud of my daughter, she will never do anything that will make me bow my head down with shame, what are you saying, you are a guest, you do not talk like this in the house, you came to my house, thank you very much, but I do not want such a relationship that affects my friendship with others and I do not want my Momna's head to remain bowed down all her life [Sangeet], I think it is better if this matter is resolved here itself, Arar [Sangeet] Arar, now let's go from here [Sangeet] [Sangeet ] [Sangeet] Aa [Praise] [Sangeet] your hobby has been fulfilled, you have seen, how easily she made a mockery of all your principles of trust, trust and understanding and went away, oh, how can someone go like this, I also did that with her that in future I will not step on the door of my house, she wanted  This was always the case, she was always happy with this, but what will people say, what will people say that the relationship ended even before it could happen, the principles of the world never change for the parents of daughters, if they don't change then it shouldn't change, I don't care about anyone, I am just seeing that I tortured my daughter and she respected me, now don't hurt me by talking about Atul Bhabhi, and my heart is burning, she came to fix the relationship and what kind of things she said and went away, so what have we bid farewell to Momna that you are making so much noise, now stop dreaming about this farewell, you agree, it is her happiness, but no happiness is greater than self-respect, maybe our daughter will yearn for the respect and dignity of becoming a daughter all her life [Music] Papa, please, why are you giving me so many explanations on Mama's words and whatever happened was wrong, you agree that you don't. By the way, Mama gives such big lectures on family values, where it is not about damaging someone else's self- respect.  Where is the value? Look friend, I understand that a little mistake of Abrar's father, Momina and his family have been hurt because of uncle. Will Uncle's mistake be bigger than that? What kind of a way is this to talk? You teach me values. And that too for a girl who is fixing the date of marriage with you. Mama, agreeing for marriage does not mean that the date has been fixed. Even Areej liked Jabar, but you both went with the proposal. Jabar is my brother's son and Momna is the child of a man. Your grandmother picked him up from the road [Music]. You know why Atul, if you don't want to do this marriage, then don't do it. But you have no right to make a tamasha of Abrar like this. Understand, I am making a tamasha and the tamasha that is being created in my house because of that girl? Your mother was fond of helping the poor and orphans. I have no interest in doing charity. And I want to marry her. What will you tell your relatives, in your business community?  Why don't you tell me what is the status of your daughter-in- law's father? Which family does your mother-in-law belong to? You keep on talking about these things all the time. I am not able to understand what is the motive behind this relationship of yours? Why do you start fighting over every issue? It's my life, so the decision will be mine. Life is definitely yours, but I also have a right over it. Do you understand? You ca n't take any decision alone. Wow, the marriage is not done. There will be a business deal that is fixed in the board of directors' meeting. Then I do one thing, I don't get married at all. I don't want to get married. No one has any problem now. [Music] It will happen. [Music] Amma, I am in no hurry to get married right now. Anyway, what is my age right now? I have to go to university and complete my studies after that I have to do a job too. You do one thing, you worry about Abir's marriage. You know, she keeps dreaming about Umar Bukan day and night. [Music] Hey Umar, who is this Umar? Tell me the truth. Will you tell me or should I talk to Abraaj and this Kali?  What kind of drama is going on in the name of grams? Yes, Ami Umar Faran is a model, most charming, most desirable, and anyway, Ami, do you need to buy an airplane ticket to see your dreams? No, girls should not speak with their mouths wide open like this. They should think before speaking. What will people say if they hear it? Yes, Ami, don't think about what people will think. Just believe that if we are destined to have some happiness or any Prince Charming, he may be in any corner of the world, but he will come here after roaming the whole world, in this very street. By the way, I feel that the happiness that we are talking about is named Arham Afan. Now look, Atul aunty must be preparing a script to apologize. And this is not me, but Arham Bhai's belief. [Music] Q. Salam Walekum Doctor Walekum Salam. Come, come, what happened? The patient is not with you [Music] Or have you guys come to discuss something [Music] Yes, at the moment the patient is here. Oh, okay, okay, no problem. Come, come, I will check you up. [Music] hmm hello hello Afan yes Afan tell me look Afal the bitterness and animosity that was inside Bhabhi has come out on her tongue I agree this is a very difficult pregnancy you need a lot of care I cannot suggest you on beds but sugar also has to be kept under control right by the way who is there in your house talks are going on for my elder daughter's marriage and now Mashallah's younger daughter is also of marriageable age I am unable to understand what I should do I want this matter to be ended here only can't you help me a bit in this see what you want cannot happen your son has strengthened his roots inside you son son we are going to have a son oh Allah what all wonders are you showing me [music]
