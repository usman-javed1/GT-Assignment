I will tell you everything. This night has to be spent together in the morning. I will tell you everything. Why did I bring you here? So that we can spend this night together [sangeet] The night is passing by. I don't know about Faraz and Aapi. I don't know where she is and in what condition she must be. I am suffocating thinking about it. Please do something Faraz, you have so many connections. You even got Kas arrested. Please do something. Kas has fled and he is thinking absolutely right. You are such a mean person and I am fully hopeful that he is behind all this. Faraz, take me to the police station right now. If we don't go, Faraz, it will be a great loss for us. Let's all sit down. We wo n't suffer any loss right now. Trust me, if Kas doesn't do all this, then you will see what I do with him. But sitting at home won't do anything, but right now, I can't take you anywhere. [sangeet] Listen to me, change your clothes, take some rest. In fact, sleep for a while. If something happens to you, I will die.  I will go, nothing will happen to my sister. You have trusted me, right? So don't worry [Music] Do you [Music] did you find out anything about Mamna's well being? Any call? May God have mercy on you, what a dark city, no one to tell, no one to listen. My heart is sinking, Fami. As the night is passing, I don't know whose enmity it was with that poor girl. I don't know, I feel as if Kasad took her away. What else, your nephew, why did he do all this [Music]? First he killed the father, now he wants to kill the girl. I do n't know what he will do and why he will do it. But believe me, if he comes in front of me once, I will kill that bastard with my own hands. Okay, come outside, let's sit outside and talk [ Music] Do not give me any explanation for uncle, I have lost my faith. I have no patience with anything he says. He has broken me from inside. Uncle has hurt his son so deeply in the name of love that perhaps his end is not possible [Music] What kind of a mother is this, Baba?  She neither breaks, nor bows down, neither loves herself, nor lets anyone else love her. She does not get peace at all [Music] [Praise] Wherever Momina and I go, she will not let us be happy. Does she not like that? No, Mom, Mom is my respect, my happiness, my life. It is not like that, son, as you are thinking. Your mother may have harmed her community in your love, but she could never do such injustice to Momina. It is okay that till date she has not been able to prove herself to be good, but being a woman, she is not that bad. Papa, you are saying this. It is possible that in your love, she may have forgotten her values ​​of being a mother, but the fact that she can harm any woman, I cannot believe it. [Music] Son, don't come closer, I have felt too much love for you. [ Music] What else can a bitter-hearted and criminal person like you do? [Music] Friend, listen to my advice, stop fighting with me, quarreling with me, getting angry with me, leave all this, think a lot and understand.  that I have brought you here if you agree to one small thing of mine then I will drop you to your house in the morning I promise I don't ask for anything more from you just fulfill one small request tell me I love you I don't want to drown in the fire of your anger and die my aunt also wanted the same thing that we both get married get married aunt this mother in law of yours was all her creation had we got married that day you would have become my wife and I swear to my mother the fun of spending life with such a wife is its own will you keep talking nonsense or will you tell me what the work is I will tell you let this night pass I will tell you everything as soon as the morning sun rises [sangeet] see it's a thing she looks very cute when angry her hands and legs have also started moving [sangeet] ha [sangeet] mummy is sleeping how is your health she is mummy's friend we talked to you comfortably did we get to know where Momina is [sangeet] the police is trying but till now no clue has been found I am not able to understand  What is happening? I too had a doubt at first but after seeing Mama's condition my doubts were dispelled. This is that boy's work. He is taking out his enmity and it is possible that his wife is in cahoots with him. He knows where Momina is [Sangeet] Hey, where am I, call her. I have to talk to her about something important. How can he put such a big blame on me? You take rest, you need peace a lot. Now you know that he went on you in anger. [Sangeet] He can say anything, he went on me only in anger. He took all the other good habits of yours but how did he get such a big suspicion about me? How did he even think that I would get his wife kidnapped? His heart has been hurt. I am not insulted by you for no reason. And then throughout your life you did not give Momina the status she deserved. What all did you not do to her, even to the extent that I was hell-bent on getting her married to Kasi [Sangeet] You have brought me to this state. Atul, now only you can give her a new life.  I can give her [Music] If she keeps getting disgraced like this, I am afraid that she will go away from all of us [Music] [Music] Good morning away son, you have not eaten anything since last night, if this happens, you will fall ill, take care of yourself, I know this is a very difficult time, for Momna's sake, you have to be courageous, she will come back and get very angry with you, Aunty, I am very scared, she will come back [Music] You know, she does not wish bad for anyone [Music] She does not feel bad in this world, still everything goes with her, son, Allah gives great trials to good people, Momna was a mother by nature, she used to take all the problems of both of you with herself, nothing bad will happen to her, Allah gave her a lot of courage and sent her from here and you will see that very soon she will be with us, get up, get changed, come on, change your clothes, then let's eat something, I will just make a call [Music] ah, don't you think that Momna has gone somewhere on her own [Music] I mean that no kidnapper contacted her, if she was kidnapped for the rituals  If he had gone then he would have had some connection, wouldn't he? I think there must be some reason behind Mamna's disappearance in such a big city Mumma please go and rest in your room, you probably need rest a lot [Sangeet] It is said that heaven lies under the feet of a mother I don't want to be rude to you, I do n't want to lose my heaven, please please go, after being kidnapped from here [Sangeet] she will be worthy of you It is very difficult between you and Mamna It is not the distance of one night, but a person can change into something in one night If you say even a single word about Momina's character, I will take my life What is it that you can't tolerate hearing even a single word against her in Momina And you have prepared a complete FIR against your mother You always find me bad, rest I had told you that whatever is happening is not good, now see the consequences, I will do it, you just keep quiet [Sangeet] [Sangeet] [Sangeet] go [Sangeet] [Sangeet] I am not saying anything [Music] Take the food, I don't refuse you, what's the use of you sitting here hungry and thirsty, the loss will be yours only and I do n't like healthy girls anyway, you don't need to sympathize with me, it's my benefit, my loss, let me stay with me, think of your loss which will come to you after this act [Music] you will come in my situation and what do you think, after keeping you here for four days, when I leave you, that man of yours will accept you, stop this nonsense, nothing like this will happen in my life as long as I am alive, you are saying this, now both of our lives are one and my opinion, we should think about each other I feel sorry for those parents who have children, you must only curse them and you are not worthy of anything, no parent would ever want that their child should have a child like you, how much heart would it hurt, it doesn't hurt their heart, it hurts, they don't even remember that they had a son, now your curses and blessings are the issue of people like you, who have lost their love  You get their company too and no one like me does. Do you think that all that you are doing will take us away from each other? This is what I want. You have started to like me. You have started to love me. I am starting to like you. If you are a strong and daring girl like you, then it is great. And with such a girl, settling down is a different kind of fun. For people like you, it is not home but a jail. Be afraid of your consequences. You will not be able to escape from this jail. I have done everything and will save me from it. Well done, eat the food. I will tell you everything. You do n't want to eat. Tell me what you want to do. Get the case of your father's murder withdrawn. Tell me, sign it. I will leave the house with decency. Yes Bir, listen, where are you? Come home, for God's sake. Sameer has become tired of crying. He is neither eating nor drinking anything. He is not even drinking milk. I am having a lot of trouble. He has got a very high fever. I feel he will have to go to the hospital. Come quickly, please. I am not able to understand anything. I have even made porridge.  I tried feeding him, he is not there, yes, come quickly, stop this nonsense, I will never do such a thing, even if I lose my life, do you understand [Music] I will take your life, but a man lives after killing your brother, and whether he does it once or twice, there is no punishment, your brother is very dear to you, aren't you? If you want his life, then spare my life, put him to sleep, will you keep running around the courts and courts? Nothing will come to your hands, both money and time are wasted, put him to sleep, sign for me, look, if you are thinking that the police will catch me, then before going to jail, I have to take my revenge, what do you think, I will get scared of your lizard, never, I will never forgive you, you deserve punishment, not forgiveness, you deserve to be hanged [Music] You look bad down there [Music] Arham Bhai, Sami's health is getting very bad, I am taking him to the hospital, yes, Arham Bhai, I only found out about you, ah, hurry up, he has turned completely white, ch ch ch bha, take him to the hospital  Tell her to go to the hospital, come Sam or get married. Two of our men were caught in the gang, we will be ruined because of this, friend what do we have to do now, let's do something [Music] [Music ] [Music] [Music] Momna Momna, I ca n't handle me, what is my fault in this, friend, I was sitting upstairs, I had gone to feed her, you called her, two were caught downstairs, we have to take them out, why are you standing and looking, go and look for her [Music] [Music] find her [Music] now Aram Bhai, did I get to know anything about you, how is Sam's health, she is not well, she is searching for you even in this condition, where have you gone, why are you not searching for her, you have so many relations with her, why can't you find out anything about her, what are you feeling, am I not worried, I am not worried about her, my life is at stake, friend, it's all my fault, why did I leave her alone, son Aram, small mouth, big talk, but you should also ask your mother, maybe she knows something, see, my nephew, if  If he had not escaped from the jail then I would never have said this, but Kasani does not have the courage to do anything wrong with Momna, he needs some big support, then he can do anything, wait a minute, what are you trying to say? Mama approached Kass [Music] Look son, right now I too cannot say anything with certainty, the way you have been thinking since yesterday, my mind is also thinking in the same way, how can Momna have any enmity with anyone, yes, but whenever I think about Mamna, I remember Begum when she had said that I will take Momna away from Arham at any cost, whether by getting her married or what are you saying, Arham Bhai is already very worried, please do not say such things, we all are worried, right? I was just saying that, well please forgive me if something wrong came out of my mouth, no, I did not feel bad about anything you said, maybe you are right, our thinking is a reflection of our determination, the form you have of Mama  I have seen, perhaps she is talking in the same way, we are your brother and mother, it is better to talk to her than to her, but even thinking like this is a sin for her, and please do not put things wrong in our hearts, not right now, my father also says the same thing to me, I don't know why, his heart has completely gone away from him, the relationship on which we worry the most in life is the relationship of a mother [Music], but if it gets hurt once on that Sunday, then one turns away from the whole world, something similar has happened to me too [Music] [Music] aa [Music] [Music] [ Laughter] [Music] aa [Music] Mamna, where were you, son, what a state you are in, come inside [Music] Sajna, Arham brother, you have come home, how have you come home, with whom is she, I am going to meet her, I will come with you, please no, you stay with Sami, I am coming in a while [Music] ok, how did your feet get hurt, uncle, you ran away barefoot, what happened to you, why are you so silent [Music] are you alright, right? I am fine, but you [Music] What did you say to me? Are you fine? I am fine. That is why I am sitting in front of you. Zinda Salaam. This is not the answer to my question. [ Music] You are my wife. [ Music] Momina, and what do I want to ask you? It is not necessary for me to ask you a question. You should understand from my silence what I am asking you. Your silence and your eyes are making me panic. I am scared. I never thought that you would look at me in this way. It is my helplessness. So much has happened in our lives that I think 100 times before doing anything. I have started fearing myself. I do n't trust anyone. It's not that simple. Momina, if he wanted to finish the case, he could have come to meet you or to this house. Why would he kidnap you and take the risk? Because he is a mad man. If it wasn't so, why would he kill Baba for a few thousand rupees? You are so mad, then he must have tried to get away with it. Shut up, tell me the truth. I won't tolerate your lies. Momina, if it's true  If you tell me, maybe I'll agree Do n't lie to me Just tell me [Music] Has he done anything wrong to you Just do it [Music] If I had known that when I return I'd be asked for proof of my cleanliness and purity I would have brought it I never thought that you would look at me like this And talk to me like this [ Music] [Praise] [Music]
