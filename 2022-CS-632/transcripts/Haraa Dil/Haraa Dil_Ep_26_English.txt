Haara dil Sajna ve Haara dil Sajna ve [Sangeet] Sajna I wanted to talk to you about something I know it will hurt you but I want you to please forgive Atul aunty [Sangeet] and make her sleep No I cannot forgive that woman that woman has no heart she doesn't respect anyone she doesn't love anyone I will not forgive such a woman but she is Arham's mother I cannot see her suffering Arham has told you all this not to say and we have not said anything then why don't you come Arham why don't you take your things with you all his things are here since that day you have not come even once see Momna since the time I came to this house I got all your love and support the motherly love inside me has awakened I cannot see you in pain like this it hurts me a lot tell me what is your fault why is he doing all this to you my fault my fault I have not understood till date [Sangeet] I just can't [Sangeet] then I too will not forgive him [Sangeet] why would Mamna want that you and I should be free from this case, in fact she would be very happy, she came to meet me, I have seen the feeling of victory in her eyes, mother has given me that it is nothing like that, Mama why do you think so and now I have a lot of experience in understanding people, I had told you that this girl will turn our lives upside down one day, see, it happened and those people with whom we are not at all a match, they change our fate, well, leave it, you don't worry, when I get bail, I will take care of everything myself, you do n't need to take any help from Momna or her step mother, Mama [Sangeet] I [Sangeet] Mamna ji and I wanted to tell you something, tell me the thing is that if you want me to forgive your Amtula aunty, then there is a condition for that, what kind of condition, I will go and see [Sangeet] who [Sangeet] is it [Sangeet] Sajna, Sajna, ca n't I come here, you can come, one relation with this house will always be there and the other  Secondly, you want to break it, I have come to make the same relationship again, but you have to agree to one thing of mine, are relationships made on the basis of shayari, no, this is not a condition, this is my wish, I want to give this relationship another chance, why, what has happened now, are you being jealous of me, no, I am not being jealous of you, when I go away from you, I do n't understand what to do, how to react, you have already reacted, so is it my fault, no, I should also be guilty of my mistake [ Music] [Praise] [Music] Look Bhaisahab, I will talk about principles, now you should consider this a condition or a compromise, it is such that because of Sami, poor Momna could not settle down till date, Atul Begum would have accepted Momna in some way or the other, but she cannot tolerate Sami [Music], that is why I want you people to do whatever you have to do and hand over Sami to me [Music] I will raise him well, I promise, I will not let my children face any trouble  I will keep him like this, look brother my nephew Kasi was my only support and then Allah Pak will give Momna more children of her own but I am left empty handed so if you people give Sami to me to raise then I will [Music] I accept your condition [Music] Sajna ve Sajna Sajna Sajna Sajna Sajna me Sajna me [ Music] [Music] Moman [Praise] [ Music] I could not give peace to my mother by snatching the peace of a mother's heart today Sami will stay with you becoming the biggest happiness of your life [Music] and both of you will stay with me [Music] stop my happiness and think, you cast an evil eye on both our companionship and my happiness, in two minutes you do it many times and in the third minute you are out of my life, you yourself are responsible for this because whenever I need you, you are not with me, you are not with me, it is just this small thing, it seems like such a small thing to you, listen sometimes I feel that you will lose me if you keep running away from me like this then you would have run away  You are cowards, do whatever you want to do. I am here in front of you. [Sangeet] I am ready to forgive anyone, but I also know that your heart does not think ill of anyone and you know the importance of forgiveness better than anyone else and no one knows the reward of forgiveness better than you. I know everything, but I don't know why I neither feel sorry for Atul, nor have you forgotten the pain. How did you hold Momna's hand and throw her out of the house and then pretend to divorce yourself? Such a woman should rot in jail for life. What will be the impact on Arham bhai and Aapi's life? Nothing will happen. We will not be there in their lives, both of them will be very happy. [Sangeet] Aunty, please don't forgive aunty. For you, she may be a woman, but for me, she is Arham's mother. I feel bad when you talk about her like this. [Sangeet] So, brother, your sister is neither the world's unique child, nor is there anyone like her, nor will there be. You are absolutely right. There is no one like me and you.  I will come after seeing [sangeet] I knew that this would be the answer of that woman In fact this is not the answer of that woman but Momna has played her last card to let me down I had even refused and told us not to mention this to anyone but Mama are you happier staying here You still feel that those people are wrong and you are right Do you have any idea what people talk about us Because of those people you have created some issue or the other in the life of Momina and Aram and you know what those people say about you Al's mind has gone crazy Mama I have heard all this with my own ears and that is why I am telling you that maybe tomorrow you will get bail then how will you face all those people You have only tonight to think about it [ sangeet] You are all fine here Yes I forgive Atul Begum for killing Kashif Let it be her foster son but he was my son after all It pains a lot but what she did was also not right If you want I can be a judge  I am ready to go and testify in front of the Qazi. Atul Sahiba will be released after my testimony and after the Qazi action, this stain will also be removed from him forever, but in return for that [sangeet] I want a heavy price from you. Tell me what do you want? Momna's happiness and all the happiness that she should have [sangeet] and her father's lot [sangeet] I want that her father's face gets peace and I am also giving peace to my heart. Now I have decided this after a lot of thinking. You will pay my price, right? Don't worry at all. Thank you so much. I will give more than the price you have asked for [sangeet] Thank you one. Take care of yourself [sangeet] Mamma, why is it so difficult? Unreasonable, unpractical. So much has happened but her thinking has not become weak. You and I have become empty because of her absence. This house has become empty. Our life has become empty. Maybe she does not even realize this. [sangeet] She will definitely realize it, son. But she will never let herself become weak in front of us. I know her very well.  She will die but will never reveal her weakness. Nobody likes such a person. Nobody likes Mama. Those who used to follow her around today call her a psycho patient. Well, Inshallah, she will get bail tomorrow and I am hopeful that she will take care of herself soon. If you were not so good, then why would we have any problem? Husband and wife are each other's cover. Son, if there is any shortcoming in someone, then the other person must take care of it. Only then do relations remain strong [sangeet] otherwise there are quarrels, son, there are quarrels in relations. Everything will be fine [sangeet] How are you? I am fine. How are you and how is Fiza? That too is fine. You have not slept yet. I cannot sleep these days. Ever since Mama has gone, the house has become completely empty. It seems that nobody lives here. Do n't worry. And I am hopeful that aunty will get released soon. She may get released but she will not be normal like before. I am afraid that she might go away from us. Don't worry, don't worry and be a strong woman. Everything will be fine. Inshallah it's okay now you can sleep right okay [Music] Bye thank god all the trouble is over [Music] I was longing to see the happiness on your face thank god he has returned my Arham to me even then I was feeling very sad [Music] There was innocence in your eyes but why did I go away from you I was n't even near you and on top of that I don't know what wrong thoughts I was giving myself trouble by thinking now I will never think of such a thing again [Music] No Assalam Walekum Walekum Assalam see Abhir I don't have any doubt I was completely sure that there was a feast going on here hey where is the feast friend we were just having breakfast so you fixed all the planning yourself you did n't even give us a chance to play a match maker how long will you both remain match makers listen we both have now officially become husband and wife and our wedding reception will be in our own house Arham bhai our own house Faraz you knew this and you did n't even tell me so this was that Surprise me with a dance [Music] Do it [Music] [Music] Mama, whatever differences there are between me and my husband, I think they will all get sorted out if we both give time to each other, understand each other, agree to each other's words. What things should we agree to after giving the divorce? What things does he want us to agree to? Mama, there is scope for reunion in our divorce. I want to go from here with my husband. Where do you want to go? Are you in your senses? You are absolutely in your senses. Alright, son. If you have decided to settle down with your husband with full honesty, then Allah will surely help you. Go and get ready. May Allah keep you happy with your husband forever, son. [Music] Go [Praise] [Music] Mama, I am shifting to my house today with Momna. I wanted that we should always stay together, live in the same house, but if you are not happy, then I will not insist on you [Music]. Anyway, I have shifted here nearby.
