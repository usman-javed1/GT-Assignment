[102.37] [Music] there
[105.12] is one thing while scolding
[110.48] I never thought that you could look so cute ah do you think
[114.32] that our relationship is so delicate that it will
[118.00] break if it gets hurt a little bit
[120.68] yes I definitely feel that I am fine

[150.68] staying here what are you saying
[153.32] who are you to throw me out of the house and
[155.44] why don't you want to stay here
[159.48] Feja I am asking you something answer
[162.66] [music]
[163.84] look son I am already very upset don't
[166.88] trouble me too much you both
[169.28] keep fighting like kids every day
[171.72] now come with me I should talk to Ari that what happened
[174.16] aunty
[175.96] please there is no need to talk to Ari
[179.84] my time has been wasted in this house
[181.52] and only
[183.40] because of you I don't know what all happened to me in this house
[189.96] and your daughter's excuse does
[193.80] n't matter to me
[198.04] but
[201.04] anyway Sawar bhai will definitely get affected
[206.04] because when your daughter slapped me
[210.76] then Sawar bhai was with me did
[216.00] he slap you
[219.60] Has she gone mad?
[224.08] I will go and ask her right now. Aunty, please stop it. Your
[228.52] asking won't make any difference in this house.
[230.20] And let me
[234.04] tell you one last thing. What is the biggest problem in this house?
[240.84] Because of you, no one in this house can
[243.60] breathe freely because you
[246.76] try to impose your decisions on everyone.
[250.16] If you correct yourself, Aunty, then
[253.88] all the problems of this house will be solved.
[256.96] You are not going anywhere until Jawar comes. I
[260.16] heard
[264.88] you, you did not come to this house because of Jawar Bhai.
[270.52] I came because of myself,
[274.44] Aunty, and the reason for which I came does
[277.92] not exist now. It would
[282.28] be better if I leave. What are you
[285.68] trying to say? Tell me clearly, Aunty, Haram is
[289.40] no longer the same person.
[291.60] Haram is not the same person for whose love I was
[295.12] drawn here
[297.15] [Sangeet], he has
[298.56] changed
[301.48] and I am not one of those girls who
[304.80] compromise and give their life in
[308.04] anyone's hands. It would be
[315.04] better if I leave from here
[318.43] [

[378.44] slapped Pizza, it was very important to
[381.04] teach your ill-mannered niece a lesson, if she would have said more
[383.88] nonsense, I would have killed her, be
[386.92] thankful that she did not come to this house as your daughter-in-law,
[389.08] Ana, first of all, I would have thrown you out of this house,
[392.60] you know she thinks we all are psychos,
[395.32] what difference does it make, she may think anything, but at
[397.96] least you and you and Jawar, do not
[401.28] create problems in your life, you have
[403.92] forgotten that she is her sister, it does not
[406.88] matter to me, now leave the worry of my Jawar,
[410.28] please Mama, worry about yourself, the
[414.80] person who has come from Dubai to Karachi to ask about Am,
[417.24] Aaya I don't want to have any expectations from him
[422.12] Aa Armaan has given him enough tension that you are
[425.64] creating a new drama Mama please do
[428.56] n't talk about Fiza and her brother at this time
[431.92] Please worry about Aaram You don't
[434.88] want him to come back home soon Then
[439.48] think about his happiness My chapter is closed Let
[442.84] it remain close

[458.80] Water Mama please allow me I
[463.72] want to go to Momina's house I
[467.64] want to repay the debt of responsibilities
[470.72] After that I will come back to you people forever
[475.76] I had promised Abhir that I wo
[481.84] n't
[482.96] let him feel the absence of an elder brother in his wedding So that's why But this can also happen Let it be
[487.32] Afan
[489.40] sahab Whatever you are thinking, nothing like this can happen
[493.48] You are going two hands ahead of your mother in your stubbornness
[499.44] Okay, go
[501.32] but come back soon
[505.48] Papa is not angry with me, right No
[508.56] son, not at all
[510.28] Rather I am happy
[511.60] You are realizing your responsibility
[514.42] [
[523.13] Music]
[526.44] Come on why did you stop Momina from coming here
[529.88] Mama that is her house  She is Arham's wife, he loves
[535.64] her so much, why has she
[538.88] become a wall between them now?
[542.64] I don't understand that so much has happened
[546.84] but your thinking hasn't
[549.16] changed yet. Areej, you have started talking too much. Shut up.
[552.00] What do I have to do? Let me think.
[555.68] This is my issue, not yours. Pay attention
[557.96] to your home.
[561.92] What do I pay attention to? You
[563.80] forget your position. If you
[566.48] talk to your brother,
[570.08] he won't call you. You have to
[572.40] convince him. Look, Ari, there are
[575.96] ups and downs in married life, but one
[578.64] should know how to handle them wisely. I wo
[581.12] n't call anyone.
[582.68] And the wisdom that you expect from me, I
[585.60] expect the same from you too.
[592.53] [Sangeet] oh,
[595.28] ah,
[598.12] bibi,
[600.16] this has come from the post office. Is it in your name
[627.64] ?
[637.12] [Sangeet] [Sangeet]
[645.89] [Sangeet]
[661.08] [Sangeet] what did he
[663.08] do?
[665.66] [Sangeet] this had to happen
[673.60] one day. Why did it have to happen? No,
[681.08] this can't happen.
[683.28] I won't let this happen.
[692.36] I will talk to my brother,
[696.08] how can he do this? He
[698.60] 's my sister's son. I taught him. [Sangeet]  I
[704.44] made them worthy of this, so many favors to both of them,
[708.08] and I will forget all my favors There are
[712.88] no favors in relationships Relationships
[716.80] run on love, so didn't I love them?
[724.68] You might have loved them,
[727.60] but there was no love in our relationship, it
[734.92] was just a contract The contract is over, the
[737.80] car doesn't need me anymore
[741.40] [Sangeet]
[749.48] Now what will you talk to him about?
[751.96] This is an insult to me
[754.19] [Sangeet]
[773.91] [Sangeet] It will be
[784.40] your turn to
[788.88] go away
[794.08] [Sangeet] For a
[799.28] while, tell me one thing
[802.04] You should be with Reeza right now
[805.96] Maybe this is the biggest thing in her life
[810.36] If you are with her, she will get it I don't know
[812.76] what you want to say
[815.84] But where do you get the courage to go in front of her
[818.32] You know all this is
[823.20] happening to me
[826.44] If you had married Fiza, then nothing would have
[837.76] happened with me [Sangeet] If something can still happen, then
[844.24] what can still happen
[847.20] What do
[850.88] you mean if marrying Fiza makes the patient
[855.24] 's house stop it
[857.16] Momna Don't talk nonsense to me Are
[861.36] you crazy or is your love
[864.36] just a drama for me
[867.08] Hey there is no difference between you and mom
[871.28] go from here leave me
[872.75] [Music]
[893.42] [Music]
[897.68] Alone
[902.52] Arham Arham tell me I am listening I don't like your secret Bakul
[906.92] ok leave me then
[909.12] why
[909.91] [Music]
[915.16] go because I found you with a lot of desires
[922.56] why do you say such
[926.64] things you don't talk to me
[930.86] [Music] that
[948.04] I don't understand are you
[951.60] giving time to your business or running away from me
[954.28] tell me so that my expectations also
[956.76] end your
[959.92] expectations are very strange
[962.04] I thought you were so strong
[964.76] minded that you don't need anyone else I am
[969.44] talking about our relationship not about
[971.52] anyone else I am married to you and no one else don't
[978.52] behave in a practical and typical housewife way it's
[979.84] not
[982.08] good and it's very simple that you
[985.12] enjoy your life and let me do my work
[987.88] see I
[991.20] don't interfere in your personal problems nor do
[993.16] I interfere in your family matters
[994.96] you should evolve from this  You will find out
[997.92] what is common between you and me
[1000.00] No, I don't
[1003.68] understand Everyone needs space in their life
[1010.32] Anyways I am getting late for office
[1014.16] and yes, I will not come to your cousin's wedding tomorrow
[1023.32] I don't need you either
[1025.58] [Sangeet]
[1041.14] [Sangeet] I
[1047.40] am
[1048.77] [Sangeet]
[1072.08] how I am very upset for you Why are you
[1077.08] upset then what about you
[1079.47] [Sangeet]
[1084.72] how I used to feel that you have no interest in brothers I
[1087.36] also used to feel the same You used to
[1093.80] fight with uncle for Momna
[1098.24] I used to laugh
[1101.68] But now I have realized that life
[1107.32] definitely matters somewhere
[1109.43] [Sangeet]
[1111.44] Samar never fell in love with me
[1115.72] So
[1118.28] maybe I also started expecting something like this from him I will
[1121.40] talk to him if you tell me
[1124.96] Right now just a legal notice has come
[1128.20] You will beg for
[1131.36] love from the husband for me
[1134.48] And I will call the thing that you ask for mine
[1141.28] Do you think I
[1148.00] am like that [Sangeet] No
[1151.96] But I have never seen me broken and defeated like this
[1156.41] [Sangeet] Don't
[1174.32] worry
[1175.99] [Sangeet]
[1191.02] [Sangeet]
[1193.88] Areej's passion has shown us this day.
[1198.48] Jawar is absolutely right. Areej never
[1201.20] tried to build a relationship. You probably
[1203.76] went to meet Jawar. Yes, I had
[1206.16] asked Areej to give me the divorce back. So what did
[1208.60] he say? I mean
[1212.44] what was your deal with him? Why are you overreacting so much?
[1216.88] You know
[1219.28] that I am so tensed right now. The
[1221.40] stain of divorce that is
[1225.28] going to be attached to Areej is not an ordinary thing. You are
[1227.08] considering it an ordinary thing. It is not
[1228.80] such a big deal. It happened a few days ago.
[1231.84] You were also thinking something similar for yourself. What is a
[1236.36] normal thing for Momina or you,
[1242.96] how can it be so extraordinary for Areej? Just do it and
[1245.60] stop talking like this. Now you have started talking a lot.
[1250.12] Leave it. So what was the deal with me?
[1253.64] My marriage with you, your
[1256.40] business, whatever it is, he
[1260.60] can become a partner in it.
[1262.56] But the happiness of Areej's house is in your hands now.
[1270.40] Mama, you let it be. I am leaving. Where are you going? That is
[1273.76] not your house. That is
[1276.32] your Nikai wife.  This is her house,
[1278.52] what would people say, what would people think, people don't have
[1282.08] that much time, so
[1284.56] you too should not think,
[1288.60] Abir's wedding is after two days, I do
[1292.04] n't want to leave my work incomplete
[1298.04] [Sangeet],
[1304.88] this decision of yours has broken her
[1308.32] and she is not the same as she was with you
[1311.48] before
[1312.03] [Sangeet],
[1314.68] after you left, she realized that
[1319.44] she never wanted to be separated from you,
[1321.68] so what can happen now, everything can happen,
[1326.44] look, there is still time in the hands of both of you, it is
[1330.60] very difficult and I am not so selfish
[1334.60] that I will hurt Fiza for my own happiness,
[1340.20] look, I am responsible for whatever happened with Fiza,
[1344.28] why are you punishing Reez for this,
[1347.16] then you yourself are selfish that you
[1352.16] gave so much pain to Harish for Fiza's happiness, there is no
[1356.00] use in reliving old things
[1358.76] and you
[1363.48] know better than me how to maintain a forced relationship, I just
[1365.92] know that this forced relationship had
[1367.72] made a place in Reez's heart
[1369.31] [Sangeet], if
[1373.92] you want, everything can be like before,
[1379.08] please think once, do you want it to be
[1381.80] like before  Yes, why not? She is
[1385.44] waiting for you only. Do you
[1387.24] want you and Fiza to be together again?
[1392.44] Answer
[1394.23] [Music]
[1402.36] I am leaving
[1409.09] [Music] Why did
[1411.56] you come? I
[1414.16] came to meet Jwar. There was
[1419.60] no benefit to me. Fiza, you know I am married to a girl
[1424.44] who thinks beyond the benefits of her caste and humans
[1429.32] and she forces me to think like this.
[1434.56] I am learning from her to be happy in the happiness of her loved ones.
[1441.20] So you also
[1443.76] think,
[1448.56] where did you come from in the midst of Jwar and Areej's happiness? If Jwar Bhai and
[1453.48] Areej were happy with each other,
[1456.08] then no one could have come between them just
[1461.08] like no
[1463.96] one could have come between you and Mamna
[1467.99] [Music]
[1486.96] Take care of yourself [Music], look at me and talk.
[1492.48] What is left to talk brother? So
[1495.68] what, what you told aunty and talked to Erich, was
[1498.80] all a lie
[1500.70] [Music]
[1503.04] Who accepts defeat brother, who likes to
[1507.80] accept defeat
[1509.99] [Music]
[1511.32] I also did the same thing that anyone would have done in my
[1514.64] place. I
[1516.96] put the blame of my defeat on someone else
[1519.92] and I have always been like this.  I will keep doing it
[1524.28] because I have never learnt to lose.
[1529.28] What happened? What are you doing?
[1533.72] You see, if I want, I can turn your defeat
[1539.28] into a victory. There is a
[1545.64] difference in winning and achieving. Brother, you are
[1549.48] saying that I got my every insistence accepted and
[1555.00] I fulfilled all your insistence.
[1560.97] [Music]
[1564.64] Why are we talking about all this
[1567.00] brother, just tell me
[1569.76] when are we leaving from here
[1571.40] because I cannot stay here any longer. I am getting suffocated
[1576.96] now. I too am starting to get suffocated.
[1595.49] [Music]
[1598.80] Salam
[1600.68] walekum, please show me the sets for the wedding
[1603.40] and show me the red one. [Music]
[1615.16] It is good. Look, there is red in it too.

[1640.32] time. I am coming in a little while.

[1672.28] n't know what is going on
[1674.64] between both of them in my opinion there is
[1676.40] only one solution of this issue and we should

[1681.64] Atul aunty cannot disturb him

[1860.04] whom will I show my face? Will you
[1864.20] call the whole of Pakistan?
[1871.24] La la has hurt me.
[1874.12] [Praise] To
[1881.88] shut her mouth, today I have come
[1896.40] from your home. Today I have got this gift.
[1904.00] Thank God a million times. Today her
[1907.24] second daughter will also become our Raki.
[1911.92] Papa Veer will become a part of his home.
[1916.16] But until Mama herself opens the doors of that house for Momina,
[1921.20] I and Momin will not return to that house. It is not like that,
[1924.44] son Atul. She is
[1928.16] not the same. Understand.
[1930.00] It is right that she will never reveal it to you.
[1934.96] But now she wants from her heart that you
[1937.80] and Mamina come back. Why don't I feel
[1940.84] so? Hey friend, believe me, why don't you say this looking into
[1944.84] my
[1949.60] eyes? You should only
[1951.92] talk to Momina looking into my eyes.
[1954.68] Understand,
[1958.40] I understand what you are saying. By
[1962.28] staying with you, she has also become clever.
[1973.44] You said it absolutely right. [Music] Well, son, all the preparations are complete. Yes,
[1977.20] Baba. Of course, I had talked to Faiz for the
[1979.92] marriage.  We will do the rituals today itself.
[1981.96] Okay
[1985.28] Baba, there are tears in your eyes.
[1990.60] I am very happy
[1996.12] Abir. I always wanted such a function.
[2000.64] Today, everything has been possible only because of you.
[2005.48] I am not able to understand
[2008.12] how to thank you.
[2009.60] If I were your father, I would thank him as well. [
[2018.68] Sangeet] I
[2021.40] have to thank him as well.
[2026.06] [Sangeet] I have to thank him.
[2049.69] [Sangeet] I have to thank God. What are you
[2054.52] doing? Your makeup will get ruined. I
[2057.40] love you. Because of this, I
[2065.32] wanted to tell Afan uncle and Aram bhai about it. Now, it didn't seem
[2067.64] good to say it openly in front of them. Makkal has
[2070.12] fulfilled her duty of friendship to Baba.
[2071.96] And Arham bhai has fallen in love with you.
[2076.04] Brother, I don't know when I will see that day
[2079.24] when I will make you my bride and live with Aram bhai.
[2082.08] And when will the world between you two end?
[2086.20] What happened? Veer, how many times will I have to
[2088.56] leave? And anyway, it is a relationship of the heart between me and Aram,
[2095.88] I don't care about it.  But it would have mattered to
[2099.28] Arham bhai,
[2102.40] he needs not just your love
[2105.04] but also your company. Just
[2108.84] promise me that from today onwards this room is for both of you. From
[2112.20] now onwards make Sami sleep with Femi aunty.
[2114.96] Brother, your life should also begin,
[2119.12] Veer and he have come here only for your wedding
[2123.68] and that is why I had come here. It is
[2129.08] not right for them to stay here
[2131.32] and I also don't want that they
[2135.68] can afford a separate house for you and you.
[2138.28] You will have to go with them. There is no
[2141.08] time for all these other things. So many things.
[2155.80] Okay, listen, once you get married, you settle down in your house. Then I will see, then I will think. [Music] Okay, hey bhai, someone please look at us too. We are
[2158.28] ready. You are looking very sweet.
[2161.84] Masha, why right
[2164.60] now? Okay, listen,
[2167.40] I have put Sami to sleep after getting him ready. The guests have come downstairs. Please
[2169.32] come quickly. You guys have done very well.
[2170.88] I was also thinking of seeing him.
[2173.20] How long will it take? I am ready. So, please pay
[2177.84] attention to what you said.
[2181.68] Okay, just make your mood good.
