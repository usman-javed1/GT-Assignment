You were talking about father's relationship, I think Abrar Bhai has come, I will see, Fehmi Aunty's relationship, who will marry him, it's strange, age is like that of aunties and the behavior is like that of a girl, one thing is that my Amma is also very fond of studying in other's farm Nayla, I am going towards Abrar Bhai, close the door, the sound of Sami's crying is coming Just pray that the child is well  Are you with me I will also come No no you stay at home close the door don't tell Fahmi aunty otherwise she will get up and come ok you close the door many many congratulations to you for Sami's safe return just sir ji Allah has done a lot of good deeds of course I have done a lot you know the whole night I did not get up from my prayers I kept reciting nafal and kept praying to Allah for the well being that Sami should return home safely you know I spent the life of an orphan I cannot see the pain of a child I was about to come as soon as Zeba told me that Sami has returned I was about to come then I thought you kept hanging on Suri the whole day take some rest by the way our prince is fine he is fine right where has he been roaming around just show me come inside the room yes [Music] Sami [Music] what happened why are you looking worried right now are you alright [Music] so your brother has also come back now what is the problem nothing I am missing mummy [Music] Bir do you remember how we used to wake up in the morning  She used to come and wake us up in the morning and then to tease her we used to put a pillow on our ears and would not get up and today my eyes open at the slightest sound [Music] Do you know, sometimes I also think that I wish Ammi would have stayed with us for a few more days when I think that everything is going to be fine something or the other goes wrong I am also afraid that the memories of Ammi may also leave this house [Music] I will not let that happen Aapi this is our mother's house and ours Abraaj sahab I will check Sami to make sure that he has got any injury or maybe he has got any internal injury and now I have come you need not worry [Music] No Quite a filmy situation the child got kidnapped the police raided the railway station and found the child you too in which world do you live I don't know which people fool you D Mama you are right the police found the child in a single day and that too in this city where children are born every day and nothing happens to them  I don't even know. Look, I don't want to talk on this topic. It is not an easy task to make you both understand. You too Afan. Abrar Hasan had created this drama to garner sympathy and money from you, but he could not succeed in this drama because you yourself reached there with the police. Anyway, I have told you that I don't want to talk on this topic. I know such people very well. Make the child disappear for two-four days yourself and then create a drama so that you reach there with the money for the tawa. Because you are always a soft-hearted person and they know this. And the money that you take would go straight into Abrar Hasan's pocket. You had told me that he has lost his job, so even in unemployment his mind works a lot. It is impossible to make you understand. Hello, yes Fiza, how are you? Your son was telling me that you have fallen ill because of the exams. Well, you are fine now. Thank God. Well, listen, tell me when are you coming? Next week. Well, just come soon. I am missing you a lot.  I am okay my love okay Khuda Hafiz that Mama does so much drama, isn't it, in this world everyone is a drama queen [Sangeet], after what happened yesterday I am very scared, such people are waiting with their eyes on everyone and how long will I keep guarding Sami, the nanny is not even aware, don't make this mistake again sister, I am thinking of sending Sami to a day care center, what happened brother, day care people cannot take care of such a small child properly, your child has got a second life [Sangeet], for his life I can give my life, there is no need for you to give your life, Sami, think what to do next, I don't have even an iota of hope from your daughters, despite all this, they don't even realize, didn't you see how she was sitting with her room closed [Sangeet], I have only one solution to your problem, I had told you this before and I am saying it today also, you should get married otherwise your child will cry, oh sister, even when there is a step mother, the children cry, right, and now So even Shagufta's scattered belongings have not been gathered and you are asking me to give her place to someone else. No, I am not asking you to give her place to someone else. She was the mother of your child and will always be. It feels good to think about it. In reality, a mother is needed to raise a child, even if she is a step mother. Now see, after a few days Abir and Momna will get married, after that you will have to do everything yourself [sangeet] I realize that you think well of me, but I have two young daughters. This is their marriageable age and both of them are already angry with me. And then the truth is, I feel ashamed thinking about marriage. I am asking you to get married. It is not a crime to get married again under compulsion. This situation has come because of your daughters. What do you think? I may not have explained to her. She did not even talk to me. I don't know what is her stubbornness about this child. [sangeet] She has no attachment to this child and is only punishing me. In this process of punishment, your child will go into the wrong hands, brother Brar. And then whether the mother sleeps or not, she will take care of the children.  She will scold and beat me but she will keep it in front of her and there can't be a better mother for your child than Funny [Sangeet] Sit down, it seems life has taken me back 20-20 years. Do you remember when I was about to become pregnant, I had become extremely fat and the doctor had asked me to go for a walk but you used to die because of my walk because you had to do it with me, you know, I used to repeatedly remind myself that Brar Miya, I have promised to support you for life and you get scared of even a little walk, you kept your promise very well and you are still keeping it, I wonder that I don't know for which good deed of mine that Allah has given me you, for God's sake, don't talk such big things, I start feeling embarrassed [Sangeet] I loved you a lot but perhaps something was lacking in appreciating you, I realize this, I have two daughters and now a son and with you, my life is full of happiness and what else am I lacking, wife, are you really happy It is the burden of happiness that does not let me get tired. This time is very difficult [Music] It is really a very difficult time. Forgive me, my love has lost to my helplessness. [Music] I am thinking of living in this house of yours with your memories. [Music] I forgive me, forgive me, forgive me [ Music] I cannot give you your mother. There must be some woman who will love you like a mother. A woman is a mother, she fulfills her duty till her death. Forgive me, forgive me [Music] Your heart is looking very lovely. It must have come from my in-laws' house. Oh no, it is my own. Nothing came from my in-laws' house. I will recover everything after going to my in-laws' house. Pammi, you are looking so lovely. Mashallah, you are looking very beautiful. Thank you. Okay, listen, tell me, have you talked to your brother? Have you told him all my conditions? Because, see, I have done exactly as he said. Now, he will have to do exactly as I said. Yes, yes, I told him everything. He did not get any objection on any matter.  No, you will be happy with him your whole life. Well, that's a good thing. But one thing is, I am afraid that his daughter will spend her entire life remembering her dead wife. Because I ca n't trust your words. You are 100% devoted to him. Tell me, I am very scared of such decent people. Why, what disease are you the cure for? You don't know how to control a husband. How do I know? Yes, but I will learn from you. Okay, what a beautiful lehenga it is. It's looking good. It's looking very nice. You're looking very cute. [Music] By the way [Music] Apara Bhai, give it to me right now. I will take it to his bride, Amma. She is getting very restless to take it in her lap. And if I look at your aunt, you've found a very modern one. You've already found a child in her lap. Yes, brother, you've hit the jackpot [Music] Here, here's a cute little gift. You'll pay the Mehr amount right now. [Music] Yes, I'll pay it right now. You write down Rs. 5 lakh.

My lovely Sami [Music] Baba, you freshen up, I will prepare the food. Okay, then we will sit together and have food. Okay, come here. It's a mutual matter, I didn't understand anything about your marriage. And when you had to live in the same house even after marriage, you should have made a simple deal to raise the child. And the face is also your own choice. Do you feel ashamed or not? What do you think I made a deal? Hey, did she have any compulsions? Anyway, I felt pity for that child. Oh, what should I tell you. The motherless child had become a tennis ball. Sometimes here, sometimes there. Well, this is a very difficult task for you. Take care of the children, brother. As per your wish. When is the departure scene, brother? Owner, you will have to give notice to the house as well. And when you leave this house?  If my fort goes away then what should I do here, I will go to Sakhar or Dubai to sleep, brother, right now they have to talk to their daughters and I also want the same, it is good that they talk to the daughters happily and willingly, they should take me from here, I don't want any mischief to happen and then there is some affair going on regarding the marriage of their elder daughter too, how are their daughters by the way, they are very cute, they are very beautiful, the younger one is a bit naughty but her features are very cute, oh aunt, it is a matter of features, don't do this to me, the features of your nephew are no less cute, it is a matter of oath, girls don't die to talk to me, I swear, if I turn towards them and see, do n't talk to me in such a way, don't show me this shame of my relationship, the village is not settled yet, Taku has already come near, I will talk to him and will also finalize the relationship, but remember one thing, if this thing comes out of your mouth, it will not be good, you should not even tell your mother, okay and why do I have to tell anyone anything  Do n't you tell your mother Just take care of one thing Whenever you go to a party at in-laws house, you have to take me along Do n't forget this lovely nephew Yes, it's done now go to sleep I have to sleep Abra sahab will come early in the morning to leave his children and go to office I haven't even eaten food Who got this biryani made by your Siddique brother You have made it very well He is brother Come on aunt Good night yes good night brother O tea Sammy s ch ch ch ch chik baba He is so chubby, isn't he, little one Today I will take him with me Let it be son, if he wakes up at night, your sleep will be disturbed So what if he wakes up We will play and talk, why Sami, anyway, I don't know I have to go to the university in the morning We will be together comfortably Baba you know me You [Music] [Praise] [Music] [ Praise] [Music] [ Music] Do it, you have not been too late Son, I wanted to hear a lot [Music] I wanted to talk a lot It's our talk [Music] Uncle This life is not run by us, life runs us [Music] Every day is a new thing  He brings a lesson I agree it's too late [Music] but there's still some time left [Music] and that time is in our hands you know how life becomes after mother passes away [Music] life gets stuck here darkness engulfs the eyes if mother's face is not in front everything becomes desolate [ Music] the day passes somehow baba if [Music] after mother leaves every night is like this [ Music] like dark and stormy [Music] the night is telling the truth [Music] son ​​how does the day pass the night becomes very heavy [Music] it becomes very difficult to pass [Music] baba [Music] sorry I'm very bad but foolish I didn't talk to you [Music] that I did n't love Sami forgive me baba but today today I make a promise to you [Music] [Prashant] that I'll take care of Sami more than my life this is the last memento of my mother [Music] don't fall into the hands of such people [Music] do n't live son  g r [music]
