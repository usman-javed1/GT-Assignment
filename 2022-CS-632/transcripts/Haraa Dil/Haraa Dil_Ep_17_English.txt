And do you know that whatever decisions Arham has taken till now, they were not his decisions but Momna's?  It was the reaction to the refusal of the girl and how do I know this, your beloved son himself has told me this, he has asked for time, he has asked me for time, I have fallen so low to come out of the intoxication of my old love, do I not have any other option to get married, do I not want the favour of your son's marriage, what's the matter, he should marry me, all the rituals should be with me, but there is someone else in his heart, I do not accept this, nothing like this will happen, Fiza, do not compare yourself with that girl, son, Mama, neither your insistence will be fulfilled, nor will he be able to be happy with Pizza, you should write this down, I also know her this much, these middle class girls also make their pride an issue of everything, sacrifice everything in emotions, but son Arham will marry you only, this is my promise to you and he will keep you very happy too, I can go to any extent for your happiness, whether you consider it my insistence or mother's [Prashan] [Music] Haq Falla Mara Diye, the heat has worsened, here come the ration brother  I gave money to Jeba, the poor girl is so nice, she was saying that every month I will deliver the ration to your house, why did you get the ration for our house delivered, Jeba aunty, have you gone mad, yes I have gone mad that I have got into this trouble, I don't have money, get all these people to talk to me and you keep trapping your prince like brother, I think you got something from your father and he died poor leaving behind no factories, we don't have a penny to spend, were you somewhere in Baba's office, still you are saying that you do n't have money, yes, the office people called me by phone, I did not reach there flying, you should get jealous, I am not jealous about this too and neither do I have time for all these things, see, there are some kitchen items, bring them and also bring something for Sami, I am just telling you that out of the money those people gave, only my medicines came, the office people were telling that your father has taken a big loan All the money that comes from them is spent on debt, we don't get anything [Music] Well, how can this happen? Baba never said anything like this. Look, how can this happen? I have a lot of things to say. At this age, he shouldn't have had a child. Then your mother died. Then you married me and brought me to this house. And then you yourself died. Tell me, none of this should have happened. Where do we take this matter? I was just asking why Baba would take a loan? How do I know why your father took a loan? You should have asked him when he was alive. You must have had some need. And these people from the office are not relatives of anyone who will forgive our debt. Even relatives don't forgive debts. But what do you people know about how relations are maintained with relatives? If we spend some time, we will know that our life is going on well even without relatives. That is visible [Music] Well, that relative of yours had come to congratulate. It was good. Very quickly, he thought that he also had to congratulate. Now if someone comes to pay tribute, we can't stop him, right? Stopping him is a far cry. We shouldn't open our doors for such relatives. Look at these worthless people. Whenever they felt like it, they became relatives. Whenever they felt like it, they broke the relationship and left. Is that a problem? [Music] They did n't come to make any relationships. They only came to pay tribute. Well, this is a good thing. At least I thought, you have forgotten them. By the way, don't worry about your relationships. But for your relationships [Music], please don't worry about me [Music] The last time I went to meet Abrar, I had broken all relationships with him and come back. Then neither did he come to meet me again after that, nor did my Ana allow me to go to him. It's very bad, very bad. I wish I hadn't done this. This feeling of not being with him at the last moment haunted me all my life. [Music] I too regret a lot. Papa, Fiza and Mama both knew about this and both of them hid this thing from us. [Music] Mama, I can never go to this extent in hatred.  I could not even think and then what happened to her, why is she doing this, your mama did very bad by hiding the news of Abrar's death from us, but the regret is that in her eyes a living or a dead person has no importance, she can go to any extent to fulfill her purpose, but baba, this was not love, this was sheer selfishness, you have no idea how much I am hurt by mama's act, I can understand your condition son, but I also know Amal's nature very well, she loves you a lot, but she loves her caste more than you [Sangeet], she does not see anyone else in front of her caste, Papa, I feel very suffocated, I feel myself in some prison, please let me go, I am not with Momna in her most difficult time, what could be a bigger relief for me than this [Sangeet] everything will be fine son, Inshallah everything will be fine [ Sangeet] will go [Sangeet] Assalam Walekum Walekum Assalam, what is this Riya you have created  Hey brother, what should I tell you, I am in Iddat, so I used to leave the house on the pretext of medicines, I have to maintain my modesty, I wore this because if my neighbor would have found out, she would have caught me beforehand, I would not have given up, I feel like talking about something important, we will keep talking about important things, I swear by Allah, I am feeling so hungry, I have to come here everyday, my brain is tired of eating dal and rice, order me something nice to eat, for now drink this juice, it is very hot, by the way, what important work had come up that you called me here, you could have called me to your house, you could have sat there and talked to them peacefully and with this excuse I could have seen your house also, now we are related, what do you think, I called you here to establish a relationship, so what other motive could there be, how did you get my number, well, this was what I was thinking, brother, do you not want to come to my house, that is why you are calling me to you, how did I get your number, how were you called here, this is not for you to understand, the thing for you to understand is why I called you here, that is what I tell you now  what is the matter I want you to take your Momna away from my son's life so much that my son never sees her face the meaning is very simple Mamna you make such an arrangement that she is worthy of Aram [Music] no because of her Aram disobeys me a lot which I cannot tolerate at all oh Allah what is there to be surprised about in this we hate some people so much that we feel like killing them [Music] but if you kill them then where will we bury them this is your job yes I will do it ok ok then I will tell you on phone [Music] Arham I wanted to talk to you about something important can we go out I am not in the mood to go out will you go ah how can I go alone I have to go with you please leave me alone I am not going out I was having a headache I have come home to rest we will talk later Arham why are you getting angry at me by doing all this do you want to prove that it was all my fault that those times ca n't come back  I can't come so leave it [Sangeet] A look I am a very straight forward girl I can't talk in a roundabout way I just did what aunty told me to do [Sangeet] And anyway I think aunty is right those people are not capable of having any relationship with them who is capable and who is not capable how can you decide this without meeting me this is not my decision this is aunty's belief listen fiza we both have to spend our lives together the important thing is how much our thinking matches Momina Momina is first of all my friend [Sangeet] so is she still your friend she will always be my friend no matter how much we fight or get angry but this Jag Mamna is in my heart no one can take that [Sangeet] [Sangeet] can [Sangeet] [Prashansa] what is this rudeness what are you doing here just like this I feel embarrassed why does your nephew come here everyday in baba's life he was not allowed to come here then why does he come now hi  Allah, what has my beloved son done now, Kasi Kasi, where will he stay? O Aunty, I had gone to get water for you. Just listen to me. If you are so fond of meeting him, then go and meet him at his home, but he will not come here. It is better that you explain to him in your own language, O Wife, first you listen, I have brought him up like a son. Wherever I live, he will stay there. My house is his house. I called him myself. He had to go to the market, didn't I? And then he had to sell the ring also. It does not matter to me whether you sell the ring or the earring. But this person will not come to my house. Yes brother, this is your house. It seems I will live as a tenant in this house. I was just helping you. What are you saying that you have got so angry. Don't talk nonsense. I do n't understand the need to talk to me. [Music] You, Tauba, Tauba, see the symptoms. [Praise] His Aunt, now I want to marry this girl. My tongue is like a hot chilli and her face is like a red tomato. Oh, if such a girl comes in your life, Aunty, then with her.  The fun of living life is ours. Just get me and her married as soon as possible and then enjoy later. Come here and see, there is no need to do anything wrong. This hot chilli that is burning right now will make your mind go crazy. You don't know that you cannot do this either. So aunt, tell me how to get your point across. I know very well how to get your point across. I have told you not to do anything wrong. When ghee can be extracted with a straight finger, then what is the need for you to bend the finger. Live with respect, stay in the neighbourhood. How long will we keep moving from one house to another like animals? We have a bungalow like a palace. Be a little patient. If you are saying so, I will accept it aunt. But my marriage and her marriage should be done soon. Just take it, drink the water, son. Have you brought water? Have you mixed poison in it? You are not going to die so soon. You have to die only after getting me and her married. I will play a game for you. Today, I will play a game for aunt with my own hands. I will take this, this is a game to play. No, don't play, my mind is dizzy. Did n't you see?  She has behaved so badly, play the game, don't worry about her, let her tell you once, I know very well how to handle her, if I get some free time, I will take her out of the house, bring this work of mine and do my work very well, I know I should become yours, you have brought me up by bringing me up, I have n't learnt anything, but I will learn something, I thought, you have troubled me a lot, mama [ sangeet] so that's it, then why are you fooling me or yourself, love her and make her, she doesn't even accept it, she doesn't need love, she should accept it [sangeet] she needs belonging, maybe mama has something to give her, listen to me, if she really loved you, then she wouldn't have thought about all these things and would have been happy with you, everyone else becomes normal, earlier I was angry with her, but now I feel that maybe she was absolutely right in her place, where there is no respect, life becomes like a prison, please all these things are useless, boring philosophy is not that boring, if  If you understand [Sangeet] So are you regretting it now If I had a way to go back, then probably I would have definitely regretted [Sangeet] And she does not believe in these half-hearted relationships And she wanted to come to this house with everyone's happiness Maybe I cannot give her this happiness That is why she found peace in going away [Sangeet] And I will come to this house But in your heart [Sangeet] It takes some time for the weather to change [Sangeet] Come on, Aapi and I brothers are not happy with our engagement [ Sangeet] Faraz has also noticed this What difference does it make There are many people who are not happy Yet they spend their lives with each other There is still time Well, tell me Faraz When is Mumma coming to Pakistan I am not in a hurry to get married I have to focus on my studies right now Oh why I just want you to settle down quickly You will settle down and go to your home I do n't want you to do everything that I did [Sangeet] Walk on the path that I walked and held her hand [Sangeet]  Just gone Abhir [Music] Abhir [Music] Even today she falls asleep while talking and there is me, the whole night is spent with my eyes wide open due to fear, Oh God, please give her such a peaceful sleep always, mother also turn off the light, friend, I am feeling good sleep, yes, I will do all the work, you sleep comfortably, see aunt, I will tell you one thing, don't make any plan to get you killed and your madam, please be on the side, she will get trapped.
