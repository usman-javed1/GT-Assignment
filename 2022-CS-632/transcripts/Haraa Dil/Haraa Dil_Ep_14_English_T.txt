[212.12] not I have been calling you since long and
[214.72] your phone is also busy oh brother sahab will you discuss
[217.52] everything while sitting in the office, you do
[219.20] n't intend to come home, tell me when will you come,
[221.96] what will I do after coming home,
[229.64] I can see the signs of my defamation tonight,
[232.00] people will say that my daughter has
[235.80] left the house, please make me talk to Momna,
[240.20] hey how can I make you talk to Momna, ever since you have left the house
[242.88] she is
[244.76] lying in her room with a sheet on her head, now it will be good, I should
[247.48] go and knock on her door, yes yes, it will definitely be
[249.88] good, you knock and tell her that it's my
[252.24] phone, listen to the phone, okay
[255.65] [Music]
[268.60] stop
[270.92] this
[272.69] [Music]
[274.08] here it's Abba's phone,
[278.16] yes Baba, Salam Walekum Walekum Assalam,
[281.80] why is your phone switched off,
[285.52] Baba, your phone has broken after falling,
[289.04] she will not pick up my phone, has Abhir
[292.80] reached or not, after all what do you both want,
[295.56] you sat hiding from the world and she is trying to get
[298.44] me disgraced, Momna,
[301.48] I feel that I am the
[304.24] most cruel father in this world  I am the one who has
[307.60] become the enemy of the happiness of my young children.
[312.00] After all, there will be someone to forgive my mistakes.
[315.80] After which you people will
[318.44] not make me stand in trouble every day. Baba, please do not say
[321.16] such things. I had called her college,
[324.04] they were saying that she has
[326.28] gone on a college trip, her entire class has gone. She is
[328.28] not a child and neither has she run away from home. So
[332.44] what, could she not have made even a single call?
[335.96] Well, her father died for her, she could have
[339.12] called you and told you that how far
[340.92] she has reached. She does not care for anyone,
[345.16] but I am her father, I am worried about her,
[350.32] Baba. It is possible that she might have called me,
[353.80] but my phone is broken. You know
[356.28] how Beer is, she enjoys troubling us. She must be
[359.52] enjoying herself comfortably and will
[361.72] come back and make excuses. Please do not
[365.08] get worried. If by mistake you get her call, tell her
[368.84] that you buried your old father with your own
[371.88] hands. You will come back home,
[375.88] but you will not get your father.
[378.68] God forbid Baba. Why are you talking like this?
[386.88] Baba, you did not have breakfast in the morning.  You went, right?
[389.96] That's why your sugar level is going down. Yes,
[392.72] yes, it's all my fault.
[395.72] What is Sami doing? He has fallen asleep after waiting for you.
[399.88] You know today he has
[403.20] got his first tooth and in this celebration,
[405.92] I have made your favorite Nargis Koftas for you.
[408.48] Live long and
[412.44] be happy. Yes, listen, when you come back, bring Sami's
[416.40] milk. It's about to finish. Yes, while
[419.60] coming, Fida also gave me a list. I have to bring
[421.76] some things. There is some medicine. I do
[423.60] n't know what it is. Anyway, I will bring it. And listen, I will bring
[427.56] hot naans. You do
[430.12] n't cook rotis. Okay, Baba. I am going to make salad.
[433.80] Come quickly. Okay son. Khuda
[437.20] Hafiz. Khuda
[443.85] [Music]
[447.32] Hafiz, let me tell you one thing. If you don't agree, then
[450.76] I don't need to hide from anyone in this house
[453.56] because I do
[456.08] all the work of this house and I also take
[459.68] care of Sami. So it would be better that you don't
[462.76] give wrong news to Baba. Didn't you understand
[466.24] what I am trying to say?
[468.48] Look, the matter is very simple because I
[472.56] consider you a guest in this house. That's why I love
[475.20] you more than you.  I don't even have to do the
[478.20] household chores myself and this is
[480.16] not a favour to you but please it would be better that you do
[486.00] n't
[489.32] create misunderstandings between Baba and me son
[491.52] look I have heard that
[495.68] guests are not daughters of the house they are full of anger
[500.84] but I think
[503.52] you have planned to stay in this house forever
[505.96] now you are saying such things
[510.16] this is my personal matter it would be better if you do
[513.28] n't interfere in this
[516.36] you have
[518.96] not developed such a relationship with Sami that I feel that
[521.68] you have married Baba for the love of Sami
[523.64] hey look sister Abba had come to you to
[527.60] marry me he had made me
[529.92] crazy by begging me what was the
[532.88] need for me to embrace this trouble I had
[535.72] lived a good life happily and
[539.72] fine you brought me here so
[541.72] now you should appreciate him and be thankful to
[545.68] Allah that you have got such a good and noble husband there is
[548.00] no need for you to come between us
[551.40] I think you are very quiet
[554.72] but one by one you are showing the colors of
[558.48] both of you sisters  It's amazing, I
[562.28] remembered my brothers and sisters, tell me whether your
[566.00] sister intends to come back or not,
[568.44] or will we have to print missing posters,
[570.80] your father will not have to go through this,
[574.00] listen wife, the Nargisi
[578.72] Kofta type thing that you have tried to make on your own, there was no
[581.84] salt in it and there was no chilli anyway, so
[585.44] I added a little salt to it and made
[587.40] it tasty
[589.25] [Music], I
[592.40] request your Ila that Baba
[596.52] rarely eats salt, so there is
[599.88] no need to add salt to show him that you have made the koftas,
[602.24] I have told him, Allah
[609.12] [Music]
[610.56] Tauba-e-Chandal ne hai
[615.10] [Music]
[616.40] this girl is of no use to both of them, it's
[621.64] good for her Kas, she will take care of his house as well and
[625.68] she should
[626.68] also get the
[630.48] thought of the younger one out of her mind while talking to Kas, I will get
[633.92] this done,
[648.96] so Papa how is your health, my health is

[1829.24] completely light from crying.

[1852.64] Aunty, someone is calling Arham on his phone.
[1855.88] Please attend to him. Maybe it is an important
[1857.88] call.
[1859.00] Hello Arham, I am Momina, I am talking
[1864.04] to uncle.  Get them to do
[1866.64] some important work? Do you have any shame in you
[1869.60] or not? What do you want? I
[1876.56] want to request Afan that Arham and Fiza's engagement should not happen. I feel
[1878.20] ashamed of such parents
[1881.36] who gave birth to a child like you.
[1883.60] Aunty
[1884.98] [Music]
[1886.16] Please
[1887.63] [Music] Don't
[1893.64] say anything to my parents. My father, you are no more in this world. I
[1897.68] called Afan uncle just to tell him this.
[1902.16] [Music]
[1909.25] [Music] It
[1916.16] was
[1922.94] [Music] [
[1932.29] Music] No
[1937.24] one will
[1940.12] come. Make preparations for Baba's funeral.
[1943.44] What
[1945.16] happened? You didn't talk to Awan uncle.
[1948.56] You didn't tell him
[1951.28] or you didn't talk to him at all. None
[1954.88] of them
[1959.96] cares who died here.
[1963.60] Just a human being. I have never been a human being in my entire life till date.
[1974.31] [Music]
[1976.04] Look,
[1980.00] what happened,
[1982.76] aunty, nothing. Don't mention this to Afan. I don't
[1987.68] know if someone told that girl
[1991.12] that you and Haram are going to get engaged. That's
[1992.92] why you wanted to talk to Afan and that
[1996.52] too on Arham's phone. If she has even the slightest
[1999.52] shame in her, then
[2001.44] she will not call again.
[2003.32] You should block his number,
[2007.56] block all the numbers related to him, he will get
[2009.40] rejected.
[2013.28] How intelligent are you to
[2017.00] spend your life with such a complicated son.
[2019.04] Now you will have to bring some understanding.
[2022.60] You both should be happy with each other.
[2025.56] What more do I
[2031.20] need? My phone was available, has anyone seen it?
[2033.72] Yes, it was kept here, so
[2038.16] Fiza
[2039.68] gave it to me. Look, if there was some other girl in place of Fiza, she would have
[2044.16] checked all your messages.
[2046.75] [Sangeet] What
[2048.88] things are you saying,
[2051.52] aunty? In my place, the
[2054.80] girls in his phone list are in my heart.
[2057.92] Please do not compare me with them. There is no
[2060.64] comparison between you and anyone.
[2064.12] Why, I told you the truth, don't
[2068.92] know
[2073.18] [Sangeet]
[2081.88] How long will it take
[2085.34] [Sangeet]
[2095.88] Okay, it's
[2098.88] time for Baji to go.
[2102.32] Okay, Bhaiya, go today.

[2112.56] Saheb along?

[2132.32] them, they are taking my husband away, will they
[2136.44] bury him in the dust, hey they are

[2147.76] now he will not return, she is taking
