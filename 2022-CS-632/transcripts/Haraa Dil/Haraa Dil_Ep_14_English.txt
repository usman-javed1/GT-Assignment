After all, there will be someone to forgive my mistakes. After which you people will not make me stand in trouble every day. Baba, please do not say such things. I had called her college, they were saying that she has gone on a college trip, her entire class has gone. She is not a child and neither has she run away from home. So what, could she not have made even a single call? Well, her father died for her, she could have called you and told you that how far she has reached. She does not care for anyone, but I am her father, I am worried about her, Baba. It is possible that she might have called me, but my phone is broken. You know how Beer is, she enjoys troubling us. She must be enjoying herself comfortably and will come back and make excuses. Please do not get worried. If by mistake you get her call, tell her that you buried your old father with your own hands. You will come back home, but you will not get your father. God forbid Baba. Why are you talking like this? Baba, you did not have breakfast in the morning.  You went, right? That's why your sugar level is going down. Yes, yes, it's all my fault. What is Sami doing? He has fallen asleep after waiting for you. You know today he has got his first tooth and in this celebration, I have made your favorite Nargis Koftas for you. Live long and be happy. Yes, listen, when you come back, bring Sami's milk. It's about to finish. Yes, while coming, Fida also gave me a list. I have to bring some things. There is some medicine. I do n't know what it is. Anyway, I will bring it. And listen, I will bring hot naans. You do n't cook rotis. Okay, Baba. I am going to make salad. Come quickly. Okay son. Khuda Hafiz. Khuda [Music] Hafiz, let me tell you one thing. If you don't agree, then I don't need to hide from anyone in this house because I do all the work of this house and I also take care of Sami. So it would be better that you don't give wrong news to Baba. Didn't you understand what I am trying to say? Look, the matter is very simple because I consider you a guest in this house. That's why I love you more than you.  I don't even have to do the household chores myself and this is not a favour to you but please it would be better that you do n't create misunderstandings between Baba and me son look I have heard that guests are not daughters of the house they are full of anger but I think you have planned to stay in this house forever now you are saying such things this is my personal matter it would be better if you do n't interfere in this you have not developed such a relationship with Sami that I feel that you have married Baba for the love of Sami hey look sister Abba had come to you to marry me he had made me crazy by begging me what was the need for me to embrace this trouble I had lived a good life happily and fine you brought me here so now you should appreciate him and be thankful to Allah that you have got such a good and noble husband there is no need for you to come between us I think you are very quiet but one by one you are showing the colors of both of you sisters  It's amazing, I remembered my brothers and sisters, tell me whether your sister intends to come back or not, or will we have to print missing posters, your father will not have to go through this, listen wife, the Nargisi Kofta type thing that you have tried to make on your own, there was no salt in it and there was no chilli anyway, so I added a little salt to it and made it tasty [Music], I request your Ila that Baba rarely eats salt, so there is no need to add salt to show him that you have made the koftas, I have told him, Allah [Music] Tauba-e-Chandal ne hai [Music] this girl is of no use to both of them, it's good for her Kas, she will take care of his house as well and she should also get the thought of the younger one out of her mind while talking to Kas, I will get this done, so Papa

We are investigating it. Tell us where you live. If you don't live here, then where do you live? I am in Hyderabad. So you are one of his close relatives. Yes, you will have to come with us to the police station and there is some necessary action. You will have to help us in that. I actually have to go right now, there is some important work.

Whatever you say [Sangeet] Okay, I will tell Mana as well. [Sangeet] [ Sangeet] The police have come to ask Gaj. Son, they want to ask you some questions as well. [Sangeet] Give me some [Sangeet] [Sangeet] You do not suspect anyone. Baba did not have any enmity with anyone. It does not mean that you cannot arrest his murderer. You can do anything if you want. Do n't worry. Inshallah, we will reach Kalo very soon. And if you find any clue, then definitely tell us. Take care of yourself. Come, you catch him [Sangeet], Munna son.  I have been asking you for so long that it is time for the funeral, please inform whoever you want to inform. Ra was a very good man, whatever his matter was, it remains in this world. I don't want that you too should not get peace by carrying any burden in the form of him. Aunty, I have called Ar many times but she is not picking up the phone and there is no one else whom I can call. He is your father's friend, it is your duty to inform him son. Then his intentions and his actions. I do n't have uncle's number, I will call Arham and see if he can come. Okay son, you fulfill your duty. The rest of the complaints keep on coming. You call and find out when he is coming. Tell me. It cannot be that he does not know that his brother has passed away and he is sitting there angrily. You talk to him. You have become completely light from crying. [Music] Aunty, someone is calling Arham on his phone. Please attend to him. Maybe it is an important call. Hello Arham, I am Momina, I am talking to uncle.  Get them to do some important work? Do you have any shame in you or not? What do you want? I want to request Afan that Arham and Fiza's engagement should not happen. I feel ashamed of such parents who gave birth to a child like you. Aunty [Music] Please [Music] Don't say anything to my parents. My father, you are no more in this world. I called Afan uncle just to tell him this. [Music] [Music] It was [Music] [ Music] No one will come. Make preparations for Baba's funeral. What happened? You didn't talk to Awan uncle. You didn't tell him or you didn't talk to him at all. None of them cares who died here. Just a human being. I have never been a human being in my entire life till date. [Music] Look, what happened, aunty, nothing. Don't mention this to Afan. I don't know if someone told that girl that you and Haram are going to get engaged. That's why you wanted to talk to Afan and that too on Arham's phone. If she has even the slightest shame in her, then she will not call again. You should block his number, block all the numbers related to him, he will get rejected. How intelligent are you to spend your life with such a complicated son. Now you will have to bring some understanding. You both should be happy with each other. What more do I need? My phone was available, has anyone seen it? Yes, it was kept here, so Fiza gave it to me. Look, if there was some other girl in place of Fiza, she would have checked all your messages. [Sangeet] What things are you saying, aunty? In my place, the girls in his phone list are in my heart. Please do not compare me with them. There is no comparison between you and anyone. Why, I told you the truth, don't know [Sangeet] How long will it take [Sangeet] Okay, it's time for Baji to go. Okay, Bhaiya, go today. What are you people taking? You are taking Saheb along? [Prashansa] [Sangeet] So, you are taking my wife along. Stop them, hey, stop right now. Show me, Allah, how are they taking her away?  Stop them, they are taking my husband away, will they bury him in the dust, hey they are taking my husband away, hey Rajpur, he went away after serving me, today he left the house and went away, now he will not return, she is taking Araj sahab, aa a sahab no, I will go, I'm Raj Fami Fami Fami Nala, bring water quickly Fami Fami Fami Fami come to your senses [Music] [Praise] [Music] Ala Maula [Music] Maula
