[52.96] great happiness for Ammi baba
[56.92] Ammi is becoming a mother of a son
[58.92] and the truth is that
[61.48] daughters can never take the place of a son
[64.40] they cannot live with their parents for the whole life the
[71.08] real
[73.64] victory of life is the son
[76.25] [sangeet]
[77.88] those people will win
[81.96] but I can see our
[84.76] defeat in front of me
[93.04] [sangeet]
[114.56] this was bound to happen Ammi Arham bhai's
[117.04] demand is not wrong we will
[119.96] break the relation you will see it because of you I
[123.04] also have enough understanding
[126.16] and this Aapi she is mad she will die suffocating like this

[145.84] happily give my life to you, have
[147.68] you gone mad, what are you doing,
[151.08] both of you listen to me once,
[154.28] if both of you misbehave with your mother
[156.64] or harass her, then I will
[159.84] take him away from here. I want peace in this house
[163.00] and I want his health. Hear you
[166.20] both understand that your father is dead,
[169.24] son, what happened to you, my
[174.36] condition is such that my mind goes crazy,
[176.92] but you should control yourself,
[179.20] hey, how should I control myself, I do
[181.40] n't care about anything else, I am
[183.92] only worried about my marriage, you
[186.08] know Atul Bhabhi, if she comes to know, then
[190.52] what will happen, Atul Bhabhi, Atul Bhabhi, Atul
[193.24] Bhabhi, is she
[195.72] God, what will happen if Atul Bhabhi comes to know, she will
[198.88] break the relationship, she will break the
[201.44] relationship, what are these relationships
[204.01] [Music],
[210.96] I want this child's life at any cost, that's all I
[238.68] want [Music] [
[253.56] Music] [
[265.68] Laughter]
[268.22] [Music]
[288.32] what's the matter, you all seem quite tensed  Something is going to
[292.28] happen as per your wish,
[294.92] you should be very happy, what do I have to do to be happy,
[300.20] but why do you think that if I
[301.96] am tensed, there will be only one reason for it, it does
[304.76] n't seem so dear,
[307.64] I am reading this sad face of yours, there is
[310.64] only one name written on it,
[313.48] please give time to your son, there is no need to read my face,
[321.12] what has happened to you, both of you do
[324.24] not tolerate each other at all, the
[326.60] problem is not with me, it is with your beloved son,
[330.32] why don't you do one thing, it will be alright if you get him married,
[334.40] but after that he will be of no use to you,
[338.32] I am not going to get him married so soon,
[342.48] but till yesterday, was his marriage
[345.04] too early for you, there is a difference in saying and doing
[350.12] [sangeet], for the
[355.84] first time in life I have seen such parents,
[362.32] strange thinking, at this age the thought of having a son
[369.68] came, whereas at this age one's own life
[373.00] starts feeling like a burden
[373.61] [sangeet], I am
[375.88] hating this son
[379.32] who has not yet come in our life and has
[382.04] made our life hell,
[383.92] please shut up in my head now  There is already a
[388.28] lot of pain, nothing will happen if
[392.24] I keep quiet, but don't
[394.24] react so normally on Arham bhai's silence,
[396.28] what about Amma and Abbu, they have nothing to do
[399.76] with our happiness, they have no
[401.36] need, they are getting their own son
[403.56] who will stay with them all his life, you
[406.08] worry about Arham bhai, call
[408.64] them, what should I tell
[411.40] your Arham bhai, I do
[414.08] n't have any argument to give, there is no time for argument, you
[416.04] love him, right, I can't live
[419.20] without him, you just need to tell and explain, there is
[422.96] no need to argue in love, Aapi, you have a
[426.80] lot of understanding, who talks about these things, no
[430.96] one talks like this to you,
[434.76] but I keep my eyes and ears open, come on,
[436.96] call or talk to him, we must be waiting for Bhai,
[441.16] introduce him right now, you are the one I am
[443.64] saying,
[446.08] come on, on one hand your marriage and on the other hand this
[448.72] child, I am
[449.92] not able to digest this,
[451.52] how should I explain to Mama, if
[455.00] we and you what you want is not possible,
[458.16] earlier there was so much tension going on in our house about all this,
[461.12] but Baba also got very
[464.64] hyper, said Amma  She hasn't eaten anything since last night. It is
[470.04] not right to take tension in this situation. She cannot take stress. So I
[473.60] want to end this tension. I know that as the pressure
[476.48] increases, the problem will increase for her.
[482.24] I have a friend, her mother is a very
[485.12] good gynaecologist.
[487.08] Listen to me. She
[489.56] can help us. Please
[493.48] tell her to meet her once. She
[495.96] knows her mother and I know that she will
[498.68] handle my situation comfortably.
[500.76] Amma will not go to the gynaecologist.
[503.60] Why won't she go? She won't go for our happiness. Is
[507.96] n't it about our happiness? It is
[512.00] about Baba's wish. He is going to be a
[517.00] father. He
[523.72] wants a son at any cost.
[526.92] And if we force him too much, he will
[530.36] take Amma with him and leave from here. He has
[534.00] said
[536.18] [sangeet]
[541.40] what happened. Uncle will behave like this at this age.
[544.68] I could never have imagined. He
[549.88] should have taken Aunty to the doctor at that time itself when he came to
[551.76] know about all this.  What all does not happen these days,
[553.88] Baba, sometimes I have to say that
[557.08] what cannot happen, for
[559.04] them all this is no less than a sock,
[563.24] this is definitely strange,
[567.60] but
[570.72] perhaps the
[573.28] desire for a son was much more than the love for daughters,
[577.20] this middle class thinking, daughters do not
[581.44] earn money, so we want a son, he will
[583.48] become a support, he will earn money and give, this is too much
[588.53] [Sangeet],
[596.08] you will see,
[598.12] this child will become a source of happiness for you people
[601.11] [Sangeet],
[606.28] your life is at stake for both of you, I have no control over it, I will do
[611.08] anything
[621.08] and this innocent's life should
[626.88] not be put in such a test,
[630.92] you tell me what should I do, aunty, why are you talking like this,
[636.32] this test is not just for you, you
[639.68] know uncle better than me, I cannot
[642.24] change his thinking, this is a very
[645.12] awkward situation for me and
[647.48] for Momna as well, please understand this as well,
[649.72] I do not deny anything you say
[652.96] [Sangeet]
[655.80] son,
[657.52] but the decisions of life and death are
[660.48] not in the hands of man
[661.66] [Sangeet],
[663.56] know one thing
[666.88] Son, if the fate of this child is my lap, then
[671.68] I cannot change his fate
[677.51] [Music]
[680.93] [Praise]
[682.46] [Music]
[690.76] Aunty has given her decision,
[694.84] now you just pray
[698.88] that the fate of this child does
[701.72] not clash with our fate,
[706.12] otherwise I will lose you
[708.84] [Music]
[720.07] [Music]
[729.84] [Music]
[747.88] Oh,
[752.16] you are not being too serious about that girl, there are only a few
[753.96] days
[756.92] left for the wedding, what is the need to do Nikaah,
[760.08] I think it is their
[762.36] planning and middle class thinking, Mama, but what is
[766.48] your problem in this, of course we will get married
[769.80] after some time, I am not in any hurry for the marriage, it is becoming
[774.60] so difficult for them to organize the wedding event
[777.56] and you are
[779.28] putting another expense on their shoulders by doing Nikaah,
[781.12] I feel that maybe our
[785.88] future daughter-in-law is not giving much lift to our son these days,
[788.12] that is why he is in a hurry, am I
[791.92] right, no Papa, there is nothing like that,
[796.40] actually I want to apply for a
[798.88] visa for myself and Momna for father studies  So
[803.84] marriage is necessary for her. So
[807.32] such long term planning has been done.
[811.64] I had told you that the girl and
[814.52] her family are smarter than I thought. By the way, what
[819.92] other methods of taking shortcuts are
[823.04] they teaching you? No, no, there is no
[825.16] such thing. Then you should also
[827.88] see that you will get a chance to celebrate this marriage twice. Have you
[831.80] ever
[835.44] taken anything seriously in your life?
[840.87] [Sangeet] If it's your
[844.20] brother's call, I will talk to you later.
[851.40] Hello
[853.80] Aaya. Now tell me why do you want to get married.
[857.72] I had told your mother to
[860.44] put forward her point.
[865.04] Tell me the truth. What should I tell you
[867.68] papa?
[870.80] Shagufta
[873.52] aunty, what are you? Aunty
[877.72] Shagufta aunty is pregnant.
[891.36] I did not expect such audacity from you.
[895.44] Yaar, you are going to get your daughter married and on the
[898.88] other hand, your wife is going to
[901.68] become a mother. Have fear of God,
[904.12] yaar. And on top of that, you are saying with great pride
[906.96] that I am going to be the father of a son.
[909.20] What should I do if he grows up at this age?
[911.80] At this age Allah is showering his blessings on me,
[913.92] so how can I not be thankful to him
[916.24] friend, friend, I wish Allah had showered his blessings on me
[918.96] when you both husband and wife
[923.56] were of the age to raise a child, now at this age you have put her in trouble,
[927.24] look at the child,
[929.76] marriage of a daughter is a big responsibility, what all will she
[931.68] do in a year and then the
[934.68] world will say 10 different things, well leave these
[937.36] things and tell me whether we can get Arham and Momna
[940.40] married after Shagufta's delivery, friend,
[943.28] you have completely lost your mind, I
[945.96] swear by God brother, I want the marriage to happen
[948.60] right now, today itself, you don't know my wife,
[951.20] friend, tomorrow she will create 10 fuss, friend, what about
[954.12] Atul Bhabhi, she can
[956.60] create a problem even on a small matter,
[959.40] I have to see my wife too, the
[961.76] doctor has asked her to take complete bed rest,
[964.08] her blood pressure becomes high,
[966.56] in these conditions how can I involve her in the wedding work,
[968.68] anything can be harmful,
[971.60] you are understanding what I am saying, right friend,
[974.32] I am good  I am understanding this way but your
[975.84] mind has gone to waste. Hey brother, Aram also
[978.56] wants that this Nikah should happen first. The
[981.48] marriage will happen later when the situation gets better.
[984.20] At least the Nikah should happen
[987.52] now. You are
[992.72] right. I am ready for Nikah.
[996.72] Whenever you
[999.48] say this, friend, your son is more intelligent than you.
[1002.60] Thank God, you also get your senses and
[1006.32] understand things. Sometimes, friend, I have been
[1009.92] explaining to
[1019.76] you for two hours. I had already told you that Sh Gupta's
[1021.64] pregnancy is not normal.
[1023.56] I am trying to normalize the stress hormones from day one
[1026.24] but
[1028.32] I am not able to understand what is going on with her?
[1029.76] What is the problem
[1032.14] [Music]
[1043.32] Doctor sahab, I take a lot of care of her.
[1049.56] Perhaps, I think that she is upset because of her daughter's marriage.
[1054.88] My advice is that you please
[1057.96] postpone the marriage because the mother and the child are
[1060.24] underweight and I cannot give them a heavy dose.
[1063.68] It has side effects. The child
[1066.16] 's life can be in danger. The mother's life
[1067.80] can be in danger.
[1072.04] Currently, I am putting her on light tablets.  etc. I am
[1074.96] giving it to you in writing, you get it started,
[1079.88] you people, the whole family should take care of them, they
[1082.32] need your attention, they need the attention of the family,
[1084.08] yes Doctor Saba, thank you very much,
[1104.76] come on, let's go
[1110.92] slowly,
[1119.04] you sit, I will come, we are
[1124.44] walking slowly
[1133.00] [Sangeet]
[1137.32] no
[1145.32] [Sangeet]
[1152.16] I feel that Abdul Bhabhi has seen us,
[1154.60] I don't want to face him in this condition,
[1156.92] yes, please take me from here quickly, we are
[1159.12] walking, you take some
[1162.28] rest while sitting here, you are behaving as if
[1165.44] you have seen a ghost, not Atul Bhabhi, will
[1169.68] you leave the city out of fear of Atul Bhabhi, if it were up to me,
[1171.64] I would leave this world itself, first of all
[1174.12] you mother and daughter, I don't know
[1178.32] why you are hell-bent on troubling me,
[1181.96] okay, I will get them checked up,
[1185.76] come with me
[1199.95] [Sangeet]
[1209.44] [Sangeet]
[1224.24] I had advised you to meet Doctor Jiya,
[1226.12] so I am giving you some tests in writing,
[1228.44] so please get these tests done
[1234.80] [Sangeet]
[1240.72] I think Ammi should
[1244.12] wear this saree in the wedding, for this  There is work on the pallu as well, this is
[1246.52] good and decent. Look, in this condition, the
[1250.36] saree will not look good on Ammi. Why are you trying to
[1253.12] make fun of yourself and her? What
[1255.40] happened to Ammi? In fact,
[1259.08] now she has become even more weak. She will look
[1261.68] good, smart.
[1264.20] I don't know. You look at her [
[1267.92] Sangeet],
[1292.74] [Sangeet] The
[1305.28] silence of both of you forces me to scream.
[1309.24] Why are you treating
[1315.24] me like an untouchable? [Sangeet] Both of you have made me a fool for my whole life.
[1320.08] And what was the flaw in my love
[1323.08] that your respect has decreased? No
[1329.60] Ammi, there is nothing like that [Sangeet] There is no
[1335.68] flaw in your love [
[1338.64] Sangeet]
[1339.80] and neither can our respect ever decrease. It has
[1346.96] just
[1348.76] increased so rapidly that I
[1351.52] cannot understand what to talk to you.
[1356.16] I don't even want to do this Nikah,
[1359.64] not at all. Now see, you should rest in this condition
[1362.72] and you are
[1365.68] sitting here upset because of me
[1373.09] [Sangeet]
[1375.84] Now I would also go, your Nikah should happen
[1378.92] as soon as possible,
[1381.12] you should become a part of your home.  My heart should be
[1384.00] satisfied
[1387.04] son, I got a call from Amal Bhabhi. She has
[1391.68] invited us all to her house for dinner yesterday
[1393.56] and has specially asked you to come. She has
[1397.92] invited everyone. I mean, she has
[1402.24] invited me as well. Yes, it's a family
[1404.52] dinner, so obviously everyone has been invited. We have
[1407.40] n't agreed. Whatever happens will be seen.
[1412.24] Amma, you wear that green silk suit of yours.
[1414.52] Its dupatta is big and its stitching is
[1416.68] such
[1419.40] that it doesn't feel felt.
[1423.04] [Music]
[1443.20] 20 years
[1447.16] ago, you both gave me the happiness of becoming a mother. It was
[1452.24] so priceless that it
[1457.92] always kept me brave.
[1463.20] But son,
[1466.80] becoming a mother is not an easy thing. One has to listen to big things.
[1474.20] Now if someone says something, I will
[1477.64] not break his face and then I will ask him,
[1480.80] tell me, what is that work which sons can do
[1483.48] and daughters cannot.
[1492.76] Amma, today I will myself cook food of your choice for you.
[1498.39] [Music] Do you feel like
[1501.80] eating something special? Do
[1505.96] n't you
[1509.12] son? Don't give me something to eat?
[1513.92] [Music] I
[1526.68] go [
[1537.35] Laughter] [Music
[1537.37] ]
[1544.56] By the way, I, no, Aram Bhai, have agreed with you.
[1547.84] Where are you going for your individual studies,
[1550.28] how much will you take for keeping quiet? You have a knack of surprising our
[1553.52] wife,
[1558.88] by the way, I think that now the snow has started melting on the mountains,
[1562.64] she has arranged all this feast,
[1566.76] for the happiness of her son, she can do anything, you are
[1571.80] absolutely right, I can do
[1574.48] anything for the happiness of my son,
[1578.32] but I cannot tolerate the lies of Abrar and Shagufta,
[1591.16] which
[1596.72] lie,
[1598.68] so you knew this beforehand that a
[1603.16] support for old age is going to be born in old age,
[1606.20] wow, Phansa, very good, by the way, you have kept the
[1611.52] secret of your friend very
[1615.04] well, for this you should
[1617.88] get the Ejaz Shield,
[1621.16] and Shagufta, if
[1624.64] you were not so sad, then why do you hide this act from
[1628.08] me, right, Mama,
[1632.00] please, he is our guest, you will not say a single word,
[1636.88] oh, how a guest is respected in my house, it is
[1640.40] not you,
[1642.76] I have always done it and even today I will
[1646.52] do it, Bhabhi,
[1649.72] today the
[1652.12] respect that you have shown us by calling us here  I have done great honour to you, I will
[1655.96] always remember this,
[1660.28] making a spectacle of someone's life and being happy after that, if this is not a mental disease then
[1664.16] what is it,
[1666.96] but you have always had this problem, come on, wait a minute,
[1671.48] Abra, I will
[1675.04] tell you what is called a mental patient, normal people do not wish to have a
[1678.08] child at the marriageable age, they
[1687.00] want a son at any cost, this
[1691.28] mental disorder is in the genes of people like you, stop it,
[1698.12] I knew it, yes, you always
[1701.64] knew everything, still you have brought this small family and made them sit at
[1704.96] par with you,
[1708.16] what will people say, what will people say, Afan
[1711.52] sahab, does this happen in respectable families, they will
[1715.72] say to you that Arham's mother-in-law has
[1721.04] gone for delivery, disgusting, there is
[1726.84] a time for every work, I am
[1732.44] not surprised but I am getting terrified thinking about it,
[1736.40] Bhabhi,
[1737.96] I wanted to tell you but I did not have the
[1740.36] courage, your
[1744.12] anger is absolutely justified, absolutely my
[1746.20] anger is justified, but this child of yours does
[1749.68] not seem justified to me
[1751.45] [music]
[1754.16] because you were denying its existence,
[1758.40] you wanted that your daughter  So that the
[1761.40] marriage does not get postponed, you are very intelligent, Shata
[1764.72] Mama, please stop what are you saying, I
[1768.20] knew that aunty is pregnant,

[1862.51] [Music]
[1864.84] Excuse
[1865.57] [Music] I'm
[1868.20] doctor, without saying anything seriously. I am
[1871.24] disturbing you right now, but the
[1872.72] condition of your patient, Mrs. Abrar, is
[1874.40] not good at all. Her abdominal movements have started. There
[1876.92] are chances of premature delivery.
[1879.64] Oho, what we were afraid of has happened. You should
[1883.92] shift her to the OT. Please
[1886.00] keep checking her BP as well. Okay,
[1887.80] I will come just now. Okay, okay.
[1892.72] Excuse
[1896.20] me, doctor, how is Mummy? A surgery will have to be done. The
[1900.72] patient needs blood. Please
[1903.80] contact the blood bank. Thank
[1906.64] you. What did you say? Mummy was in her
[1910.16] seventh month, so what did you
[1913.08] forget? Maybe a premature birth is going to happen. The
[1919.60] doctor had forbidden it. He had told Mummy to take
[1923.08] bed rest.
[1925.68] But we did not take care of her at all.
[1930.75] [Music]
[1933.96] Bir, all this has happened because of Amtula aunty,
[1937.52] how can someone be so cruel? I have started
[1941.68] hating her face.
[1945.60] Why, how is aunty's health? What did the doctor say
[1950.61] [Music] that
[1951.84] blood is needed, the blood has gone
[1956.68] back, but I don't know
[1959.32] what will happen. I don't understand anything.
[1962.96] We have already discussed this.
[1966.20] Earlier, I thought pre-term birth is a normal thing at this age.
[1970.84] [Music]
[1973.88] Now I'm really sorry, he was just angry.
[1979.17] [Music]
[1981.32] So pray for mummy.
[1985.31] [Music]
[1987.01] [Praise]
[1989.92] [Music]
[2001.72] In premature delivery, there is a
[2004.56] risk to the life of both the mother and the child,
[2008.16] so why are you telling me this?
[2010.60] I know that
[2012.16] normal delivery does not happen at this age. If you knew, then
[2016.28] what was the need to call them to your house and
[2018.08] insult them like this.
[2021.04] I don't know why you are
[2023.68] so angry with those husband and wife. It is
[2026.12] their fault, isn't it that they are the
[2030.16] parents of the daughter who likes your son?
[2031.96] This is not a small mistake Afan sahab,
[2035.84] he took advantage of my innocence and simplicity.
[2041.04] Whatever insult was to happen in my circle was bound to
[2044.12] happen, but
[2046.48] I don't understand the motive of you people to hide this matter. By the way, I
[2052.04] learned to make a mountain out of a molehill from you. Brother, you punished her, you sent her
[2055.04] to the operation table, and what do you want?
[2058.72] And then becoming a mother at this age is
[2062.56] not such a big deal that you make it such a big issue.
[2064.20] You are making it an issue. If it were up to me,
[2067.56] I would banish them from the city. I have never seen a
[2070.00] liar and small person like Abrar in my entire life.
[2073.68] Thankfully,
[2076.08] everything came to light before Arham's marriage. This is too much
[2078.52] Afan, you also kept me in the dark
[2084.37] [Music]
[2092.60] Shata is bleeding a lot.
[2095.28] We will need more blood. Please
[2097.96] arrange it. I am unable to stop her bleeding.
[2099.52] Doctor, the patient's blood pressure is getting very
[2101.56] high.
[2103.04] 170. Please arrange the blood
[2105.96] [Music] Can
[2110.04] you take it quickly? [Music] [
