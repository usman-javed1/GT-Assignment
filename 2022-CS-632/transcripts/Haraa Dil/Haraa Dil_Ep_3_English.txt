Hara Dil Sajna Ve Hara Dil Sajna Ve [Music] Sajna Lane ji your soup is here hot it was time to come when you had to rest and I served you I do not remember ever seeing you lying on the bed with Abir and Momna I would just come to the hospital to see them, I do not remember if I ever held them in my lap you are right that unlike all other men you never held Momna and Aveer in your lap happily and now it seems as if your feet are not staying on the ground you are going to be the father of a son I am surprised at myself you had such a strong desire for a son and I never got to know about it yes so what is the fault in this you are unnecessarily doing drama of being emotional okay I had a desire for a son which Allah fulfilled [Music] I have never complained to you all my life if you had such a strong desire then you should have told me I would have arranged for your second marriage what useless things are you saying for two minutes Also think that the void of a brother is going to be filled in Momna and Abir's life [Sangeet] This brother will not become their support but will become a burden on them [Sangeet] At this age children are not normal but now normal children are born She is such a big doctor She was getting angry at me What nonsense are you talking about You are cruel and thankful women You do not know how to thank Allah We will not be dependent on anyone in our old age, right? Hey daughters, what was the point of sitting with you all our lives [Sangeet] [Sangeet] Many congratulations to both of you Son [Sangeet] You are [Sangeet] Momna everything will be fine [Sangeet] Where are you, you are not seen We met at the wedding and today you are working on a special project For me every project is special You tell me, have you fallen in love with this house I mean you are comfortable I am comfortable but this house is not new for me But why do I feel that because of me you are uncomfortable If you are feeling so then it must be right What should I start talking about?  The two of you have cooked I have cooked your favourite dish Start eating You have prepared your favourite dish on your timetable I am a guest why are you ruining my habit Jwar don't worry about it there is no chance of anyone's habit getting ruined here At the end only that happens here what Mama wants must happen to you because you don't use your brain [Music] Oh Oh, how are you talking to your sister [Music] Excuse me [Music] [Music] What does this have to do with your marriage You are afraid that we will leave you and go after getting married I will not go I will always stay with you I will do my job I will stay as you say I will just be with you Rangi please get yourself checked by a good doctor and get rid of this problem nothing can be done now I have already discussed all this with your father before talking to you it's too late and it's not so easy to end all this my condition is [Music] Look Baba is not worried about our mother he is worried about that son that son who is still  There is so much erasing in this world. I am unable to understand how to explain it to you. Ami, I care so much for you. Don't explain it to me, rather explain it to yourself. Now what was to happen has happened. [Sangeet] Gaya [Sangeet] What's the problem? Api, you neither sleep nor let others sleep. [Sangeet] Then has anything new happened? It's not new, but it has definitely become absurd. What's absurd? And have we brother made a plan to elope? I mean, this is what happens in these situations, in what situation? Your needle is still stuck there. My needle is stuck, your life is stuck. Api, how long will this go on like this? Ammi is also very worried. I had no idea. She is so tensed about your marriage. She has taken the tension herself. I mean, look, what is the need to have so many expectations from Aunty Tola [Sangeet] Well, there is one thing. If Arham bhai wants, then everything can be fine. I myself also don't want Arham to do anything. Now I don't want him to do anything at all. Go to sleep. [Sangeet] Okay, listen, at least turn off the light. I know the light.  I can't sleep. Always remember one thing. We have to speak very carefully in front of our younger brother because these are relationships of a husband and a wife. We should never reveal our weaknesses to them. Your son is sharing his weaknesses. I had no idea that the girl would take over Aram's mind in this way. [Music] Were you thinking it was a routine affair? Stop it. It was a routine affair which you encouraged. I feel very sorry for your thinking. I am also a father of a daughter. How can I think ill of someone else's daughter? And if Aariz deserves a good partner and a good home in her life, then why not Momna? You are comparing my Aariz with Momna. I am feeling sorry for your thinking and she has also started dreaming of a big house there. I am sorry Atul. Your approach is completely wrong. You always weigh relationships on the scale of wealth and I judge a person by his qualities. Momna has all those qualities which are enough for my son's happiness. And that's why I will support Arham You do whatever you want [Music] [Praise] [Music] Who is this Momina She is Haram's girlfriend and he wants to marry her She is a girlfriend Wow so when is the marriage Never never Never hey it's Arham's life what's the problem with you Baa What happened a while ago is your reaction to this never This might be my problem but it can never be your problem Please don't try to impose your so called philosophy on me I'm just asking you why are you liking it Mom and her family used to live in Annecy now it's obvious that Mumma is not going to make her her daughter in law There is a lot of tension going on because of that so does our Auntie Jaan also does charity work and that too at this level I'm quite impressed Mumma has no interest in charity This is a gift from our grandmother I thank Momna's father met her somewhere on the footpath then she brought her home She was found on the footpath how could a person pick her up like this and bring her home  There was a flood in those days and they lost everything. Why are you taking so much interest in all this? The matter is something like this [ Sangeet] [Sangeet] why did you get up? I was preparing breakfast and anyway, in this condition, you should take rest. You are feeling very happy, aren't you? After disrespecting your mother, leave this work to your father. You go and get ready. I am not sick that I can take rest. I agree that this change has come in my existence after many years, but I have enough courage to bear its burden. Don't be worried, I will not trouble you people. I will not put you in trouble. [Sangeet] change, change, not happiness [Sangeet] what happened, that's why it's fine. Come, I'll take you to the doctor. You are becoming weak day by day. You don't take care of yourself at all. Fear God, why are you torturing yourself? Now I'll take you to the doctor. Sit here. Now, what will the doctor do? Weakness in the head is inevitable. Yes, that's fine, but what happened, mummy, I am having a headache. Baba, take mummy to some good doctor.  Let's take him to a specialist or else we'll check what happened baba you were not that careless you are feeling dizzy baba lie down on the sofa I'll bring him here [Music] If you're not going to the doctor right now I'll bring hot milk for you [Music] [Music] what is this nonsense pregnancy report and mummy so much has happened and I don't even know relax what is this mummy I don't understand should I cry should I get angry what should I do you are so intelligent that how can you do this [Music] people will make fun of us so much why will they make fun of us the whole world has children and what is this unusual thing well I haven't seen anyone having children at this age at this age people get their children married if you say even one more word then no one will be worse than me I have committed a crime your mother and I would give birth to such ill mannered and ill-mannered daughters I never thought I didn't where was the deficiency in my upbringing it was probably because of us your deficiency was there In life, you have behaved rudely at this age, Abhir, come on, don't create a scene in the room, come on, it has already created a scene, when people will laugh at us, you will silence them and that Atul aunty, she wants a chance to talk about us, Abhir, stop it, it's a matter of three-four months, this image will be ruined, it will feel so good here, come, congratulations, my mother is about to deliver, for God's sake, shut up now, don't do this, you people, I will eat something and die after hearing all this [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] Aaram, till when will you keep spoiling the atmosphere of my house because of that girl, last night you did it in front of the brother, he did n't give you money, what would he be thinking, and it doesn't matter to me what he would be thinking, it should matter, Aaram, it's a question of my sister's respect and happiness, so how many people in this house are concerned about my happiness and as far as respect is concerned, mama you don't see anyone else's respect in front of you, whatever you said at Momna's house  He didn't even give you pocket money. So Momna complained to my son about his mother. Stupid boys like you are the ones who make the lives of middle class girls like these. Otherwise such girls stay at home all their lives. The whole family is fooling you Arham and you are becoming a fool. That Abrar Hasan doesn't even have the manners to talk. And I should establish a relationship with them, that too of my only son. Fine, you can do whatever your heart desires, but I will not be a part of any of your requested programs. In fact, I will close this topic of marriage. I do n't want to get married. I am going to Canada after my exams. I don't want to stay here. [Sangeet] Amma's health is not well at all. [Sangeet] It is not right to take tension about her in this condition. You were telling her as if it was all her fault. Does any woman knowingly become a mother? Why didn't she know about her mistake? You should have gone to a good doctor [Sangeet] She died, there is no benefit in dying. [Sangeet] She is the son's  She is going to be a mother [sangeet] and this is the biggest happiness of Baba's life, whether it is a son or a daughter, at this age our parents were fond of being made fun of and you see, Aapi that Amtula aunty who is firm on your principles, when she comes to know, then listen and bear your insult, Arham bhai is also trying in vain to convince them, it is not in our fate, friend, a good home and a good family, please Abir, now keep quiet, whatever is in my fate will happen, do n't burn your heart and I am not burning mine by talking like this, Aapi I am talking sensibly [sangeet] before the world comes to know what is going on in our house, you get married and go from here, this is better for you [sangeet] later the son will come, who will ask about us in this house [sangeet] f mamma why are you saying the same thing to me again and again, if Momina is important for me, then your happiness is more important than that, I don't know how all this will happen, but whenever it will happen, it will happen with your happiness Son, marriage is not a companionship of two or four days, it is a commitment for the whole life See, there aren't so many differences between them and us, so believe me I wouldn't have been so adamant We have our own image They have their own life style, there is a lot of difference between the two Aram, believe me one day these things will irritate you, they will never irritate me Mama these commitments are also made from the heart, otherwise the same old compromise Be reasonable Aram There should be something that forces me to agree to your point Mama Momna Momina Momina has all those things that I want in my life partner She is really very good She can easily carry on our lifestyle And then no marriage is perfect [Sangeet] Sometimes the classes do not match, sometimes the thoughts and happiness is achieved by meeting the thoughts This is the question of my happiness [Sangeet] Wait I am I For your happiness it is so difficult for me to even think of going to Abrar Hasan's house Anyways you have definitely liked Momna Ram, but she will have to live her life in my way Please explain to her why she didn't live her life according to you Gujri thank you very much ya I l [Music] Look Bhabhi we have not come to repeat the past we have come to revive the happiness which is connected with the lives of our children so it's okay Bhaisahab but how can all this happen so soon look the children have already decided that if we don't listen to them then they can take any step well leave these things these things will keep happening if I am not feeling right then it's okay get yourself tested you got all the tests done by your doctor everything is fine how can someone call sugar blood pressure a disease without doing anything it can happen to anyone nowadays well now if you just sit idle nothing happens this is a disease that is found in the body definitely someone else in your family will have it first look I had told you not to listen to what I said if we keep giving up our self like this then the happiness of our children will die or I just have one request to you that now it's okay to tell you the old things but what is the need to go through all this formality or right now just  If we had talked, that would have been fine. Where is the formality or what is right and wrong Abrar. I do n't want to get into this judgment. I just want that there should be no shortage of any kind in my son's wedding. That's why today we will go after fixing the date and also deciding the menu and the venue. [Sangeet] Brother, I believe that every good work should start with something sweet. Here, Bhabhi, sweeten your mouth. Please, just sweeten your mouth. After that, we will drink tea made by you. Here, brother, you also eat. [Sangeet] Thank you. Do you know what is the best part of our friendship? We understand each other's words without even saying them. We do n't make fun of each other's compulsions. If that were the case, the hope of staying together would have vanished long ago. To stay together, support is necessary. You have accepted defeat already. I do n't want to lose by winning [Sangeet] We can ignore aunty's thinking, not her decision. You should agree with her. I have accepted her words. Momina, I don't have any other option. [Sangeet] But I will miss this friend of mine a lot, who makes me positive.  She asks me to stay and it is written in big letters on her face that Ram, I have no complaints about life without you, so I will get used to living without you anyway, life gives a new excuse at every turn to stay alive, so how would you feel living without me? No, I have n't thought about it yet, when will I think about it after your marriage? [Music] Thank you, won't you ask me to have tea for the last time? Obviously, from tomorrow I will be busy with my wedding preparations. The van will come to pick and drop you too [Music] Yes [Music] Yes, look, whether you are in a hurry or not, but if it is in my control to get us married, then I will take Momina home as my daughter-in-law next week, and that's why I want that whatever date I fix should be finalized [Music] [Music] That's it [Music] Oh my God Arham Bhai, it's a surprise, brother, you will have to accept that this means that you have won the hearts of both you and Amal aunty. Good [Music] Job [Music] There has been a joke between you and Arham till now, but now your relationship is changing and I really like the joke of relationships. No, now you are going to become the daughter-in-law of our house, let me tell you one thing, I would never want that in front of me anyone should let down my son's wife or taunt her for being middle class and sub-standard [Music] Bhabhi, if there has been any negligence in my upbringing, please forgive it, I have never let my daughters feel the hot air of the situation and in future too I will leave these people to their fate [Music] Congratulations to you [Music] people [Praise] Saj Saj [Praise] [Music] Saj I got impressed by Arham Bhai, I did not know that he is so romantic, you should watch these films less and we do not need to be too impressed by Lanti, did not see the whole lecture of his, hey, it is just the beginning, when this story will be known, then the sky will be raised on our heads, you should tell Arham Bhai, he did not tell him, he was yours, then what do I tell, I do not have the courage, you are practical friend, anyway, do Arne Prove  Diya na, now you should also support them. Bring some food, I have to cook. What nonsense is this? Hello, you made up your mind, but you are busy with your sister. Be kind and call me after some time. You have a very long life, oh brother. By the way, tell me one thing, your comfort and peace, everything remains in our house. How do you feel about this achievement of yours? What should I tell you? Sometimes it feels to me as if half of my life will be spent in making Mama happy and the other half in making her happy. I feel something like this. Just choice yours, Bhaijaan, now tell me where are you throwing the party? Let's go for an ice cream. I am coming towards you in a while. You guys are ready. ok done. get ready, why [Sangeet] abhi [Sangeet] what has happened now, now everything is out, okay, I agree that the intrust that was there between you and me earlier, does n't let us be happy [Sangeet] but you are still not happy. What 's the matter, it is clearly visible from your eyes. Last night also, you were avoiding me deliberately, weren't you?  What you see and what you hear is not always the truth, then what's the issue Hey yaar I'm really sorry, your mother, is there any problem? Seriously, you people also keep taking her to the hospitals in the neighborhood, let me do one thing, tomorrow I will take her to some specialist, get her tests done, whatever the problem is, it will come out, listen, I am not doing any favor, it is her right on me, when you say you, then what should I tell you, what I feel, I am trying, can we fully live up to the style of la aunty, that conversation between you and mum, I want the same Momina whom I know, share one thing [Sangeet] Sajana, the same thing which you have not shared till date, which is perhaps more important than that, what's the matter, why are you asking me riddles, tell me what's the matter, hey [Sangeet] my mother is pregnant [Sangeet]
