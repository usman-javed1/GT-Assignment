[0.20] Hara Dil Sajna ve Hara Dil Sajna
[6.36] ve
[12.00] Sajna I don't know how to apply it but it's not coming off
[14.76] friend oh oh what are you doing
[17.92] rubbing a child's eyes like this is very
[20.64] delicate oh god the nails
[22.84] can get infected in fact even before taking him in your lap you should
[24.76] wash your hands properly and just
[27.44] look at this such a dirty towel is a
[30.64] very bad thing
[32.12] you have here at this time oh I
[36.16] suddenly come anywhere at any time
[38.28] by the luck of the children give it to me I will clean it thank you thank you I am
[46.52] very sorry I
[49.48] came suddenly like this I came to Jeba's house then
[52.68] when I called Jeba I came to know that she has
[54.80] gone out for some work she is about to come on the way
[57.52] and my car suddenly
[61.16] broke down I parked it outside your door
[63.92] now if this rain stops then something will happen
[67.84] now your dupatta is getting all wet
[71.20] I will give you Shagufta's sheet and
[73.72] give me this key I will cross the car left or right I am
[75.88] not parked anywhere on the road oh no no don't
[77.52] worry at all the car is
[79.32] Jeba  She is standing outside the door of her house. Let
[81.16] the rain stop and then you will see. You have made
[84.60] my problem easy. Anyway,
[87.36] all these things are in my bag. I have kids
[89.52] but you know that I
[91.56] work in the hospital and the whole day is
[93.36] spent with the kids so I have to keep everything. I will
[98.56] make tea for you. If Shufta
[102.44] were here, I would have taken care of you in a better way. Don't be formal
[104.56] at all, I would be craving for
[107.04] tea, I will tell you myself.
[109.40] What love. You also have two daughters,
[113.60] where are they? Can't you see? Has she gone out? The
[117.24] elder daughter
[121.16] studies in my university. She comes home a little late these days.
[124.72] Poor Abhir was mother's favourite. Ever
[130.28] since Shagufta left, she has kept quiet
[135.80] with her. Don't leave your daughters alone. It's an
[137.96] emotional age and on top of that, this shock. You
[141.20] know, children do
[143.88] any wrong thing when they get emotional.
[146.28] Keep the girls under your watch. I do
[151.28] n't know that Shufta has taken all the happiness of this house
[154.64] with her.
[161.52] Ana, there used to be
[164.56] a lot of joy and
[167.64] happiness.  There was a time in this house,
[181.76] Salam Walekum Walekum
[185.28] Salam I have seen a lot of this grief, sorrow, tears,
[189.40] whose voice is coming, if these things are said, then
[191.12] believe me
[192.88] Baba, it doesn't seem like Seba Aunty's,
[197.16] Baba's son's nanny told me that there is a
[201.24] nurse,
[202.44] Jeba Aunty's best friend and Baba's
[206.60] best
[207.68] friend What is happening in this house, you
[212.92] were not like this after Ammi left, Baba what is Baba's fault in this, we are
[218.96] also habituated,
[225.40] we left the doors of our house
[228.72] open for others, people have a habit,
[234.00] Api, now there is no use in closing the doors,
[237.92] Baba has become addicted to seeking sympathy from people, he would be
[240.92] sitting in front of everyone and telling
[243.80] that their daughters are angry with them, since
[255.00] when has she been coming, this is Seba Aunty's friend, I don't know,
[259.04] Kaser has come and told me the whole story,
[262.08] that too is a moving drama, I do
[264.44] n't know what all she would be talking about us while sitting in front of people,
[271.80] I will go and see
[272.98] [Music], that's
[278.56] enough, a person goes away and memories are a
[283.16] cruel thing, they find a
[284.76] place in every corner of the house  I would have made a promise and sat down
[288.64] but I say that she is very
[291.20] lucky who is still living in your heart and this
[294.76] house.
[296.40] This relationship is such that
[300.24] if there is no place in the heart, I think
[302.52] even the biggest luxurious houses start looking desolate.
[307.72] Shagufta
[309.76] supported me in my bad times
[312.76] and I have spent good times with her too.
[315.92] But if Abraj sahab keeps remembering the old things,
[319.80] how will new happiness be seen?
[323.32] I have seen you a lot of sorrow, pain and tears. Now
[328.08] when such things happen, believe me, the heart starts getting
[330.24] nervous and the health gets worse.
[333.12] Assalam waaleikum waaleikum asalam. Sorry
[336.68] baba, I am a little late. You must
[340.00] not have asked the guest for tea.
[342.20] Momna, this is Fahmi
[345.14] [sangeet].
[348.96] Now, there is Woba aunty, isn't she her friend.
[353.12] This hospital is for children. There is
[355.92] a lot of healing in her hands.
[359.56] Our Sami gets completely
[361.72] fine as soon as we go to her. Oh,
[363.80] let it be, just see how beautiful she is.
[367.44] Brother, I was very keen to meet you.
[369.12] I have heard a lot of praises of you. Let's
[371.12] rain today.  We have met outside,
[373.36] hey, if you want to sit here, then come and sit next to me,
[375.80] your father did not tell me properly
[377.44] who I am, I will tell you, she is
[379.60] your Zeba aunty, actually she used to
[381.24] live in our neighborhood and then
[383.28] I had also done my nursing course with her, so there was
[384.88] a bit of a senior-junior thing,
[387.40] but don't tell her in front of her that she was
[389.60] senior to me, she gets angry immediately on every thing, by the way
[391.64] Abrar sahab, she is such a beautiful
[394.44] girl, has her marriage been fixed or
[397.00] not, may Allah grant her heaven, her mother had
[400.76] fixed it in her lifetime itself, that's good,
[404.48] Mashallah, this is a very good thing, look,
[406.92] I have
[409.24] so many things to think about her in just one minute, you have some tea, I will
[412.48] go and prepare dinner, you will go after
[415.52] eating, oh no, no
[417.44] son, don't be formal at all, I have to
[419.60] reach the hospital, your Zeba
[421.40] aunty is waiting for her, when she will
[423.52] come, I will go with her, stay happy,
[426.32] very sweet
[427.92] girl, sahab, Mashallah, what a wonderful upbringing
[430.52] you have given to the child
[438.35] [Music]
[444.57] [Music]
[448.32] Thank you
[449.75] [Music]
[460.65] [Music]
[471.57] [Applause]
[473.73] [Music]
[477.04] Hey, why are you calling me again and again? There is
[480.12] no use in repeating anything. It will
[482.36] waste my time and your
[485.20] energy. Shut up mam, listen to me and don't
[487.80] disconnect the call. I want to meet you.
[489.84] I am coming home right now. I don't
[491.28] need any excuse.
[496.36] Understand? It's very strange. She does
[499.84] n't want to meet you and you are going crazy for her.
[504.00] You haven't come out of the drama of NC yet. I
[508.24] feel like leaving her to
[512.04] her own devices. Move on, rest, do you go
[515.12] back to your home? I mean your own home
[518.16] where you are only
[519.44] interested in your life. Don't interfere in anyone else's life.
[530.98] [Music]
[536.36] Hey, what are you doing? Will you
[540.72] leave the house just because Arham says so? Keep
[543.00] all this back. So, it's not like this is my home.
[546.16] I am leaving your and Arham's house
[548.72] and until my house is built, I will
[551.28] stay in a hotel. I ca
[553.44] n't stay here to be insulted.  She
[555.48] repeatedly threatens to leave the house, one
[558.16] day these threats fall on her own people, I am
[560.24] already tired of Arham's dramas, don't create any
[562.72] new drama, you have fed up with
[565.72] Arham a lot, he scolds me whenever he wants,
[568.36] but you will
[570.84] not say anything to him, everything I say will
[572.92] seem like a drama to you, what has happened, put all this
[576.20] back, stupid girl, I don't know when you will come to your senses,
[580.00] stupid, it's not me, it's you, in what
[583.64] tone are you talking to me, I am
[585.96] your mother, you are not my mother,
[587.68] beware, if you use this tone again, he would
[590.08] say something,
[593.16] how insulted you were by those people there, but neither did
[595.52] their friendship end, nor is Aram going to leave her,
[597.92] he will leave her very soon, believe
[599.92] me,
[603.24] how can you believe so much, he has just gone to meet her,
[607.52] I am not stupid like you, you
[611.48] see Momna, you will
[614.48] never marry Arham, are
[617.40] you dreaming about Fiza,
[620.84] your interest in someone's coming and going is
[623.60] without any reason  So it can't be possible Mama she is
[627.40] Jwar's sister and Jwar
[630.40] is very emotional about his sister ok now leave all these things
[634.04] and listen to me carefully
[638.76] Aram can do anything for your happiness
[642.80] keep all this
[645.67] [Music]
[656.15] [Music] take it
[658.04] back
[659.96] Fai Allah what was the need to do all this
[663.20] oh what did
[666.36] I do
[668.52] ok be grateful for this rain and
[672.64] what about me I took you on a tour of Abrar bhai's house
[675.24] ok did my words come to your mind
[678.56] or did you hear it with one ear and let it
[680.64] out from the other as it has always been your habit ah
[684.92] you know that my mind is always
[686.64] disturbed and I listen to other people's words with one
[689.24] ear and let it out from the other you crazy
[691.16] this is of use to you ok you have
[693.92] seen Abrar bhai's house from inside how
[695.92] big it is and the most important thing is that it is your own house
[699.52] neither worry about rent nor about expenses
[703.00] see even with two jobs you will be saved you are
[706.76] right your
[710.24] Abrar bhai is very nice
[712.56] but his daughters are very
[716.92] smart they are
[717.96] full of energy and these are baba's
[721.80] ladli daughters  She never
[724.00] tolerates another woman, she will not agree,
[727.08] now Ra sahab should get married, by the way,
[730.76] tell me one thing, why are both these girls sitting at home till now,
[732.88] they should have had their own homes by now,
[734.44] see Mamna was getting
[737.84] married, her in-
[740.32] laws created such a hurry, Shagufta died
[743.20] half in this grief, then she passed away, so the
[746.84] matter cooled down
[749.35] [sangeet] it would have been
[753.80] better if both of them had got married, they will get
[757.12] married, and anyway,
[760.72] who makes young girls sit at home for so long, as far as the
[763.80] question is about the child, he will be
[766.60] yours forever, now in this time, there is no possibility of you
[769.24] having a child, why can't
[771.28] I give birth to a child, when your neighbor can give
[773.28] birth to a child at this age, then
[774.72] what is my fault, she must be at least 20 years
[776.80] older than me, she can give birth to a child,
[783.00] well, I am a little scared na Jeba, that I might get
[787.72] trapped after getting married, looking after every
[789.84] house, looking after the children, looking after the house,
[793.64] I cannot do all this, freedom has its
[797.48] own fun,
[799.52] see,
[802.88] funny, there comes an age that  When we do
[806.76] n't need a man's company but his support
[810.50] [Praise]
[811.44] [Music] Should I get
[815.80] married? Yes, yes, get married. Now you see
[820.32] how much Abrar Bhai respects his wife. He will
[823.36] sit on his head in respect to you. May
[827.44] Allah bless
[829.80] you with the samosa. You eat the samosa I had
[834.04] ordered for you.
[840.68] [Music]
[854.96] I know you all are very angry with me
[857.74] [Music]
[859.32] But son, remember one thing.
[865.24] All our intentions are fulfilled only
[871.32] when Allah's will is involved. [
[877.15] Music]
[882.48] Aasha Ufta is not with me
[886.01] [Music]
[892.28] But her
[895.88] happiness, her dreams are with me, right?
[901.80] [Music]
[905.52] If I
[906.80] complete her unfinished work, then
[913.72] she will also get peace,
[922.84] right? Uncle, I am with you. I have
[926.84] already said sorry on Mama's behalf. I
[929.76] want to apologize once again
[934.63] [Music]
[937.80] Uncle, Momina is living very lonely.
[943.16] I want to make her happy.
[948.36] I can't make this promise to myself.
[954.44] Please talk to Momina
[957.60] and leave her alone.
[961.44] [Music] The one who has
[964.96] gone once, doesn't come back
[968.31] [Music]
[970.76] But the happiness that we have  It is in our fate at
[974.24] least she should not go out of our hands
[978.46] [Music]
[981.20] no, you please talk to her once

[1359.48] both of them were at home, I have just come from there a while
[1362.24] ago, Sunny was sleeping and
[1364.68] Kausar was watching TV, the fitter was also very dirty,
[1367.64] I have scolded Sami and come now, you have called
[1371.48] Kausar, she might have taken Sami out,
[1374.84] she is very fond of roaming around, I did not call you,
[1377.68] you come with me,
[1380.64] yes, I will come, I will come wearing a sheet,
[1382.44] okay, I am coming

[1398.90] [Music]
[1402.84] [Praise]
[1416.09] [Music]
[1424.04] We searched a lot but could not find her anywhere,
[1427.40] but I am surprised that how did you keep a maid
[1429.24] for such a small child without any investigation,
[1431.32] that child is speechless, I
[1434.40] cannot tell anything, what could I do, my
[1437.32] helplessness,
[1439.04] Abrar should also not be worried, I have told Azam
[1441.96] and have gone to find out the address of Kausar's house, she must be
[1444.32] coming, aunty ji, ch ch ch
[1451.99] [Music]
[1458.11] [Music] Let's
[1466.80] go,
[1469.92] listen, Salam Walekum ji, this is locked, where have
[1473.36] these people gone here, oh brother, his stuff was brought in the
[1476.24] morning  She left just a little while
[1478.20] ago,
[1480.36] she took away their child,
[1485.56] this is a great injustice, why don't you do this,
[1489.40] her husband is a driver in some bungalow in the neighborhood, find out from
[1490.96] him, this is all we
[1493.76] know, what is her husband,
[1499.04] she was saying that she is a widow and she has
[1501.28] small children, sister,
[1503.80] her husband earns a lot, go ahead and
[1507.08] find out, he works as a driver, I
[1509.56] think Abraaj sahab, we should go to the police station immediately, a
[1511.84] lot of time has been wasted here, oh
[1514.92] God, where will I find my child now, the
[1518.24] police will do something, now you go to the police station, help
[1521.80] [music],
[1530.84] you take leave, it was
[1533.52] not so important for you to go to college,
[1536.40] your regular classes are not being held these days, so
[1538.24] what was the issue,
[1541.88] you know
[1545.28] what the situation is inside Baba's office, what the situation is,
[1546.84] he has been fired from his job,
[1550.84] we both have to together give him relief from home, it is a
[1554.56] compulsion and but that child, Aapi, please
[1558.88] friend, I have no interest in living a helpless life like you,
[1561.64] my studies and my college  It is
[1564.32] more important than that child and
[1566.48] you are very fond of raising this beloved child of Baba, right?
[1568.64] So raise it and leave your
[1571.00] university. You have become extremely rude.
[1575.36] Now you are not rude, I have become sensible. I have gained wisdom.
[1579.32] Life cannot be
[1582.00] spent being emotional. And when every person
[1584.52] decides to be happy, then he does
[1586.40] not give attention to anyone. And then he should
[1589.52] bear the burden of his decisions himself. Be
[1593.04] happy, both of you have gone.
[1597.44] Sami was a burden, I have borne it for both of you. No
[1600.92] one else will trouble you
[1604.36] both. Go, go, well done Abhir. Take rest. No
[1609.48] one will cry.
[1612.52] Baba, what are you saying in this house?
[1615.72] How can Kausar do this?
[1621.28] She had been coming here for so many days. It is
[1624.00] obvious that when she saw that she has no
[1626.12] heir, no one will cry for her,
[1628.60] she found an opportunity and took him away. She does
[1630.92] not know in which cruel person's hands
[1633.96] my poor Sami must be. Go, go, celebrate.
[1646.52] Go,
[1655.80] Papa, there is a bad news. What happened?
[1659.64] He is Abrar uncle's son kidnapped.  It has happened, they had hired a

[1827.80] Fahmi, just pray that Allah brings good news
[1830.88] Abrar Bhai went to the police station The ill-fated woman was
[1835.28] not the mother of the children, this was her only job Well,
[1838.20] by the way, tell me why is your Abrar Bhai
[1841.36] so simple  Or did he make some mistake,
[1844.40] what nonsense have I been talking to you for so many days, he is a
[1847.84] very decent man, he does
[1852.16] n't know the high and low of today's times, may
[1855.20] Allah grant him heaven, it was he who took
[1857.56] care of Shagufta at home, otherwise she is
[1859.96] Allah Miya's cow, well should I
[1862.88] call him Allah Miya's bull, by the way,
[1865.80] I have also started to sympathize a little with your Abrar bhai,
[1868.48] now it is obvious that if he is
[1871.80] sad, then I too won't be able to sleep tonight, right? By the
[1875.04] way, you supported him a lot, I was

[1883.68] bhai is our own, well, it's okay, there is
[1887.32] no need to make a lot of fun, that sahab was
[1892.88] looking a bit too close to Abraaj sahab and his son also seems to be a very sexy
[1895.76] party, tell me from where did you get trapped,
[1898.92] hey, he is Momna's future father-in-law, he is a
[1902.64] very nice man, he takes a lot of care of Mamna, it's
[1905.36] just that his wife's mind doesn't match, she is a
[1909.12] very bad-minded woman, he
[1912.12] should be, bad-minded brother, it is right to be proud,
[1915.68] Allah has given him so much,
[1918.04] well  Come on, leave it, you take care of yourself.
[1920.12] Yes, we will talk a lot tomorrow. Come on, I will also go to
[1922.40] sleep. Allah

[2019.76] and [
[2027.42] Music] you could not take care of an innocent life. [Music]
[2030.68] I always kept you like a flower
[2035.00] and what did you do that
[2040.28] my time is in the dilemma between life and death?
[2048.00] What have you done son?
[2050.86] [Music]
[2056.20] How have you treated me? There was
[2064.12] definitely something lacking in my love
[2068.57] [Music]
[2071.28] When you people left
[2075.56] loving Nemi far away
[2077.96] [Music] you did
[2080.40] not even take care of him considering him a human being
[2085.00] [Music]
[2091.88] Hum
[2095.40] sam sam my
[2098.88] brother, I am sorry
