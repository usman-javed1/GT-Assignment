[159.28] Faraz has come I will go and see
[176.28] [Music]
[186.32] Whom have you come to meet Abrar Bhai is
[189.60] no more in this world Oh, well you have
[193.28] come from his office,
[200.00] right? How will it be?
[204.48] I don't know How will it be? There has been such a big loss. Brother, let's go inside and talk. It does
[208.84] n't feel good to talk at the door. Come on,
[219.04] you also come inside and see, he wo
[223.08] n't feel bad. Come, let's introduce you well.
[238.12] I knew that you can win anyone's heart
[240.28] and you can play the band of anyone like this,
[244.80] so I never thought of this. There is no
[247.36] need to be impressed.
[249.88] When I get angry, I do
[252.32] n't treat anyone well.
[255.48] What is the need to keep such a big anger on this small nose?
[257.96] You had come to help me, right? You weren't you.
[262.00] Why am I saying this? I will
[264.60] explain later. Or if we want to
[267.56] discuss about your father, then let's
[274.68] go ma'am. Abrar Bhai's daughters are
[279.24] very lucky and there is a great family, a lot of money,
[284.80] but his heart got stuck in Momna and
[289.24] now this is the other one who is touching the skies.
[292.76] And there is my wretched girl Nala, she is simple and foolish, how could
[296.52] any
[299.56] decent proposal come for her Hey look
[302.76] Jeba, these boys from high class families, they don't get
[305.76] married, they just
[308.32] fool the girls like this and their
[310.64] choice is free thinking and the most stupid
[313.60] girls, so that even if there is some high and low, then there is no
[319.08] one to come after these poor girls
[320.88] I have solved many such cases,
[328.48] all the traces of sin are cleared because of me,
[332.16] repent, what have you got into,
[336.08] apologize to Allah, it is a big sin,
[339.12] Fahmi, you know, oh oh oh, it is a big
[341.96] sin and why should I think, will the
[344.92] environment change if I think so, those who are committing crimes should
[347.24] think, I only
[349.32] wash away the sins of people, now see, she
[352.96] left the house saying she was going to college, she did not bring her
[355.12] slipper with her, if it was my Nala, I
[359.00] swear I would not have even let her enter the house, let it be, if it
[364.28] comes to my daughter, no one can do anything and
[367.24] me too  I will wait for two-four days only, see how I will pull you
[371.04] out of the house by holding your hair and make you stand there, so do
[375.64] n't make this mistake, don't you
[379.24] know Abrar bhai is respected a lot in the locality, if you create such a drama then
[381.96] those people will
[385.32] leave you, otherwise I don't have any respect
[388.00] in the locality, she
[390.48] will do whatever she wants, I will not see the
[393.72] people of the locality also, you eat guava, forget
[396.88] all the talks, never
[398.88] listen to me carefully, just let it be, these
[401.92] days Keenu has become very bad, otherwise it doesn't
[405.12] seem that your baba has been targeted,
[408.32] this seems like a street crime
[411.56] and to close such cases, the
[414.72] police have many jawans, there is
[417.88] IG, but we do
[424.52] n't meet them, now you will have to meet
[428.32] them, let's go, if you are saying, then I will definitely
[430.76] meet
[436.20] Abir, go and bring tea for them
[440.60] [Music]
[448.32] Come,
[453.28] you want to talk to me, will
[460.20] you marry Abir,
[467.40] no, after baba's whim, if
[473.00] during this time you take your parents here  If
[475.64] he comes, it will be better I don't have
[478.24] any problem with this relationship and as far as
[480.40] my Mama is concerned, I know her,
[482.88] she won't have any problem either
[487.64] and if you change, then
[491.72] I don't believe in talking but in proving it
[495.48] What are you trying to prove, my
[497.96] Aapi has
[499.24] proved it, she has
[502.28] come here on your one call only
[503.73] [Sangeet] Those who are
[505.12] true do
[509.32] n't come through the backdoor

[548.00] far as I think

[552.00] negative impact on your life
[553.03] [Sangeet]
[559.68] Today for the first time I took him in my lap,
[569.92] this
[570.87] [Sangeet]
[572.00] brother of ours took away all the happiness from your life and those who brought him into this world considering him as the support of his old age are
[577.24] no more in this world
[580.76] Life is such that here a person thinks something and
[585.20] something else happens, I do
[587.32] n't know what is going to happen in my and your life

[675.24] habit of drinking hot milk before sleeping after taking medicines at night
[677.68] otherwise my BP gets low my
[679.84] health becomes very bad should
[682.84] I bring it
[689.96] but Baba used to make you spend all the money
[692.00] I don't have any money at all whatever
[695.64] little money I had I have spent it on
[697.72] stuff look brother as soon as your father left you put all the
[701.44] blame on me
[703.52] what do you think I have taken over your father's
[706.76] property I don't have
[709.44] any other work wife you must
[712.68] know your father very well
[715.80] how miserly his father was your father used to
[719.00] give money after counting it so wife I do
[721.84] n't have anything it was all in your father's
[723.80] pocket now God knows where it has
[730.52] gone [Music]  Look, don't talk about Baba,
[735.44] what have I told you, I am just
[739.08] saying that Baba used to give
[740.80] you money for expenses, so do one thing,
[743.76] take off your shoe and hit me on the head, do
[747.16] n't grab my hair and throw me out of the house, no, the
[749.32] money is spent, come on, tell me what to do, I don't do
[753.32] anything, I
[757.76] starve, I sit and sit, it doesn't make any difference, it's
[759.76] obvious, I don't get ration from the neighbors, don't
[761.84] sit and sit, there's no
[765.20] need to tell me so much, I was
[768.04] good, I was living a luxurious life even without marriage, I
[771.24] also used to work in my own house, I had a
[773.28] wish to raise a child, but after coming here, the trouble
[776.52] fell on me, now
[778.84] how will I raise these three people, a trouble has fallen on
[781.32] me, I am sitting in Iddat, I feel
[783.92] ashamed, if I get out of Iddat, then
[786.20] go and do some job and
[788.28] feed all of you, from where will I get
[790.72] money now, Baba used to respect the guests who came to the house,
[793.48] if you cannot respect them, then
[795.56] at least keep quiet, he has gone away
[798.00] Thank God that they left our house, they
[801.56] are guests, wife, they are good for an hour or two,
[804.88] these people who come and settle here for five hours,
[807.84] who will they be and from where has this
[810.64] homeless life started, you people don't even have
[812.92] any elder, I don't understand, to
[816.76] whom should I go and complain, if there was someone in the family, I would have seen
[821.20] how you people show all these symptoms,
[825.04] if you were a family, then you would not have been in this house because the
[828.64] elders of the house are the ones who
[830.88] stop the elders from doing bad,
[834.52] this sister of yours talks a lot, I don't know
[837.80] what your mother had to eat, she just does
[840.08] n't accept defeat, this girl,
[844.36] see, I am respecting you a lot, it will be
[848.36] better for you also that you
[851.36] take my mother's name with respect,
[854.92] why should I do this, I respect your mother
[859.56] and what did I say to her by abusing her
[862.44] that you felt so bad, oh
[866.20] Allah, I will
[871.64] pull the ground from under your feet, she will
[874.52] remember it all her life, you do
[876.04] n't feel ashamed, ha ha, break it, it is
[879.48] your father's only, you are
[881.60] throwing everything and showing me your style, it
[886.08] as if I don't know
[888.28] all this  Aren't you ashamed It's gone
[892.68] cold,
[895.56] who will
[897.68] eat it
[914.63] [Music]
[929.87] [Music] Can I
[944.64] tell you one thing now? I don't think that
[950.96] your Baba's second wife's
[953.52] behaviour did not look good to me. I
[960.44] mean that the entry of a new family member
[967.56] could also be made a part of the police investigation.
[969.04] I never thought about it. I know
[972.36] that your grief is very big.
[974.48] But despite that,
[978.00] instead of sitting at home and crying, you want to do something for your Baba.
[981.60] Your aggressive approach will make our relationship
[984.32] very strong.
[986.88] Our relationship,
[990.08] yes, what I have decided with Momna, do you mind it? Can it be
[995.60] wrong?
[998.48] You are very aggressive and
[1001.08] complicated
[1002.48] too. Let's go to the police station. I
[1006.52] want to keep this case separate from my desire.
[1007.97] [Music] I
[1011.84] 'm inside
[1014.02] [Music]
[1017.48] Come on [
[1032.89] Music]
[1086.04] Everything's okay, are you? I do
[1090.64] n't know what happened. Looking at you, it seems as if
[1094.68] you had no interest in coming shopping with me. In
[1099.36] fact, it is clearly written on your face
[1102.68] that even though you are with me, you are not with me
[1106.11] [Music]
[1110.69] [Music]
[1116.80] I feel that we could be happy together too
[1122.16] soon I did it too soon
[1126.32] but I could not finish my conversation I
[1136.72] feel that we should give some time to our relationship
[1147.28] Not us, it's you
[1153.28] Hey, I don't know about you
[1157.88] but I have
[1160.56] never even thought about any other girl in my life except you It's not that
[1165.80] other girls did
[1168.76] not want to come into my life
[1170.31] [Sangeet]
[1172.40] But I have
[1178.20] always waited only for you Well, I can understand this thing That it is not
[1180.72] that easy to ignore you I will
[1183.96] accept this thing only when you
[1186.84] stop ignoring me I used to
[1190.44] think that you were very practical If I was
[1193.16] not practical then I would have been sitting with you right now
[1197.24] here Yes, that's true as well Okay,
[1201.00] you won, I lost
[1205.43] [Sangeet]
[1208.80] I definitely like you to win
[1214.40] But I really like good people
[1220.79] [Sangeet] Do
[1227.16] you think that
[1229.92] I will run away from my responsibilities Is that the
[1234.84] problem
[1238.00] I want to
[1243.28] become your priority in your responsibility
[1249.76] [Sangeet]
[1255.72] Forget it I think
[1259.00] we should go because you had no
[1261.04] interest in coming with me anyway You were not interested in
[1262.84] anything  You will not eat it, does it matter to you
[1268.06] [music] Now
[1276.28] you have got time to come to me,
[1279.64] I have seen your Bir with some other
[1281.28] boy,
[1283.16] what is this affair going on outside, tell me the truth,
[1285.96] Khala, you too are not doing anything with me,
[1288.40] now I will marry such a girl
[1290.60] who is having an affair with someone else before marriage,
[1292.24] hey, stop crying, he is
[1296.32] some nephew of IG, DIG, she is
[1298.64] roaming around with him, he is helping in Abrar sahab's case,
[1301.32] these policemen are not anyone's
[1303.92] own, Khala and I don't like it that
[1306.16] she keeps getting upset with the police station and court
[1308.36] and what do you do at home
[1311.32] all day, Khala, you are not able to handle such a small girl,
[1313.92] you are of no use,
[1315.80] Khala, hey, such a small
[1319.04] girl, where is she from, she is so big, she
[1321.68] talks a lot and why does she go and ask me,
[1324.32] who am I to her, what do they call her, her late father's
[1327.76] wife, widow, yes the same
[1332.52] widow, I am always scared, I don't know when
[1335.84] these people will grab my ears and throw me out of the house  They will throw me out and make me
[1337.32] stand there Neither am I able to bear the pain nor take the house
[1345.11] [Sangeet] I will get the
[1353.52] papers of the house transferred in your name Give it to
[1356.68] me Give me your wife You are a
[1360.00] widow

[1371.61] [Sangeet]
[1372.76] but what is the
[1375.56] issue

[1379.76] papers have neither Abrar saheb
[1384.24] 's name nor
[1386.80] mine On them there is the name of his late wife and
[1391.28] after her of their children We have
[1395.68] nothing in that, tell me what will we do now
[1399.10] [Sangeet]
[1401.12] By the way Khala you told me the other day
[1405.20] that this brave man is very bad minded and bad tempered
[1408.06] [Sangeet]
[1410.12] but
[1411.16] mom there is no flaw in him so he is made for me Get
[1419.84] me married to Momna

[1690.72] you are like Amma not only in looks but also in habits,
[1694.28] well I am fine, but now I ca

[1771.32] to Mrs. Farar, we have paid the dues,
[1774.44] our intention is to pay whatever dues are there legally to the
[1778.44] widow on time,
[1782.80] I think your mother has not told you
[1786.48] and my mother is not there,
[1792.48] if she had known about this respect of honor, then she would have come in
[1798.12] front of you with empty hands  I would have been sitting here
[1806.52] [Music]
[1812.79] [Music]
[1819.05] [Music]
[1826.24] Thank you
[1829.57] [Music]
[1839.22] [Music]
[1842.20] Baba, my heart wants me to die too,
[1845.56] but how can I leave Abir and Sami at the
[1848.96] mercy of this woman? I don't
[1850.76] know why she has come to our house.
[1855.04] You didn't care for me at all,
[1859.36] but I care for your children.
[1869.56] I never thought that our lives would suddenly become so difficult.
[1872.85] [Music]
[1881.48] Now set your face right, Fiza beta,
[1884.72] what happened
[1889.08] aunty? I think that now you should
[1891.40] take some action seriously. And the girl is
[1894.72] not even going out of Arham's life.
[1897.88] You know how I feel when I am with Arham. I
[1903.80] feel as if even though she is with me, she is
[1911.96] not with me. She is in that girl's thoughts.
[1916.16] And you know what new excuse she has found these days. She keeps
[1924.20] complaining all the time. Don't wear this, don't wear that. Don't
[1927.36] meet this person, don't meet that person. Her thinking has become like those people.
[1930.56] I am going mad.
[1933.84] Arham is not at fault in this. Fiza Afan wanted
[1937.08] Arham to get married to that girl.  I tried
[1939.24] explaining to him a lot but he never
[1942.28] listened to me. I always said that we should
[1945.40] not mix with such people who are
[1947.80] not of any benefit to us.
[1949.36] See, those who lived in the annex till yesterday will now
[1953.96] come and sit next to us,
[1958.24] aunty. You have removed those people from the NC,
[1963.48] how will you remove them from Arham's heart,
[1967.60] son? Don't worry. Arham is definitely stubborn
[1970.84] but he is not a boss himself. I just
[1973.16] know that he is confused. I am not worried about his confusion.
[1978.40] You just start preparing for the wedding. I do
[1981.44] n't want any further delay in your marriage.
[1985.68] Aunty, you are amazing. Tell me one
[1989.80] thing, will Arham marry anyone
[1993.48] on your saying? And I forgot, you were the one who had
[1997.72] promised us that my dear
[2000.08] son, I will not trouble you at all now.
[2002.24] I will
[2004.24] not come in between in any of your decisions. Yes, yes son, I
[2007.20] want to see him settled, so his
[2009.16] disturbance will end. I will talk to him today itself.
[2011.80] You just have to keep a check on
[2014.72] whom he is meeting and where he is going. It is now
[2017.92] your responsibility to handle him with love.
[2022.83] [Music]
[2026.04] Son, of
[2035.96] course,
[2045.64] your son fell asleep crying for you.
[2047.40] What a thing! If you are a little around, he
[2051.12] misses you. He is a
[2052.56] child, he has never
[2055.76] seen a mother. That is
[2062.48] why, whoever loves him like a mother, he becomes his.
[2065.04] Well, goddess of love.
[2067.92] Now, tell me what to do about the dues. The
[2070.56] electricity bill has come and the gas bill is also
[2072.76] pending for two months.
[2075.40] Mrs. Fahmida Abrar, she has collected the dues. What a
[2082.52] woman! I will
[2085.40] kill her. Stay seated. Come here. The more you
[2089.00] make noise, the more that woman will become attached to her.
[2093.52] We will have to handle her in many ways. This is too much,
[2097.68] Aapi. Even after so much,
[2099.88] you are saying that we have to handle her politely. Yes, one should
[2107.40] talk to him according to his status.
[2109.24] [Music]
[2112.64] Afaan uncle had also said the same thing. The
[2118.92] smaller and meaner the enemy is,
[2122.64] the lower we will have to stoop from our level.
[2127.72] If only
[2128.60] Baba had listened to us, Afaan uncle, then we would
[2132.88] not have to see this day with this woman,
[2134.84] Aapi Afaan uncle.  What is it and he did not come to meet
[2139.52] me, he did
[2145.28] not even come to Baba's funeral
[2148.76] [Music]
[2154.24] That day it was Aram's engagement,
[2160.60] Ram did not even
[2163.84] come, so
[2168.16] what happened to his love for you, that affection, he did not keep even that honor,
[2169.96] no one keeps anyone's honor
[2172.62] [Music]
