[510.55] [Prashant] I had
[516.44] never thought that at some point in life I would feel so helpless
[519.28] but this is all your fault
[522.64] I told you that our life the decision should also be
[525.40] ours but
[528.28] no you

[580.84] Baba  After his departure, I can't
[584.92] even think of leaving them
[587.84] [Music]
[593.68] Perhaps it is for these difficult circumstances that
[596.56] nature has taught me everything Mumina,
[600.40] what should I do
[602.65] [Music]
[606.12] Your stubbornness has broken me Do you have any
[611.84] idea how lonely I have been without you I have
[616.68] everything to live for, but the
[624.16] feeling of living, the feeling of living is all that is left with you I
[630.96] really miss you a lot, you take
[633.96] care of yourself, don't worry about me
[638.28] Fiza is a very nice girl,
[645.44] Saj will take great care of you
[648.11] [Music]

[654.92] Saj is bad or
[660.72] not, who knows the pain is
[665.16] infinite, every moment, in every moment How can
[670.28] I forget
[672.56] you, your reflection is there in my dreams
[678.44] How can I tell
[683.96] you You went away, I was forced, how can I express
[689.60] this pain All the dreams became thirsty,
[694.68] raining chhamchham
[697.30] [Music]
[708.09] [Music]
[717.96] Akhiya
[723.52] [Music]
[734.00] Mamma, where were you I worked so much
[736.96] and don't change my program, my
[740.56] mood gets off
[741.96] You had to spoil your mood and I am
[745.00] losing my mind here, I do
[747.52] n't understand the status given by the parents, if I take
[749.52] away Yash's life, then they will come to their senses, what are you
[754.64] saying, has a new
[757.52] story started, was this chapter of NC people
[759.88] not closed,
[762.64] this story is very old but a new twist has come in it, on
[767.12] one side aunty's need and on the
[770.16] other side Arham's
[773.28] need, but aunty you probably don't know one thing,
[779.40] that girl is giving you competition from the first day,
[783.20] that girl is giving you competition from the first day
[786.08] and you just don't accept defeat and she does
[789.76] n't get bored of winning, what nonsense are
[792.76] you talking, what win or win, that girl does
[796.52] n't have the guts to even take her name in this house,
[800.60] Arham will marry you only and
[805.44] his own wish will be included in it, you people are right, whatever you do,
[813.00] whatever decision you take, the
[814.96] final decision will be of Arham only,
[818.40] right? And do you know that whatever
[821.68] decisions Arham has taken till now, they were not his decisions
[825.04] but Momna's?  It was the reaction to the refusal of the girl
[828.88] and how do I know this,
[832.12] your beloved son himself has told me this,
[835.04] he has asked for time, he has
[839.76] asked me for time, I have fallen so low to come out of the intoxication of my old love, do I not have any
[848.84] other option to get married, do I not
[853.12] want the favour of your son's marriage,
[857.24] what's the matter, he should marry me, all the
[861.60] rituals should be with me, but there is someone else in his heart, I do not
[863.52] accept this, nothing like this will
[867.08] happen, Fiza, do not compare yourself with that girl,
[870.72] son, Mama, neither your insistence will be fulfilled, nor will he be able to be
[875.60] happy with Pizza, you should
[879.12] write this down, I also know her this much,
[882.92] these middle class girls also make their
[885.52] pride an issue of everything, sacrifice everything in emotions,
[891.04] but son Arham will marry you only, this is
[894.92] my promise to you and he will keep you very happy too,
[896.96] I
[900.24] can go to any extent for your happiness, whether you consider it my
[903.52] insistence or mother's
[908.22] [Prashan]
[910.16] [Music]
[917.52] Haq Falla Mara Diye, the heat has
[921.72] worsened, here come the ration brother  I
[926.64] gave money to Jeba, the
[929.32] poor girl is so nice, she was saying that every month I will
[932.60] deliver the ration to your
[935.64] house,
[937.20] why did you get the ration for our house delivered, Jeba aunty, have you gone
[940.72] mad, yes I have gone
[943.80] mad that I have got into this trouble,
[946.48] I don't have money, get
[951.80] all these people to talk to me and you keep trapping your prince like brother, I
[955.40] think you
[958.96] got something from your father and he died poor leaving behind no factories, we don't have a penny to
[964.32] spend, were
[969.04] you somewhere in Baba's office,
[972.16] still you are saying that you do
[975.00] n't have money, yes, the office people called me by phone, I did not
[978.08] reach
[980.04] there flying, you should get jealous,
[984.32] I am not jealous about this too and neither do I have
[987.72] time for all these things,
[990.48] see, there are some kitchen items, bring them
[994.48] and also bring something for Sami, I am just
[997.52] telling you that out of the money those people
[999.64] gave, only my medicines came, the
[1005.64] office people were telling that your
[1009.76] father has taken a big loan
[1012.96] All the money that comes from them is spent on debt,
[1015.84] we don't get anything
[1018.97] [Music]
[1024.16] Well, how can this happen?
[1026.88] Baba never said anything like this. Look,
[1031.76] how can this happen? I have a lot of things to say.
[1034.16] At this age, he shouldn't have had a child.
[1036.28] Then your mother died. Then you
[1039.48] married me and brought me to this house. And then you
[1041.60] yourself died. Tell me, none of this should have happened.
[1044.40] Where do we take this matter?
[1049.44] I was just asking
[1052.60] why Baba would take a loan? How do I know
[1054.56] why your father took a loan? You should have asked him when he was alive. You must have had
[1059.12] some need. And these people from the office are
[1062.08] not relatives of anyone who will
[1064.76] forgive our debt.
[1066.20] Even relatives don't forgive debts.
[1071.48] But what do you people
[1074.44] know about how relations are maintained with relatives? If we
[1077.20] spend some time, we will know that
[1080.00] our life is going on well even without relatives. That is
[1082.80] visible
[1087.16] [Music]
[1088.88] Well, that relative of yours had come to
[1092.64] congratulate. It was good. Very quickly,
[1095.24] he thought that he also had to congratulate.
[1098.72] Now if someone comes to pay tribute, we can't
[1102.80] stop him, right? Stopping him is a
[1105.24] far cry. We shouldn't open our doors for such relatives.
[1112.04] Look at these worthless people. Whenever they felt like it, they became relatives. Whenever they felt like it, they
[1114.84] broke the relationship and left. Is that a
[1116.68] problem?
[1117.26] [Music] They did
[1118.48] n't come to make any relationships. They only
[1122.48] came to pay tribute.
[1125.08] Well, this is a good thing. At
[1129.84] least I thought, you have forgotten them. By
[1132.88] the way, don't worry about your relationships. But
[1141.52] for your relationships [Music], please don't worry about me
[1146.81] [Music] The
[1154.08] last time I went to meet Abrar,
[1158.44] I had broken all relationships with him and come back.
[1166.40] Then neither did he come to meet me again after that,
[1170.72] nor did my Ana allow me to
[1178.72] go to him. It's very bad, very bad. I
[1182.00] wish I hadn't done this.
[1188.88] This feeling of not being with him at the last moment haunted me all my life.
[1191.29] [Music]
[1193.56] I too regret a lot.
[1197.24] Papa,
[1198.80] Fiza and Mama both knew about this
[1200.80] and both of them hid this thing from us.
[1202.50] [Music]
[1204.00] Mama, I can never go to this extent in hatred.  I
[1206.96] could not even think
[1208.64] and
[1210.88] then what happened to her, why is she doing this,
[1215.20] your mama did very bad by
[1219.84] hiding the news of Abrar's death from us,
[1224.00] but the regret is that
[1227.20] in her eyes a living or a dead person has no
[1229.76] importance,
[1232.16] she
[1236.44] can go to any extent to fulfill her purpose, but baba, this was
[1238.72] not love, this was sheer selfishness,
[1244.28] you have no idea how much I am hurt by mama's act,
[1249.72] I can understand your condition son,
[1254.00] but I also know Amal's nature very well,
[1260.40] she loves
[1262.80] you a lot, but she loves her caste more than you
[1266.40] [Sangeet],
[1267.64] she does not see anyone else in front of her caste,
[1275.44] Papa, I feel very suffocated, I
[1280.36] feel myself in some prison,
[1286.12] please let me go, I am
[1290.76] not with Momna in her most difficult time,
[1293.92] what could be a bigger relief for me than this
[1298.41] [Sangeet]
[1302.92] everything will be fine son, Inshallah
[1306.60] everything will be fine [
[1308.33] Sangeet] will
[1317.04] go
[1324.01] [Sangeet]
[1332.96] Assalam
[1335.00] Walekum Walekum Assalam, what is this Riya you have
[1338.00] created  Hey brother, what should I tell you, I am
[1341.12] in Iddat, so I used to
[1343.72] leave the house on the pretext of medicines, I have to maintain my modesty, I
[1346.64] wore this because
[1349.52] if my neighbor would have found out, she would have
[1351.44] caught me beforehand, I would not have given up, I feel like
[1353.20] talking about something important, we will keep
[1355.72] talking about important things, I
[1358.72] swear by Allah, I am feeling so hungry, I have to come here everyday, my
[1360.64] brain is tired of eating dal and rice, order me
[1363.08] something nice to eat, for now drink this juice, it is
[1370.12] very
[1372.04] hot, by the way, what important work had come up
[1374.80] that you called me here, you could have
[1376.92] called me to your house, you could have sat there and talked to them peacefully
[1378.76] and with this excuse I could have seen your house also,
[1381.48] now we are related,
[1384.40] what do you think, I called you here to
[1387.12] establish a relationship, so what other
[1389.12] motive could there be, how did you
[1391.80] get my number, well, this was what I was thinking,
[1394.48] brother, do you not want to come to my house, that is why
[1396.28] you are calling me to you,
[1398.88] how did I get your number, how were you called here,
[1401.08] this is not for you to understand, the thing for
[1403.36] you to understand is
[1406.04] why I called you here, that is what I
[1408.76] tell you now  what is the matter
[1412.68] I want you to take your Momna
[1416.52] away from my son's life so much that
[1419.44] my son never sees her face the meaning is
[1423.56] very simple
[1428.24] Mamna you make such an arrangement that she is
[1431.68] worthy of Aram
[1433.56] [Music]
[1434.88] no because of her Aram disobeys me a lot
[1438.24] which I cannot tolerate at all
[1441.28] oh
[1443.32] Allah what is there to be surprised about in this
[1446.44] we hate some people so much that we feel like
[1449.60] killing them
[1455.88] [Music]
[1463.84] but if you kill them then
[1467.84] where will we bury them this is your job
[1471.12] yes I will do it ok ok
[1475.60] then I will tell you on phone
[1480.32] [Music]
[1498.36] Arham I wanted to talk to you about something important
[1501.68] can we go out I am not in the mood to go out will
[1503.64] you go ah how can I go alone I have to go
[1507.28] with you please leave
[1508.92] me alone I am not going out I was having a
[1512.12] headache I have
[1513.64] come home to rest
[1516.40] we will talk later
[1519.68] Arham why are you getting angry at me by doing
[1523.36] all this do you want to prove
[1525.08] that it was all my fault that those times ca
[1527.08] n't come back  I can't come so leave
[1531.52] it
[1534.25] [Sangeet]
[1536.04] A look I am a very straight forward girl
[1539.88] I can't talk in a roundabout way
[1543.80] I just did what aunty told me to
[1547.32] do
[1548.78] [Sangeet]
[1550.12] And anyway I think aunty is right
[1554.72] those people are not capable of having
[1557.72] any relationship with them who is capable and
[1559.76] who is not capable how can you decide this
[1562.36] without meeting me
[1564.76] this is not my decision this is aunty's
[1567.84] belief
[1569.32] listen fiza we both have to spend our lives together the
[1573.00] important thing is how much our thinking matches
[1579.20] Momina Momina is first of all my friend
[1582.68] [Sangeet] so is
[1586.60] she still your friend
[1590.80] she will always be my friend no matter how much
[1593.24] we fight or get
[1596.32] angry
[1598.40] but this Jag Mamna is in my heart no
[1604.72] one can take that
[1607.12] [Sangeet]
[1614.27] [Sangeet]
[1616.60] can
[1619.09] [Sangeet]
[1628.50] [Prashansa] what is this
[1641.36] rudeness what are you doing here just like this I feel
[1651.68] embarrassed why does your nephew come here everyday
[1654.08] in baba's life
[1655.96] he was not allowed to come here then
[1657.88] why does he come now hi  Allah, what has
[1659.48] my beloved son done now, Kasi Kasi, where will
[1663.60] he stay? O Aunty, I had gone to get water for you.
[1666.72] Just listen to me. If you are
[1669.72] so fond of meeting him, then
[1672.44] go and meet him at his home, but he will not
[1674.60] come here. It is better that you explain to him in your own language,
[1677.56] O Wife, first you listen, I have brought
[1681.16] him up like a son. Wherever I
[1683.92] live, he will stay there. My house is his
[1686.76] house. I called him myself. He had to go to the market, didn't
[1689.40] I? And then he had to
[1691.40] sell the ring also. It does not matter to me whether you sell the ring or the earring.
[1695.28] But this person will
[1698.68] not come to my house. Yes brother,
[1702.48] this is your house. It seems I will
[1705.40] live as a tenant in this house. I was just
[1708.36] helping you. What are you saying that
[1711.72] you have got so angry. Don't talk nonsense. I do
[1714.92] n't understand the need to talk to me.
[1719.30] [Music]
[1723.28] You, Tauba,
[1725.76] Tauba, see the symptoms.
[1728.39] [Praise]
[1732.04] His Aunt, now I want to marry this girl. My
[1736.40] tongue is like a hot chilli and her
[1739.64] face is like a red
[1741.76] tomato. Oh, if such a girl comes in your life, Aunty, then
[1745.64] with her.  The fun of living life is
[1748.28] ours. Just get me and her married as soon as possible and then
[1752.44] enjoy later. Come here and
[1760.40] see, there is no need to do anything wrong.
[1763.28] This hot chilli that is burning right now will make your
[1766.16] mind go crazy. You don't know that you
[1770.00] cannot do this either. So aunt, tell me
[1774.00] how to get your point across. I
[1776.80] know very well how to get your point across.
[1779.64] I have told you not to do anything wrong.
[1783.68] When ghee can be extracted with a straight finger, then
[1787.12] what is the need for you to bend the finger.
[1789.40] Live with respect, stay in the neighbourhood. How
[1793.52] long will we keep moving from one house to another like animals?
[1795.72] We have a bungalow like a palace. Be
[1798.40] a little patient. If you are saying so,
[1802.08] I will accept it aunt. But my marriage and her
[1805.08] marriage should be done soon.
[1808.00] Just take it,
[1810.32] drink the water, son. Have you
[1814.72] brought water? Have you mixed poison in it?
[1818.72] You are not going to die so soon. You have to
[1821.00] die only after getting me and her married.
[1824.40] I will play a game for you. Today, I will play a game for
[1827.44] aunt with my own hands.
[1830.08] I will take this, this is a game to play. No, don't
[1834.48] play, my mind is dizzy. Did
[1836.56] n't you see?  She has behaved so badly, play the game, don't
[1840.48] worry about her, let her tell you once,
[1846.36] I know very well how to handle her, if I
[1851.72] get some free time, I will take her
[1855.04] out of the house, bring this work of mine
[1858.20] and do my work very well, I know
[1864.20] I should become yours,
[1866.68] you have brought me up by bringing me up, I have
[1870.32] n't learnt anything, but I will learn something, I thought, you have
[1877.00] troubled me a lot, mama [
[1889.86] sangeet]
[1901.80] so that's it, then why are you fooling me or yourself, love her
[1906.52] and make
[1910.32] her, she doesn't even accept it, she doesn't need love, she should accept it
[1918.30] [sangeet] she needs belonging,
[1921.04] maybe mama has something to give her,
[1926.24] listen to me, if she really
[1929.96] loved you, then she wouldn't have thought about all these things
[1933.72] and would have been happy with you,
[1937.92] everyone else becomes normal,
[1941.32] earlier I was angry with her,
[1944.08] but now I feel that maybe she was absolutely right in her place, where there is
[1948.36] no respect,
[1951.32] life becomes like a prison, please
[1955.04] all these things are useless, boring
[1957.96] philosophy is not that boring,
[1960.96] if  If you understand
[1964.44] [Sangeet] So are
[1970.56] you regretting it now
[1976.04] If I had a way to go back, then
[1978.88] probably I would have definitely
[1981.48] regretted [Sangeet] And she does not believe in these half-hearted relationships
[1988.16] And she wanted to come to this house with everyone's happiness
[1994.12] Maybe I cannot give her this happiness
[2000.16] That is why she found peace in going away
[2002.70] [Sangeet]
[2007.96] And I will
[2009.36] come to this house
[2013.60] But in your heart
[2015.70] [Sangeet] It
[2021.00] takes some time for the weather to change
[2032.80] [Sangeet]
[2035.96] Come on,
[2044.32] Aapi and I brothers are not happy with our engagement [
[2048.18] Sangeet]
[2052.60] Faraz has also noticed this
[2056.64] What difference does it make There are many people
[2060.68] who are not happy
[2062.84] Yet they spend their lives with each other There is
[2068.60] still time Well,
[2071.36] tell me Faraz
[2074.72] When is Mumma coming to Pakistan I am
[2076.56] not in a hurry to get married I have to
[2080.04] focus on my studies right now Oh
[2084.92] why I just want you to
[2087.56] settle down quickly You will settle down and go to your home I do
[2093.36] n't want you to do everything
[2097.44] that I did
[2098.39] [Sangeet]
[2102.80] Walk on the path that I walked and held her hand
[2105.70] [Sangeet]  Just
[2109.04] gone
[2116.60] Abhir
[2120.04] [Music]
[2125.80] Abhir
[2130.02] [Music]
[2135.88] Even today she falls asleep while talking
[2139.44] and there is me, the
[2142.40] whole night is spent with my eyes wide open due to fear, Oh
[2150.84] God, please give her such a peaceful sleep always,
[2155.32] mother
[2158.24] also turn off the light, friend, I am feeling good sleep,
[2162.64] yes, I will do all the work, you
[2173.24] sleep comfortably, see aunt, I will tell you one thing,
[2176.80] don't make any plan to get you killed
[2181.68] and your madam, please be
[2184.84] on the side, she will get trapped.
