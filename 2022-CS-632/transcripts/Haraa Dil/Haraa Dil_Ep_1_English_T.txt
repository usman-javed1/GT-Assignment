[317.76] love, sincerity and anayat, until he
[323.24] brings a formal relationship for Momna, I can't sit and depend on anyone like this,
[328.04] firstly
[330.40] I don't understand you women, don't
[334.08] build castles in the air, but you have to collect mustard seeds in your palm,
[337.68] hey, what's the hurry, why's the hurry to get Momna
[340.44] married,
[341.68] hey, when I was of Momna's
[345.32] age, I was a mother of a girl,
[348.68] if you didn't like going to college, then
[352.88] what is Momna Bijari's fault in this,

[411.68] and honour will increase.

[528.36] You made me wait for half an hour.
[531.20] You know how difficult it is for me to wait.  I
[533.92] feel that
[535.84] if coming here and waiting is so
[538.68] difficult then don't come. You are comfortable.
[543.68] Don't complicate your life because of me.

[598.12] Come on
[600.84] [Music]
[610.08] How many days have you not got your car serviced?
[612.40] How many times will I say the same thing?
[615.52] Why don't you understand? If you don't want to
[618.00] work, then go from here. Salam Begum
[623.40] Sahiba. You should have been with Arham at this time,
[625.92] right Begum Sahiba. He had refused to come
[627.96] with me. I am obedient to his orders.
[629.96] What could I do? Stop talking nonsense.
[632.24] You are obedient to my orders. I understood.
[635.36] If you have to work, then do it this way.
[637.88] Otherwise, you should also get out of here. Begum
[639.84] Sahiba. I understand my job as well as
[641.60] my responsibility. You should make Arham
[643.72] understand. He doesn't want to take you along. So
[645.52] what would I do? Get out of here.
[648.04] Get out of here right now.  Don't show your face to me again,
[655.92] mummy, there is no such pair in these
[658.52] that I can wear to a wedding,
[661.36] and look at these long frocks, the
[664.68] fashion of these is also out of date, so tell me one thing, does
[667.92] your fashion change every month,
[670.40] you had just bought these clothes, it has not been
[673.00] a month since they were bought for Faza's wedding,
[675.16] and you had bought them as per your choice,
[678.04] now what is so bad in these, I should also
[680.08] know, oh mummy, I had bought them from the sale, that
[683.88] too for Rs. 10000, if I wear this shabby piece of yours in the neighborhood, I will get a
[686.48] lot of praise, but
[689.24] in Areej's wedding, no way, I have no interest in getting myself insulted,
[692.88] and have
[695.72] you seen Atul aunty, she roams around wearing a suit worth Rs. 10,000 even in her house, if she
[701.00] can afford it, then she should wear it, hey, when the
[703.80] difference between their and our status is huge, then
[706.56] what is the need for you to compete,
[708.80] yes, there is a
[713.00] difference like heaven and earth, by the way, mummy,
[716.52] I don't understand what is common in the friendship of Afan uncle and Baba,
[718.00] and also, childhood friendship like this does
[721.24] n't happen even in films, there too  The style has changed,
[723.04] just do it.
[725.36] You don't need to talk much. No matter how expensive the clothes you
[727.60] wear, we can't reach their status.
[730.88] And anyway, we should only dream as much
[733.68] as we can hold in our eyes. So, the
[735.88] dreams we see are their
[738.36] problem and it is also important for them to go. It is
[740.76] not necessary for me to go.
[754.04] You talk so much, pick it up and go
[756.64] from here before Mama comes. And listen,
[760.56] take this too.
[768.12] Servants should be kept in their place,
[771.00] son. Otherwise, they get on top of their heads. It seems that
[773.68] someone is in trouble again today. By the way, Mama
[777.88] only works at your behest and I do
[781.48] n't treat you for anything. He listens to what you say with one ear
[784.32] and blows it out of the other. Isn't it?
[788.00] How naive you are, son. Get
[793.56] used to seeing life with a wise eye.
[797.20] I don't want you to say such
[800.72] things in front of your husband after marriage. Whoever has his own status, let
[804.96] him stay within his status. I understood,
[811.80] please Mama, this principle of yours doesn't apply to me.
[817.12] At least the husband can carry on our status.
[821.92] yes you should have some problem easily he roams around
[825.76] day and night and the streets in which
[827.76] his car also goes with great difficulty
[832.09] [sangeet] he
[837.76] is
[840.96] Momina
[846.00] Momina listen what is your problem
[850.64] why do you often behave so strange has
[854.24] something happened at home has uncle or aunty
[856.72] said something you have
[858.84] not come home for tea for many days
[862.96] maybe he forgot the way to our house or
[866.08] something else that's it
[869.68] and whatever
[873.00] happens after that thankfully we do
[875.72] n't know anything about it otherwise we would go
[878.20] mad just thinking about it I do
[882.72] n't even want to know anything about my future my future is in
[885.88] front of me
[888.18] [sangeet]
[890.20] very
[892.28] beautiful very
[896.56] wonderful sometimes the thing which is in front of us we have it
[902.16] but it is not ours ah please don't pace
[907.52] mystic the thing which belongs to the one gets it come let
[915.36] me drop you

[944.44] specially invited her in Raj's mehndi
[946.40] and we you should meet her I want to you she is a
[951.00] student of international media  She can
[953.32] manage her lifestyle
[961.60] Anush are you serious
[964.68] Mama you have liked that girl for me there is nothing
[967.64] girlish about it
[970.36] why Papa I am right
[974.25] [Sangeet]
[976.56] no looking for a girl is a very boring job I
[980.48] like Anush very much in fact my
[983.08] Bhabhi should be like her
[985.20] stunning stylish outspoken
[988.52] you lock her down she will be perfect
[991.08] for you why did you both get into the trap of getting me married
[996.40] I was not in favour of Aariz getting married so soon in fact there is
[1002.36] a time for everything Ram and I
[1006.12] want you to get serious about your marriage
[1010.32] you complete your semester
[1013.52] till then we will complete the preparations for your marriage
[1015.60] Umma please please you will not
[1018.68] talk to Anush or me Subhan for my marriage
[1024.08] she will be your type not my type
[1027.08] [Sangeet]
[1033.64] I will marry only that girl whom I
[1036.92] like
[1041.52] okay the choice should definitely be yours
[1046.40] but I
[1050.92] will be my friend you have not met her yet
[1053.72] I am sure when you meet her you will
[1056.36] change your mind
[1063.27] [Sangeet] you will give salad
[1073.04] Look Papa, you know my opinion cannot be changed, it is not like
[1075.76] coffee in my life that I keep
[1079.04] changing the taste and checking it,
[1082.28] you know very well that Atul is
[1086.84] not in the habit of compromising,
[1091.52] he will use his status, high family and
[1096.36] his friendship card with Subhan family to
[1098.64] harm himself
[1100.12] and you too, this is his problem
[1102.48] Papa, I wanted to study medicine, but they
[1104.96] put me in business, it's fine
[1106.96] but I will not compromise on my emotions,
[1110.24] your mother has not accepted my friendship with Abrar till date
[1118.68] and if she had come to know earlier
[1121.64] that your friendship with Momina will
[1123.64] reach this extent, she would have posted guards around you,
[1126.44] now I myself
[1129.44] pay the salary to the guards for not doing the duty,
[1131.36] however, I have a request to you
[1135.60] son, whatever commitment you make to Momina, you
[1139.04] must fulfil it,
[1144.16] I don't want to be embarrassed in front of Abrar
[1149.27] [Sangeet]
[1154.84] Son Papa, do you know
[1162.28] what is the best part of my friendship with Momina
[1162.99] [Sangeet] there is no
[1164.96] commitment, no obstacle between us
[1168.78] [Music]
[1170.88] Still I feel that whenever I
[1172.48] meet her I am the
[1174.24] happiest.
[1179.68] Papa you yourself say that for a successful
[1182.60] married life it is
[1185.04] very important for the husband and wife to be friends. So
[1186.96] I just want to see my best friend
[1191.24] in my home and in my life.
[1196.00] Please tell uncle
[1199.72] not to make my life difficult. I really love her.
[1203.76] You are absolutely right
[1208.52] son. The
[1211.60] relationships that give happiness are the ones that are closest to the heart.
[1217.64] I do not promise that I will change your mother
[1220.40] 's thinking. It is not an
[1222.36] easy task to do so.
[1226.56] But
[1229.44] I assure you that I will support you as far as possible.
[1236.20] Thank you.
[1241.45] [Music]
[1257.12] You.
[1267.69] [Music]

[1305.96] number. Listen you are that mistake of my life
[1308.68] which I switch on with great happiness.
[1313.68] By the way, at this time of the night, that too is such a thing. Oh
[1319.08] Allah.
[1320.32] Well, tell me one thing. Those who talk such
[1323.88] big things, who
[1325.44] just talk like lions, there should be a cure for them.
[1329.76] Think about it. There is a cure but it is
[1333.00] not possible without your evolution.
[1335.24] Life time consultancy.  This is an offer with the
[1339.36] passes and
[1341.60] benefits Here, there is no news of a moment
[1344.52] and people are talking about a lifetime
[1346.76] Listen, when happiness knocks at the door, one must
[1350.88] welcome it happily, one must
[1354.24] not do this drama
[1357.20] ok listen, I will come for breakfast
[1359.68] today, let's do it together

[1409.28] think they should get engaged You know,
[1412.52] this chapter of life is very
[1416.76] interesting, yes, if Arham
[1419.32] agrees for engagement, then he does
[1422.12] n't want to take the burden of marriage right now What do you
[1424.36] mean, you said that he is
[1427.16] not dependent on you for anything, he does not
[1429.64] deny anything, it means that
[1433.56] I should not care about his choice and wish
[1441.31] [Music]
[1446.44] Assalam

[1461.44] This is our small gift,
[1464.36] what was the need to be so formal for it?

[1867.56] nonsense are you talking about? You have no right to
[1869.76] talk to me like this.

[1946.08] Hafiz.
[1947.94] [Sangeet] It
[1956.56] was Afaan's call, the poor guy is very upset because of Momna.  These
[1960.60] golden dreams of yours and Afan Bhai that I should get
[1969.28] Amtula married by finding a good match,
[1971.84] everything is clear, everything is
[1975.40] known, but you refuse every good proposal,
[1979.84] how can I refuse Afan, his
[1985.12] happiness is also important
[1989.08] for me, when I consult him, he outright refuses, we should
[1995.96] make our daughter's life a torture in the love of Afan Bhai, this is not
[1998.64] a fool's errand,
[2001.60] look Amal Bhabhi is not bad at heart, yes her
[2006.48] tongue is definitely bitter, who has seen that heart,
[2010.36] tongue is seen, tauba tauba and that too such that it is
[2018.16] filled with poison, ya
[2020.44] Allah ya Allah

[2032.44] happened, oh brother if you take so much tension, then your head will
[2035.56] spin, sit, sit, sit,
[2042.48] whatever Amat Bhabhi has said today
[2045.96] in the wedding, after that I am worried about Momna,
[2048.80] Chana A also you take rest, did you
[2052.60] even eat food or are you
[2054.52] just getting angry after listening to Atul Bhabhi,

[2201.07] [Music]
[2230.68] Mr. Abrar maybe this is good news for you
[2233.56] but I don't encourage pregnancy at this age the
[2239.12] mother can also have problems the child
[2242.04] can also have problems
[2245.60] my advice is that you go to a good
[2248.32] gynecological college and get advice on
[2254.00] pregnancy no no please
[2255.52] see this report is
[2259.24] definitely wrong
[2260.92] doctor

[2275.60] is pregnant [Music]
