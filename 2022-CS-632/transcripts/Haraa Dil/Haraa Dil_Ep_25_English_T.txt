[559.16] n't talk to people who come from the back door, do you understand, get out
[562.68] of here, I will call my guards,
[565.48] no no
[568.12] no, before making any mistake of this kind,
[572.48] think once, what will you
[575.60] tell the person who comes, Adal
[578.92] ji, if you had come from the right way, it would have been difficult for you,
[584.52] anyway, the
[587.60] police are
[590.00] after me and I don't have any place to live
[593.72] and there can be no better and safer place for me than this house,
[600.32] do you
[603.80] know, I am not worthy of this love, don't
[606.48] love me so much
[614.80] [Music]
[617.44] You, hello, hello, yes, Momina has come, she is at her home,
[622.68] if you want to talk to her,
[624.72] Faraz has told me everything, but I wanted to talk to
[626.92] you, there is a bad news,
[630.32] look, I will need your help
[633.40] and your help is also possible, this is my doubt,
[636.52] what kind of fear, you talk openly  What
[639.20] 's the matter, my men have got Kas's mobile phone. The
[641.60] last number in his mobile list is
[644.52] of some Amtula user,
[647.32] which he has received. I have come to know from Faraz
[651.36] that your mother's name is also
[653.28] Atul. Hello, hello,
[658.04] am. Hey friend, you should have listened to me completely
[662.41] [Music]
[667.80] Yes, but whenever I
[671.84] think about Momna, I get the feeling of Amtula.
[699.40] Hey
[712.37] [Music]
[717.96] Hum
[720.37] [Music]
[723.32] Ay

[738.72] After all, our mission is also the same
[749.41] [Music] Let's
[754.96] sit and sit, it should be your own
[760.68] [Prashant]
[763.68] But what was I saying, you and I should
[767.76] deal among ourselves.
[769.60] This will benefit you as well as me.
[773.56] What do they say?
[776.84] Yes, there will be no bass, no bass will play.
[781.48] And when there will be no one to pursue the case, then
[785.60] in two-four days, the case
[788.92] file will be
[791.96] closed. How can I trust you?
[798.40] Trusting me is now your compulsion.
[801.72] Apart from this, you have no other option
[806.08] because that girl will go to the police station and will take
[808.88] my name and I will take yours.
[812.96] What nonsense are you talking about,
[815.92] how can you take my name, say anything Atal ji, we
[820.40] both have become each other's compulsion
[822.77] [Music]
[825.96] I have already given you all the money I had to give you,
[828.72] I cannot help you more than this
[830.84] and now you should leave from here immediately
[832.80] and in any case,
[836.40] you did not do the work I had given you I had
[842.28] told you to take Momna away from Aram's life but your cowardice imposed
[846.96] Momna on my son's head for the entire life
[855.01] [Music]
[862.72] This is the worst thing of my life,
[869.92] all those
[872.28] expenses which I thought were my false impressions,
[877.20] today you have proved them all to be true
[882.42] [Music]
[884.52] I will not
[887.48] leave her and we are nothing like that, you are misunderstanding
[892.84] Honia, what should I do with you so
[895.96] that my heart finds peace today,
[902.20] what form of Shama is it that
[905.68] you can go to this extent in enmity with Momna, it's nothing like
[910.16] that oh the truth is in front of me
[913.85] [Music]

[994.40] very unlucky, he was very
[1001.08] unlucky, I will not say that you should have patience

[1020.88] years, or the one whose death is written by someone else's hands, it
[1023.80] never goes away
[1026.56] [Music], the
[1028.64] emptiness remains, just pray,
[1039.80] give him patience, he was very restless here,
[1044.88] perhaps he will find some
[1049.16] happiness,
[1053.04] if possible I would have
[1056.64] forgiven him

[1522.88] Momina, she did not want to keep me away from herself
[1525.24] and I kept moving away from her in your love
[1530.44] Because of my stubbornness and my stubbornness, today

[1597.00] Momina, you were
[1602.68] not talking to me for a long
[1606.04] time, you were facing problems, that's why you
[1609.04] came here to talk to him, yes, you did a good thing,
[1612.12] but where are you going, you won't sit?
[1619.80] What's the matter, you seem upset to me,

[1685.64] feeling of something being lost in your eyes
[1689.56] And I know
[1693.72] this
[1696.72] feeling neither lets you live nor die
[1701.28] If you get any chance to go back
[1703.92] [Music]
[1705.16] or to revive the relationship, do
[1708.24] n't let Ana come in between
[1713.88] This Ana deprives a person
[1718.33] [Music] of

[1724.40] and love
[1729.40] and
[1731.40] then only regret is left

[1813.28] I can't believe
[1815.04] how this could happen to aunty
[1817.52] Even Mama must not be able to believe it till now
[1820.28] What happened
[1823.60] to her, you guys did that to some policeman  Have you talked to him
[1826.20] or have you got a
[1828.24] lawyer, if
[1829.88] you say so I will talk to him, I
[1834.24] know a lawyer, he is very expert
[1836.40] in his work, maybe he can change the direction of this case, I have no
[1840.52] idea who I am
[1844.12] talking to, but dad and Aram are
[1847.52] contacting different people, right now the
[1850.08] only thing is that Mama's jail should fail soon, I do
[1853.40] n't know what condition she would be in there, I do
[1856.24] n't know how she would be living there, don't
[1859.04] worry, you are not worried, whatever
[1863.12] aunty has done, she has done it for her self-defense
[1865.72] and this was the punishment for that criminal,
[1868.40] if aunty had not done this then someone else would have killed him,
[1872.24] but I am not able to understand one thing that
[1875.56] till now why has Afan uncle not got aunty's interim bill done,
[1879.12] Mama has not said anything to anyone
[1881.52] [sangeet]
[1884.44] but still A uncle and Arham should have done something,
[1889.92] Mama did everything herself,
[1895.04] went to the police station and confessed, anyway
[1901.24] I am going to meet aunty, will
[1906.44] you come with me, on what right should I
[1911.40] come with you, the divorce papers are kept in my room,
[1915.24] you have done them  Did you sign the papers? Have
[1919.16] you accepted the divorce?
[1925.24] No, you
[1927.04] still have all the rights.
[1931.02] [Music]
[1932.56] I ask you once again, will you come with me?
[1938.08] Okay,
[1942.00] why have you come here? I am waiting to meet you.
[1946.28] I have come only to fulfill my duty. Aunty,
[1948.40] this is not your duty, nor do
[1951.56] I need it. Do you
[1954.28] understand? And there is no need to come here again?
[1957.20] Aunty, for you, every relationship is necessary,
[1959.48] but I remember my duty and debt.
[1963.20] You took the trouble that came upon Arham upon yourself.
[1967.52] You have given him a new life, and
[1970.80] he has given me to me.
[1973.84] You are the foundation of every relationship with Arham. Whether Arham is with you
[1980.08] or not,
[1982.16] he will always be yours.
[1987.68] That's why my heart will always be for both of you. [Music]

[2116.12] I told him to have lunch
[2119.80] with us,
[2120.84] but he refused.
[2124.36] You know that he is
[2126.48] alone at home. Who would be taking care of his food and drink?
[2132.52] I am worried.  He must be
[2135.76] busy somewhere, Bir Aapi, if he
[2140.08] was busy, he would have told me, then why are you asking me?
[2142.92] Ask him yourself,
[2144.88] tell me what has happened to me. He would
[2148.52] never get angry with you like this. He has not
[2150.48] one but a
[2151.80] thousand reasons to get angry with me. What has happened Aapi, he has
[2155.20] told you something. He says
[2158.28] that whatever has happened, the
[2161.48] reason for it is only
[2163.73] [Music]
[2168.80] me, only [
[2170.42] Music]
[2179.32] [Music]
[2188.24] what happened in the second baa
[2190.64] [Music]
[2195.72] listen, don't worry aunty, it will be alright
[2203.36] soon, but you should talk to Kas's family,
[2207.76] if they take back the case or the court
[2211.92] makes a deal with us, then the case will be over,
[2214.36] how can this happen in the law, what should I talk to
[2219.40] them, there is definitely a price for everything, don't
[2222.68] give Kas's family the life of his life and
[2225.36] end the matter, so is it so easy? It is
[2229.16] not so easy but it is not so difficult either, I don't
[2234.28] know
[2237.52] friend, till yesterday, nothing seemed difficult to me,
[2240.88] but things have become so complicated that I am
[2242.92] unable to understand what to do, don't
[2245.16] isolate yourself so much, we all are with you
[2248.72] and you  I guarantee that Momna will also
[2251.60] support you, if you talk to her once,
[2255.44] you will definitely get this problem out of hand.
