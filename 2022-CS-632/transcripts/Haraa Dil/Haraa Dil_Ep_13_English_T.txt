[266.68] you are no one to speak between me and baba I
[268.64] understand

[276.00] I am ashamed that you
[280.08] are the father of such a stubborn and ill mannered daughter what relation is
[283.16] left between you and me
[285.92] I used to think that Shagufta brought her up with
[289.16] a lot of love and care
[291.24] after her departure she is upset and
[295.60] in shock that is why she comes to me with anger about everything
[298.16] how did I know that the
[300.84] matter here is something else hey I have not done this marriage for
[304.00] my happiness or for my peace
[306.16] I have done this marriage only because I am not free
[309.20] from the responsibility of Sami  You all are free
[312.13] [Music]
[313.28] Go what's the problem
[316.24] Abhi, why are you getting into an argument
[319.48] Baba, don't take your Abi's words seriously,
[323.04] you know if she had her way, she would
[326.72] even get into an argument with the wind There is no need to give an explanation Api
[331.24] and I don't fight with everyone
[333.64] and he does
[336.00] n't have even two paise respect for me in front of this woman Is there any
[338.28] way
[341.36] this
[342.41] [Praise]
[346.32] Baba Bibi, control your tongue
[350.88] and don't forget that I know how to give a
[354.32] better reply than you Abi Abi listen,
[358.76] look here,
[361.64] you know that Baba gets angry at first,
[364.76] refuses but later gives permission, right? I
[366.36] don't have even a little patience in me Api, I have to go
[372.08] and I will go and stay and for
[375.36] this I need money, tell Baba
[377.20] and if he doesn't give the money, then
[380.20] I will borrow it from a friend right
[384.80] now oh oh what did your mother eat to give
[388.76] birth to her, she does
[391.56] n't look like your sister Such a
[393.92] long tongue
[395.87] [Music]
[403.86] [Music]
[405.68] Then both your sisters are very smart,
[414.64] I will straighten you out  Mamma one chapter does not close and
[417.00] you open another one and sit down. Now from where did this
[419.76] come in my life? I have told you that
[422.40] I do not want to get married. I
[425.00] feel that getting me married has become the
[426.92] most important mission of your life. Ca
[432.36] n't we both talk about any other topic?
[433.28] Well, thank God you have accepted that
[436.96] one chapter of yours has closed. That too
[440.40] you have done on your own, with your own will, with your own
[442.84] happiness. Now what is your regret? I do
[445.36] not regret anything. I do
[447.80] not want to discuss all these things again. That's it.
[450.33] [Sangeet]
[452.40] Please
[454.84] find a good match for Fiza from your circle and get her married.
[456.32] If she has
[458.48] given you the authority to get her married.
[459.92] [Sangeet]
[461.24] Otherwise she is an independent girl. She
[464.24] can take her own decision very well. You do
[466.28] not need to show so much concern.
[469.68] But she is concerned about you.
[473.84] How can I ignore this fact? I can
[476.36] see that she likes you, she is
[479.84] happy with you and you are also
[482.16] comfortable with her. Then what is the issue,
[484.28] Mamma? You are so concerned about my marriage.  I have never
[485.88] understood the practical approach in the past
[487.88] and probably never will in the future
[490.48] If I am comfortable with her, it does
[492.88] n't at all mean that I will be happy even after marriage,
[494.68] friend Practical approach is what
[497.32] makes life, otherwise you wouldn't be standing at this crossroads
[500.16] today
[501.28] See, being a girl, how
[505.48] easily she parted ways with you
[508.24] You know what, my words will sound bitter to you,
[513.08] but because it is a compulsion, listen to me
[516.48] My paths and Momina's have definitely parted,
[519.16] but my feelings for her will take
[523.00] time to go away
[526.76] I don't want to put the burden of any relationship on myself,
[530.56] and I don't need it either
[536.72] Aram Fard Sekram What is there
[540.32] in that worthless girl that does
[542.56] n't go away from your heart and mind
[545.04] Because of her, you are repeatedly refusing me,
[548.12] going against my decision For God's sake,
[551.28] stop this drama Her
[554.24] interest in you has completely ended, but
[556.72] your madness remains the same
[559.88] Please move on Aram Her interest has not ended,
[562.96] Mama, her interest has changed  I do
[566.44] n't want to live without Sami, so
[569.52] I have told her that I will
[571.04] not accept her with Sami,
[574.04] so it's okay, raise your brother as a mother, one has to
[579.08] suffer for the deeds of one's parents, but for
[582.12] God's sake, you should
[585.44] come out of this story, see Fiza will
[589.28] prove to be the best life partner for you, trust
[592.52] me, I will wait for your answer
[596.28] and does Fiza also
[602.00] know what you are planning for her,
[603.60] of course,
[606.60] I have proposed to you only after talking to her
[609.36] and the truth is that I also always had
[613.24] this desire
[614.72] and I feel that Fiza has come
[617.52] back only for you, otherwise there was no dearth of relationships for her there,
[624.28] this is the issue,
[626.84] you
[629.72] see everyone's relationships in the world, you realize everyone, but
[631.88] when it comes to me,
[636.16] you don't realize, there are
[638.88] brokers
[643.55] [sangeet]
[651.22] [sangeet],
[667.08] aunty, why are you getting so upset
[669.84] and why are you forcing Arham so much to
[672.92] marry me,
[674.72] I know how to handle him
[678.08] and everything will be fine,
[680.72] all this is not so easy, she is a
[684.16] very clever girl and Arham's helplessness  She is taking
[688.08] advantage of him.
[690.72] Then some day she will come with her compulsions
[693.16] and then my son will be kind to her.
[696.64] I am waiting for that time
[699.16] when Arham gets suspicious of her.
[704.28] You must have that girl's number. I am the one who is
[707.96] trapped in my ex. You
[713.20] must be talking to her. You
[717.32] need the number as well as the permission to talk to her.
[721.48] But
[723.60] why are you thinking?
[725.76] [Sangeet] Do
[727.00] n't worry at all.
[731.40] I have heard that these middle class
[734.20] girls are
[738.76] very sensitive when it comes to their self-respect.
[740.95] [Sangeet]
[742.52] I will handle him.
[745.45] [Prashant]
[746.76] Now I have no tension.
[750.16] I know that you can handle Arham well.
[755.26] [Sangeet] I have
[765.84] known him since childhood. He is
[769.84] not as stubborn as you people have made
[774.16] him.
[781.91] [Sangeet]
[787.56] And he is so naughty that when you talk to him, he will
[790.20] cry and if I make him quiet, he will
[791.96] not keep quiet. Then he will keep on speaking. Yes,
[794.60] of course,
[801.76] I may have come early. No, Haram, you have
[805.60] come at the right time. Come, sit down. You
[808.44] guys do it. I will meet you later. We will
[811.64] definitely meet later.  But now it is
[813.84] important for both of you to meet and talk, all the
[817.16] relationships, all the
[818.44] reasons have ended
[821.56] and I did not do this because
[824.44] what should I talk to
[825.56] him, what was the need for you to do all this drama,
[829.00] I would have gone myself Momna yaar please [ __ ] off,
[833.56] both of you leave your childishness now, sit down,
[837.32] you guys talk, let's talk for the last time yaar
[840.28] please sit down for my sake,
[849.16] I have some important work so I am leaving
[853.76] [Sangeet]
[856.56] Hamna you are very bad
[863.04] and what do you think of yourself
[865.44] madam,
[871.48] I don't think much about myself now,
[874.28] someone should learn lying from you
[876.80] [Sangeet]
[879.72] at least my lie does not hurt anyone, does
[885.96] not insult anyone
[889.80] and does not put anyone to test,
[894.40] how would you
[897.68] know that you are a complete test for anyone
[901.19] [Sangeet]
[913.68] what is needed and what kind of a way is this of
[916.44] knocking on the door, you don't have any manners,
[919.96] tell me what you
[922.16] want, you ill-mannered person
[924.41] [Sangeet]
[925.88] sorry ji I have come to meet la, go
[932.44] tell her, her nephew came
[936.04] specially, first aunt and now this nephew, what drama have
[939.96] you guys created  There is no aunt of yours here, do you
[942.44] go or should I
[944.44] call the police, live as you please, by the way, aunt was right in
[948.92] saying that there is a hot chilli, there is a girl in this house
[953.00] and maybe she is you,
[955.24] hey, hey, what happened, none of my guests can come to
[958.68] this house, go to hell,
[960.72] you and your relatives, this is our house,
[963.32] none of your guests will come here,
[969.08] Allah, it seems you have not won the heart of your daughters yet,
[972.24] how many talkative
[975.84] daughters, my foot, by the way, salute
[979.96] to your mother who did not raise a girl like you, let it go, aunt, by the way, I have to tell you something
[987.52] important, miss, if you
[991.76] allow me, I will go, I do
[995.20] n't know what kind of wild and ignorant people I will have to see
[998.40] in my house, hey, just shut your mouth
[1000.60] and what are you saying, come
[1002.24] inside, close the door and come inside
[1005.11] [Sangeet]
[1017.48] come on,
[1019.24] if any work is done on time, then each
[1022.56] day it has to be paid a very heavy price,
[1028.48] I feel that I
[1030.72] gave a lot of time to our relationship
[1032.15] [Sangeet],
[1033.80] what did I
[1036.60] get in return, I am still standing at the same place from where I started,
[1040.76] I am not going to move forward
[1042.70] [Sangeet]
[1051.04] What do you complain about to me
[1056.36] But in this short time
[1059.32] your life has changed a lot Now
[1063.80] I cannot find myself in your eyes
[1065.72] [Sangeet]
[1070.44] Who forced
[1077.40] me to
[1082.84] understand the hands of the heart I will understand the heart
[1086.84] [Sangeet]
[1091.52] Ultimately this is what I will
[1094.92] do But still I want to explain to you one last time
[1098.43] [Sangeet]
[1103.60] Momina you have your own relations in front of you
[1106.24] and I am there
[1111.72] Choose one of them and get out of that dilemma
[1115.64] Sami uncle
[1119.40] Abhir it is not your responsibility
[1122.44] If you get out of his life it is
[1125.16] not going to make any difference to him
[1127.04] And
[1131.24] Sami how can I leave him in the lap of some strange woman Is
[1135.72] this not selfishness Ram Momina
[1139.28] he is your brother not your child
[1140.92] that you are getting so emotional and thinking what is your
[1143.36] problem
[1145.32] Uncle made his image zero for this Sami let
[1149.36] him live his life your
[1153.00] contribution is just over or nothing has
[1157.56] ended only your heart is upset
[1161.48] If you do not want to marry me then don't do it At
[1165.40] least do not insult the name of marriage
[1168.96] If you are forced by the hands of the heart then
[1171.92] I am also helpless,
[1177.24] if you can accept me with Sami, then it's
[1180.04] fine,
[1182.24] you have 24 hours,
[1185.84] if your answer is yes, then
[1190.28] we will meet again tomorrow
[1192.59] [Music]
[1197.24] I am leaving, Khuda Hafiz

[1208.08] Saj
[1210.36] [Music]
[1214.32] Sajna, today go, I will feed you fruits,
[1222.20] come, Khala, with such a hot girl, the
[1227.12] fun of living life is unique, one
[1229.84] never gets bored, there is always some
[1232.36] sugar or the other, oh brother,
[1236.16] this girl is another name for the biggest problem,
[1238.36] what should I tell you, sometimes I think that such a
[1242.16] gentleman, Abra Sahib, how did this monster come into his house, so
[1249.68] talk to Khalu, he will be happy about our relationship
[1253.60] and after all, he has to get both of them
[1255.80] married, I will talk to him,
[1258.48] but not now, sir, if the elder one's
[1261.60] marriage is also fixed, friend, both of them will be
[1264.12] together, Khala, why do you take so much tension,
[1270.76] by the way, this house is very big, whose is it, it is
[1276.08] mine, my Khala, does it mean that I don't
[1279.84] need to go to Dubai, yes, elder,
[1283.12] you should have gone to Dubai and become an officer, what did you have to do after
[1285.92] going there or  I had to work for some Sheikh today,
[1288.28] see, just wait, I will
[1292.28] talk to Abrar sahab, I will get money invested in your business, he will
[1295.04] benefit them as well as
[1297.60] you, this is what happened, khaala, and explain to
[1301.64] them that it is not in my business that they will benefit,
[1303.92] after all I am their brain,
[1306.24] oh friend, khaala, shut it up whenever you
[1309.44] see this siren keeps escaping, you have a right duty,
[1311.60] oh what should I do, it is so small
[1314.08] and look at its voice, how big it is, now the one who
[1316.32] handles it, I don't know where it has gone, this one who is
[1318.80] sitting inside, she does not handle it, I don't want to handle it, she is an
[1320.84] enemy, it is a
[1325.08] good thing that such girls do not
[1328.44] even do womanly things, she is a
[1330.92] girl of the class, if we become friends with her, it will be fun,
[1334.52] khaala, ok, khaala, I am leaving, this
[1337.08] siren of yours kept escaping, oh listen to me, sit down,
[1340.44] leave it, see, when Abrar sahab is not at home, do not
[1344.84] enter the house with such a raised face,
[1347.00] they do not like men with guards,
[1350.32] go and talk, I will
[1354.96] call them myself, I will invite them to dinner, come prepared and be
[1358.04] careful with me  Have respect, understand, it will happen, he will come as
[1361.56] your hero, it's all
[1364.56] right, let's go,

[1386.24] your problem, she will take care of you,

[1392.56] matter, your father puts it on me and goes away,

[1406.88] problem, I
[1410.12] drive, I don't pick up my calls, it's okay,
[1414.20] very soon a time will come when
[1418.56] you will not only pick up my calls,
[1422.48] but will also wait to meet me, what do you have to
[1429.36] do with me, you will drink coffee, I make very good coffee, I don't
[1433.16] drink coffee, me and I, you should
[1438.12] not even lie
[1439.79] [Music]
[1463.76] Come on, I want to eat, it's a little late for dinner, here,
[1468.68] let's start eating, I was putting your prince to sleep, he has
[1471.48] started bothering me so much, now if
[1475.24] his mother was alive, she would have inculcated the habit of sleeping on time,
[1477.08] now she is not there, well you will not
[1481.92] eat at home, I am very tired, you know there was
[1485.20] no light in the house the whole day and
[1487.64] while fanning your prince,
[1489.92] my hands fell down  My heart is restless, I don't feel like eating at all
[1492.52] and he has become so naughty,
[1494.84] Mashallah, he doesn't even sit on one bed, let me
[1496.68] lie down for a while,
[1500.48] eat one for company, I will eat alone with me,
[1503.48] what? Well,
[1505.28] you said the right thing,
[1512.24] come and take this,
[1514.76] eat hot rotis,

[1537.28] Samindra also there or not, I do
[1541.76] n't have to wait even to talk to you and all
[1544.24] the time, the smell of the child keeps coming from this room,
[1546.08] children have their own smell
[1549.68] and anyway, when you fall in love with him, then
[1552.00] you will feel his fragrance from a distance,
[1553.92] I don't want to feel anything and
[1557.36] my heart doesn't even want to
[1558.88] see his face, so go away,
[1560.88] why have you locked him in Amma's room, go and sleep
[1563.12] there, good idea, I will do this
[1567.40] and anyway, I have to ruin the life of that drama-loving woman as well,
[1571.96] relax, I am
[1573.92] still sleeping, my sleep has gone away, so
[1577.20] see, my sleep is very weak, it has
[1580.44] gone exactly on Amma
[1581.82] [Sangeet] do
[1583.20] you remember when
[1585.76] Amma was sleeping, how we used to
[1588.48] talk in whispers
[1591.20] And Ammi's sleep would still be disturbed
[1598.29] [Music]
[1604.92] I was thinking of one thing, the
[1608.52] sooner motherless girls become part of their
[1614.04] own family, the better it is.
[1617.00] See, the times are very bad. People must be
[1620.64] filling the ears of children with all sorts of things, that is why
[1622.48] they come and fight with you so much. What you are
[1627.16] saying is right, but maybe I also
[1632.96] say too much in anger, I should not say
[1635.96] anything. For God's sake, I don't know for
[1639.28] how many days the poor girl will be a guest in our house. When she
[1642.56] goes to her in-laws' house, she should have some good memories of her mother.
[1646.52] I am waiting for this only. I don't know
[1650.84] when that time will come. So what is there to be so sad about in this.
[1656.16] Look, I say that
[1661.20] along with Mamna, send Abir also. I have
[1664.52] seen a very good proposal. If you say so,
[1666.80] I will talk to him. You have started looking for proposals. So what is there to
[1669.92] look for in this? There is
[1673.00] my nephew Kasi, you have seen him. You have met him as
[1676.28] well. He is good looking, he is an educated
[1679.28] boy, he will keep our daughter happy. And
[1682.44] anyway, he takes two-three trips to Dubai in a year,
[1684.68] I think he is very fond of it.
[1688.40] Both of them made a very good pair. Well,
[1692.36] what kind of shop does he have? I mean, is he his
[1695.16] own or on rent? He does mobile
[1698.08] business, right now his shop is on
[1701.12] rent, but he is thinking of buying it. His
[1704.64] father has a lot of money. I had
[1708.00] adopted him when he was a child.
[1711.36] How could I have known that my fate was written with you?
[1715.44] I brought him up thinking he would be my support in old age.
[1718.12] And you know, my entire
[1721.92] life's earnings are his. I do
[1725.44] n't want anyone else to take responsibility of him. He is our own
[1728.20] child and if he gets married to a daughter of the house, it will be
[1731.16] good. Well, there is still
[1735.40] a lot of time for Abhir. I say, we should
[1738.08] find a good boy for Momna. She is
[1740.24] very sensitive and sensitive. She does
[1744.76] n't share her inner feelings with anyone. But she has a
[1748.72] relationship with you. I will never marry her off to Aaram.
[1752.80] Even if Afan comes and falls at my feet.
[1760.16] Well, it's good. I am
[1763.52] also in no hurry to get Momna married. If she gets married,
[1765.80] who will get their prince?
[1770.89] [Music]
[1796.32] Pani
[1802.09] [Music]
[1807.48] Hey, what broke down? Come, wait, wait.  What are you doing
[1810.28] in the kitchen at this time,
[1811.96] why have you come to the kitchen and what is this, have you gone
[1814.48] mad with my new dinner, what is this, what is this, this is what I am,
[1820.36] if you
[1822.44] talk about teaching me the lessons of humanity, this is what I will do to you,
[1824.56] oh you have gone mad, what can you do,
[1826.80] your mind is upset, yes
[1830.00] I am mad, when someone does drama in front of me, I get a fit
[1832.48] of madness, oh

[1837.32] I had brought it from my home, this
[1839.80] dinner set has just been ruined, oh brother, what happened, has a
[1842.32] cat spilled the milk,
[1844.04] I will tell you,
[1846.92] if you

[1852.04] and I will forget that you are my father
[1854.40] 's second wife

[1941.12] he has a habit of waking up on hearing the children's voice,
[1945.00] yes, he has such a habit, if the child breathes heavily,
[1948.56] my eyes open, it is only
[1950.92] because of you that I do not make him sleep with me, and
[1953.44] then look at both of them, how attached he is, Sam
