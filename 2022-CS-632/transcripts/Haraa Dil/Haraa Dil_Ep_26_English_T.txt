[45.20] but I want
[50.96] you to please forgive Atul aunty
[54.68] [Sangeet] and make
[57.32] her sleep
[66.12] No I cannot forgive that woman that woman has no
[69.64] heart she doesn't
[73.24] respect anyone she doesn't love
[77.28] anyone I will
[80.16] not forgive such a woman but she is
[83.52] Arham's mother I cannot see her suffering
[86.76] Arham has told you all this
[91.56] not to say and we have not said anything
[98.20] then why don't you come Arham why don't
[102.20] you take your
[105.48] things with you all his things are here
[108.92] since that day you have not
[113.40] come even once see
[116.56] Momna since the time I came to this house I got all your
[120.48] love and support the
[122.16] motherly love inside me has
[125.84] awakened I cannot see you in pain like this it

[150.77] [Sangeet]
[152.64] then I too will not forgive him
[155.26] [Sangeet]

[164.04] that you and I should be free from this case, in
[169.16] fact she would be very happy, she came to
[175.20] meet me, I have seen the feeling of victory in her eyes,
[182.44] mother has given me that it is nothing like that,
[185.24] Mama why do you think so and now
[188.84] I have a lot of experience in understanding people,
[192.60] I had told you that this girl will turn
[195.48] our lives upside down one day,
[198.00] see, it
[202.12] happened and those people with whom we are
[205.24] not at all a match, they change our fate,
[211.88] well, leave it, you don't worry, when I
[214.48] get bail, I will take care of everything myself,
[216.88] you do
[219.84] n't need to take any help from Momna or her step mother,

[266.48] Mamna
[268.60] ji
[273.52] and I wanted to tell you something,
[281.00] tell me the thing is that
[284.76] if you want me to
[288.08] forgive your Amtula aunty,
[291.92] then there is a condition for that,
[294.76] what kind of
[298.56] condition,
[301.20] I will go and see
[305.40] [Sangeet]
[309.68] who
[312.76] [Sangeet] is it
[321.37] [Sangeet]
[322.64] Sajna,
[327.56] Sajna, ca
[331.08] n't I come here, you
[333.92] can come,
[338.20] one relation with this house will always be there
[341.08] and the
[344.76] other  Secondly, you want to break it, I have
[348.40] come to make the same relationship
[351.60] again,
[353.72] but you have to agree to one thing of mine, are
[358.48] relationships made on the basis of shayari,
[361.92] no, this is not a condition, this is
[364.20] my wish, I
[367.00] want to give this relationship another chance,
[369.32] why, what has happened now, are you being
[374.88] jealous of me, no, I am not being jealous of you,
[381.00] when I go away from you, I do
[384.16] n't understand what to do, how to
[386.84] react, you have already reacted, so is it
[390.16] my fault,
[395.16] no, I should also be guilty of my mistake [
[397.98] Music]
[405.40] [Praise]
[405.66] [Music]
[416.12] Look Bhaisahab,
[420.36] I
[424.40] will talk about principles, now you should
[426.56] consider this a condition or a
[429.84] compromise, it is such that
[432.40] because of Sami,
[434.84] poor Momna could not settle down till date,
[439.24] Atul
[441.68] Begum would have accepted Momna in some way or the other,
[448.32] but she
[451.16] cannot tolerate Sami
[454.06] [Music], that is
[457.52] why I want
[463.60] you
[466.40] people to do whatever you have to do
[473.40] and hand over Sami to me
[480.62] [Music]
[482.00] I will raise him well, I promise, I will
[485.16] not
[487.16] let my children face any trouble  I will
[490.64] keep him like this, look
[493.44] brother my nephew Kasi was my only support
[498.68] and then Allah Pak will give Momna more children of her own
[505.64] but I am left empty handed so
[510.08] if you
[512.44] people give Sami to me to raise then
[518.08] I will
[525.86] [Music]
[554.48] I accept your condition [Music]

[630.66] Music]
[648.92] I
[654.24] could not give peace to my mother by snatching the peace of a mother's heart
[660.36] today Sami will
[663.80] stay with you becoming the biggest happiness of your life
[666.83] [Music] and
[669.88] both of you will stay with me
[672.47] [Music]
[674.48] stop my happiness and
[676.96] think, you cast an evil
[684.88] eye on both our companionship and my happiness,
[687.96] in two minutes you do it many times
[692.88] and in the third minute you are out of my life,
[696.28] you yourself are responsible for this
[699.48] because whenever I need you, you are
[704.56] not with me, you are not with me, it is
[708.80] just this small thing,
[715.08] it seems like such a small thing to you,
[720.64] listen sometimes I feel that you will lose me
[724.88] if you keep running away from me like this then you would have run
[728.24] away  You are cowards, do whatever you want to do.
[734.68] I am here in front of you.
[738.74] [Sangeet] I am ready to forgive
[745.96] anyone,
[750.64] but I also know that your heart does
[754.72] not think ill of anyone
[756.36] and you know the
[758.64] importance of forgiveness
[761.68] better than anyone else
[764.92] and no one knows the reward of forgiveness better than you.
[769.72] I know everything,
[773.92] but I don't know why I neither feel sorry for Atul,
[778.48] nor have you forgotten the pain.
[783.16] How did you hold Momna's hand and throw her out of the house
[789.04] and then pretend to divorce yourself?
[792.88] Such a woman should rot in jail for life.
[796.16] What will be the impact on Arham bhai and Aapi's life?
[798.96] Nothing will happen. We will not be there
[802.48] in their lives, both of them will be very happy.
[805.67] [Sangeet]
[807.76] Aunty,
[810.84] please don't forgive aunty.
[814.96] For you, she may be a woman,
[817.84] but for me, she is Arham's mother. I feel
[821.28] bad when you talk about her like this.
[831.63] [Sangeet]
[833.12] So, brother, your sister is neither the world's
[836.80] unique child, nor is there anyone like her, nor will there
[839.68] be. You are absolutely right. There is
[842.84] no one like me and you.  I will
[844.08] come after seeing
[849.59] [sangeet]
[860.40] I knew that this would be the answer of that woman In
[865.08] fact this is not the answer of that woman
[869.92] but Momna has
[872.16] played her last card to let me down
[874.52] I had even refused and told us
[877.96] not to mention this to anyone but Mama are
[881.68] you happier staying here
[884.64] You still feel that those people are wrong
[888.28] and you are right Do
[889.84] you have any idea what
[893.16] people talk about us
[896.20] Because of those people you have
[902.24] created some issue or the other in the life of Momina and Aram
[904.12] and you know what those people say about you
[908.32] Al's mind has gone crazy
[917.44] Mama I have heard all this with my own ears
[921.00] and that is why I am telling you
[925.12] that maybe tomorrow you will get bail
[930.32] then how will you face all those people
[933.28] You have only tonight to think about it [
[941.19] sangeet]
[947.84] You are
[950.08] all fine here
[956.52] Yes
[959.96] I forgive Atul Begum for killing Kashif
[965.52] Let it be her foster son but he was my
[969.68] son after all It
[971.36] pains a lot
[975.00] but what she did was
[978.28] also not right If
[982.64] you want I can be a judge  I am ready to go and testify in front of the Qazi.
[990.56] Atul
[992.00] Sahiba will be released after my testimony
[995.04] and after the Qazi action,
[999.32] this stain will also be removed from him forever,
[1003.76] but in return for that
[1007.32] [sangeet]
[1009.68] I
[1012.56] want a heavy price from you. Tell me what do you want?
[1022.76] Momna's
[1025.52] happiness and all the happiness that
[1028.24] she should have
[1030.94] [sangeet]
[1032.28] and her father's lot
[1034.96] [sangeet]
[1036.48] I want that her father's face gets
[1039.28] peace
[1042.24] and I am also giving peace to my heart.
[1046.88] Now
[1050.12] I have decided this after a lot of thinking.
[1055.00] You will pay my price,
[1058.36] right? Don't worry at all.
[1061.44] Thank you so
[1065.00] much. I will give more than the price you have asked for
[1068.57] [sangeet]
[1070.92] Thank you
[1073.12] one. Take care of yourself
[1082.73] [sangeet]
[1089.16] Mamma, why is it so difficult?
[1092.76] Unreasonable, unpractical.
[1095.72] So much has happened but her thinking has
[1100.08] not become
[1101.36] weak. You and I have become empty because of her absence.
[1110.04] This house has become empty.
[1111.84] Our life has become empty.
[1115.92] Maybe she does not even realize this.
[1118.88] [sangeet] She will
[1120.56] definitely realize it,
[1124.68] son. But she will never let herself become weak in front of us.
[1129.76] I know her very well.  She will
[1133.32] die
[1136.76] but will never reveal her weakness.
[1140.80] Nobody likes such a person.
[1143.80] Nobody likes Mama. Those who used to follow her around
[1151.12] today call her a psycho patient. Well,
[1155.64] Inshallah,
[1162.36] she will get bail tomorrow and I am hopeful that she will take
[1166.84] care of herself soon.
[1171.72] If you were not so good, then why would we have any problem? Husband and
[1178.36] wife are each other's cover.
[1182.76] Son, if there is any shortcoming in someone, then the
[1186.24] other person must take care of it. Only
[1190.80] then do relations remain strong
[1193.54] [sangeet]
[1194.92] otherwise there are quarrels, son, there are
[1199.52] quarrels in relations.
[1205.20] Everything will be fine
[1207.32] [sangeet]
[1218.52] How are you? I am fine. How are you
[1224.08] and how is Fiza? That too is fine.
[1229.12] You have not slept yet. I cannot sleep these days.
[1232.88] Ever since Mama has gone, the house has become completely
[1237.20] empty. It seems that nobody lives here. Do
[1240.20] n't worry. And I am
[1244.04] hopeful that aunty will get released soon. She
[1247.20] may get released
[1249.04] but she will not be normal like before.
[1252.08] I am afraid that she might
[1256.32] go away from us. Don't worry, don't worry and be
[1260.20] a strong woman. Everything will be fine.
[1263.32] Inshallah it's okay now you can sleep right okay
[1272.24] [Music]
[1282.60] Bye thank god all the trouble is over

[1306.76] innocence in your eyes but

[1320.72] and on top of that I don't know what wrong
[1323.72] thoughts I was giving myself trouble by thinking
[1329.12] now I will never think of such a thing again

[1464.48] think they will all get sorted out
[1468.48] if we both give time to each other,
[1472.76] understand each other, agree to each other's words. What things should we agree to
[1477.68] after giving the divorce? What things does he
[1479.72] want us to agree to?
[1482.08] Mama, there is scope for reunion in our divorce.
[1488.24] I want to go from here with my husband.
[1492.48] Where do you want to go? Are you in your senses?
[1496.76] You are absolutely in your senses. Alright,
[1500.76] son. If you have
[1504.12] decided to settle down with your husband with full honesty,
[1506.72] then Allah will surely help you.

[1513.68] Allah keep you happy with your husband forever,
[1519.08] son.

[2076.26] [Music]
[2080.16] But how can I let you lose
[2086.92] [Praise]
[2089.85] [Music]
[2091.02] [Praise]
[2095.88] Son

[2162.31] [Music] Sajna Sajna Sajna Sajna
[2185.72] Sajna There was
[2190.56] only one thing missing and

[2195.96] Ammi
[2198.60] Baba I know that today you will be very happy in the heavens
[2203.48] Now I have no regrets in my life I had
[2207.44] only lost my heart
[2211.48] Your prayers made the victory of love my
[2214.44] destiny
[2217.76] And
[2218.72] today today the tomb of this love has been completed
[2223.28] Perhaps someone has rightly said that if the
[2227.88] heart loses, it wins everything
[2230.24] Respect,
[2233.24] trust and the love of an angry mother
[2237.20] and I dedicate every moment of this victory to your
[2241.52] love and forgiveness, O
[2244.32] Allah, please keep me
[2247.44] in your blessings always
[2251.27] [Music]
