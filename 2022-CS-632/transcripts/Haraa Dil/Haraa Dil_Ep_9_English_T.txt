[233.20] Sami should return home safely you
[235.84] know I spent the life of an orphan
[238.48] I cannot see the pain of a child I was about to come
[244.60] as soon as Zeba told me that
[247.60] Sami has returned I was about to come
[249.72] then I thought you kept hanging on Suri the whole day
[252.08] take some rest by the way our prince is fine he is fine right

[322.00] Bir do
[326.04] you remember how we used to wake up in the morning  She used to come and wake us up in the morning
[330.64] and then to tease her we used to
[333.80] put a pillow on our ears and would not get up
[337.88] and today my eyes open at the slightest sound
[343.08] [Music] Do you
[347.72] know,
[350.16] sometimes I also think
[352.96] that I wish Ammi would have stayed with us for a few more days
[361.60] when I think that everything is going to be fine
[364.12] something or the other goes wrong I am also
[368.32] afraid that the
[370.12] memories of Ammi may also leave this house
[374.88] [Music]
[376.80] I will not let that happen
[379.64] Aapi this is our mother's house and
[386.52] ours Abraaj sahab I will check Sami to make sure that he has got
[390.00] any injury or maybe he has got
[392.00] any internal injury and now I have
[395.56] come you need not worry
[398.16] [Music]
[411.32] No Quite a filmy
[415.48] situation the child got kidnapped the
[418.40] police raided the railway station
[421.68] and found the child you too
[425.48] in which world do you live I don't know which
[428.16] people fool you
[430.28] D Mama you are right the police
[434.36] found the child in a single day and that
[436.64] too in this city where children are born every day
[439.68] and nothing happens to them  I don't even know.
[442.28] Look, I don't want to talk on this topic. It is not an
[444.60] easy task to make you both understand.
[447.56] You too Afan. Abrar Hasan had created this drama to garner sympathy and money from you,
[454.84] but he could not succeed in this drama
[457.00] because you yourself
[460.32] reached there with the police. Anyway, I have told you
[463.40] that I don't want to talk on this topic.
[465.76] I know such people very well. Make the
[468.92] child disappear for two-four days yourself
[471.80] and then create a drama so that you
[477.00] reach there with the money for the tawa. Because
[479.36] you are always a soft-hearted person and
[482.52] they know this. And the money that you take would
[485.80] go straight into Abrar Hasan's pocket.
[492.60] You had told me that he has lost his job, so
[497.24] even in unemployment his mind
[500.72] works a lot. It is impossible to make you understand.
[511.64] Hello, yes
[513.68] Fiza, how are you? Your son was
[516.56] telling me that you have fallen ill because of the exams.
[520.24] Well, you are fine now. Thank God. Well, listen,
[524.24] tell me when are you coming? Next
[528.20] week. Well, just come soon. I am
[531.40] missing you a lot.  I am
[533.52] okay my love okay Khuda
[538.20] Hafiz
[541.40] that Mama does so much drama, isn't it,
[546.76] in this world everyone is a drama queen
[548.86] [Sangeet],
[558.92] after what happened yesterday I am very scared,
[562.60] such people are waiting with their eyes on everyone and
[566.92] how long will I keep guarding Sami, the
[570.80] nanny is not even aware, don't make this mistake again
[574.24] sister, I am thinking
[578.60] of sending Sami to a day care center,
[582.28] what happened brother, day
[585.68] care people cannot take care of such a small child properly,
[588.60] your child has got a second life
[590.97] [Sangeet], for
[593.12] his life I
[597.40] can give my life, there is no need for you to give your life,
[600.04] Sami, think what to do next,
[604.40] I don't have even an iota of hope from your daughters,
[609.36] despite all this, they don't even realize, didn't you
[612.00] see how she was sitting with her room closed
[614.26] [Sangeet],
[618.80] I have only one solution to your problem,
[623.36] I had told you this before and I am
[626.76] saying it today also, you should get married otherwise your
[631.56] child will cry,
[633.44] oh
[636.56] sister, even when there is a step mother, the children
[639.52] cry,
[640.88] right, and now
[643.40] So even Shagufta's scattered belongings have not been
[647.96] gathered and you are asking me to give her place to
[650.68] someone else. No, I am not asking you to give her place to someone else.
[653.12] She was the mother of your child and will
[656.08] always be. It
[657.36] feels good to think about it.
[660.88] In reality, a mother is needed to raise a child,
[663.04] even if she is a step mother.
[666.72] Now see, after a few days Abir and Momna will get
[670.64] married, after that you will have to do everything yourself
[678.10] [sangeet]
[686.36] I realize that you
[690.80] think well of me,
[694.84] but I have two young daughters. This is their
[698.52] marriageable age and both of them are already angry with me.
[702.36] And then the truth is, I feel
[705.76] ashamed thinking about marriage. I am asking
[709.44] you to get married. It is
[712.40] not a crime to get married again under compulsion.
[715.72] This situation has come because of your daughters.
[718.12] What do you think? I may not have explained to her.
[720.56] She did not even talk to me. I don't
[722.92] know what is her stubbornness about this child.
[726.28] [sangeet]
[728.64] She has no attachment to this child
[732.56] and is only punishing me.
[736.88] In this process of punishment, your child will go into the wrong hands,
[740.88] brother Brar. And
[743.08] then whether the mother sleeps or not, she will take care of the children.  She will scold and
[747.52] beat me but she will keep it in front of her
[757.52] and there can't be a better mother for your child than Funny
[763.78] [Sangeet]
[791.28] Sit down, it seems life has taken me back 20-20 years. Do
[796.48] you remember when I was about to become pregnant,
[801.24] I had become extremely fat and the doctor had
[804.52] asked me to go for a walk but
[807.16] you used to die because of my walk because you had to do it
[812.16] with me, you know, I used to repeatedly remind myself that
[816.04] Brar
[819.44] Miya, I have promised to support you for life
[824.04] and you get scared of even a little walk,
[831.28] you kept your promise very well
[834.44] and you are still keeping it, I
[839.60] wonder that I don't know for which
[842.60] good deed of mine that Allah has given me you, for
[845.44] God's sake, don't talk
[849.20] such big things, I start feeling
[852.32] embarrassed
[853.76] [Sangeet] I
[861.72] loved you a lot
[864.88] but
[869.16] perhaps something was lacking in appreciating you, I
[872.36] realize this,
[876.04] I have two daughters and now a son and
[882.80] with you, my life is full of happiness
[886.72] and what else am I lacking,
[894.92] wife, are you really happy
[900.44] It is the burden of happiness that does not let me get tired.
[906.04] This time is very difficult
[909.19] [Music] It is
[919.16] really a very difficult time.
[924.24] Forgive me,
[930.52] my love has lost to
[933.04] my helplessness.
[935.49] [Music] I am
[946.76] thinking of living in this house of yours with your memories.
[949.98] [Music] I
[951.76] forgive me, forgive me,
[955.48] forgive
[968.36] me
[970.72] [
[988.92] Music]
[999.92] I cannot give you your mother. There must
[1006.84] be some woman who will love you like a mother. A
[1017.48] woman is a mother,
[1025.44] she fulfills her duty till her death.
[1037.28] Forgive me, forgive me
[1044.99] [Music] Your
[1050.04] heart is looking very lovely. It must have come from my in-laws' house.
[1052.32] Oh no, it is my own.
[1055.84] Nothing came from my in-laws' house. I will recover everything after going to my in-laws' house.
[1061.28] Pammi, you are looking so lovely. Mashallah, you are
[1064.48] looking very beautiful. Thank you. Okay,
[1067.84] listen, tell me, have you talked to your brother? Have you
[1071.12] told him all my conditions?
[1074.08] Because, see,
[1075.76] I have done exactly as he said. Now, he will have to do exactly as I said.
[1077.92] Yes, yes,
[1080.64] I told him everything. He did not get any
[1083.08] objection on any matter.  No, you will be happy with him your whole life.
[1087.32] Well, that's a good thing.
[1089.76] But one thing
[1091.84] is, I am afraid that his daughter will
[1099.44] spend her entire life remembering her dead wife. Because I ca
[1101.52] n't trust your words. You are
[1103.28] 100% devoted to him. Tell me, I am
[1106.76] very scared of such decent people.
[1109.16] Why, what disease are you the cure for?
[1112.60] You don't know how to control a husband. How do
[1114.20] I know? Yes, but I will learn from you.

[1653.72] mutual matter,
[1656.64] I didn't understand anything about your marriage.
[1660.04] And when you had to live in the same house even after marriage, you should have
[1665.04] made a simple deal to raise the child. And the face is also your own choice. Do you feel
[1668.96] ashamed or not? What do you think I
[1670.60] made a deal? Hey, did she have any compulsions?
[1673.60] Anyway, I felt pity for that child.
[1678.28] Oh, what should I tell you. The motherless child had
[1681.48] become a tennis ball. Sometimes here, sometimes there.
[1685.48] Well, this is a very difficult task for you.
[1688.84] Take care of the children, brother. As per your
[1692.04] wish. When is the departure scene, brother?
[1696.64] Owner, you will have to give notice to the house as well.

[1721.52] take me from here, I don't want
[1724.72] any mischief to happen and then there is some affair going on regarding the marriage of their elder daughter too,
[1733.00] how are their daughters by the way, they are very
