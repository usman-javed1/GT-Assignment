[Music] No, now maybe you will forgive yourself [Music ] But I will never be able to do this [Music] Take care of yourself, the values ​​of relationships are not easy, all false stories are not easy God, you have forgotten the memories, the heart is lost, the heart is lost, the heart is lost, the heart is lost, the heart is lost, the heart is lost, the heart is not able to talk to him Momina, you were not talking to me for a long time, you were facing problems, that's why you came here to talk to him, yes, you did a good thing, but where are you going, you won't sit? What's the matter, you seem upset to me, Aram has said something to you No, I was strong [Music] Mamna, can I tell you one thing, you can also say it [Music] Take it, a lot has changed in life, this house is yours [Music] Momna, if possible, forget all the past things [Music] You should come back to this house I have forgotten all the past things This house is mine You will forget this too [Music] Should I tell you one thing It has been so many days we have n't said anything since a single day Neither good nor bad I can see the feeling of something being lost in your eyes And I know this feeling neither lets you live nor die If you get any chance to go back [Music] or to revive the relationship, do n't let Ana come in between This Ana deprives a person [Music] of everything and love and then only regret is left [Music] Thank you so much Momna for understanding me I am leaving [Music] [Music] Bibi, this is your breakfast [Music] [Praise] [Music] I can't believe how this could happen to aunty Even Mama must not be able to believe it till now What happened to her, you guys did that to some policeman  Have you talked to him or have you got a lawyer, if you say so I will talk to him, I know a lawyer, he is very expert in his work, maybe he can change the direction of this case, I have no idea who I am talking to, but dad and Aram are contacting different people, right now the only thing is that Mama's jail should fail soon, I do n't know what condition she would be in there, I do n't know how she would be living there, don't worry, you are not worried, whatever aunty has done, she has done it for her self-defense and this was the punishment for that criminal, if aunty had not done this then someone else would have killed him, but I am not able to understand one thing that till now why has Afan uncle not got aunty's interim bill done, Mama has not said anything to anyone [sangeet] but still A uncle and Arham should have done something, Mama did everything herself, went to the police station and confessed, anyway I am going to meet aunty, will you come with me, on what right should I come with you, the divorce papers are kept in my room, you have done them  Did you sign the papers? Have you accepted the divorce? No, you still have all the rights. [Music] I ask you once again, will you come with me? Okay, why have you come here? I am waiting to meet you. I have come only to fulfill my duty. Aunty, this is not your duty, nor do I need it. Do you understand? And there is no need to come here again? Aunty, for you, every relationship is necessary, but I remember my duty and debt. You took the trouble that came upon Arham upon yourself. You have given him a new life, and he has given me to me. You are the foundation of every relationship with Arham. Whether Arham is with you or not, he will always be yours. That's why my heart will always be for both of you. [Music] I am leaving. [Music] [Music ] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Prashant] Aapi, has something happened to Aram bhai again? I told him to have lunch with us, but he refused. You know that he is alone at home. Who would be taking care of his food and drink? I am worried.  He must be busy somewhere, Bir Aapi, if he was busy, he would have told me, then why are you asking me? Ask him yourself, tell me what has happened to me. He would never get angry with you like this. He has not one but a thousand reasons to get angry with me. What has happened Aapi, he has told you something. He says that whatever has happened, the reason for it is only [Music] me, only [ Music] [Music] what happened in the second baa [Music] listen, don't worry aunty, it will be alright soon, but you should talk to Kas's family, if they take back the case or the court makes a deal with us, then the case will be over, how can this happen in the law, what should I talk to them, there is definitely a price for everything, don't give Kas's family the life of his life and end the matter, so is it so easy? It is not so easy but it is not so difficult either, I don't know friend, till yesterday, nothing seemed difficult to me, but things have become so complicated that I am unable to understand what to do, don't isolate yourself so much, we all are with you and you  I guarantee that Momna will also support you, if you talk to her once, you will definitely get this problem out of hand.
