Now from where did this come in my life? I have told you that I do not want to get married. I feel that getting me married has become the most important mission of your life. Ca n't we both talk about any other topic? Well, thank God you have accepted that one chapter of yours has closed. That too you have done on your own, with your own will, with your own happiness. Now what is your regret? I do not regret anything. I do not want to discuss all these things again. That's it. [Sangeet] Please find a good match for Fiza from your circle and get her married. If she has given you the authority to get her married. [Sangeet] Otherwise she is an independent girl. She can take her own decision very well. You do not need to show so much concern. But she is concerned about you. How can I ignore this fact? I can see that she likes you, she is happy with you and you are also comfortable with her. Then what is the issue, Mamma? You are so concerned about my marriage.  I have never understood the practical approach in the past and probably never will in the future If I am comfortable with her, it does n't at all mean that I will be happy even after marriage, friend Practical approach is what makes life, otherwise you wouldn't be standing at this crossroads today See, being a girl, how easily she parted ways with you You know what, my words will sound bitter to you, but because it is a compulsion, listen to me My paths and Momina's have definitely parted, but my feelings for her will take time to go away I don't want to put the burden of any relationship on myself, and I don't need it either Aram Fard Sekram What is there in that worthless girl that does n't go away from your heart and mind Because of her, you are repeatedly refusing me, going against my decision For God's sake, stop this drama Her interest in you has completely ended, but your madness remains the same Please move on Aram Her interest has not ended, Mama, her interest has changed  I do n't want to live without Sami, so I have told her that I will not accept her with Sami, so it's okay, raise your brother as a mother, one has to suffer for the deeds of one's parents, but for God's sake, you should come out of this story, see Fiza will prove to be the best life partner for you, trust me, I will wait for your answer and does Fiza also know what you are planning for her, of course, I have proposed to you only after talking to her and the truth is that I also always had this desire and I feel that Fiza has come back only for you, otherwise there was no dearth of relationships for her there, this is the issue, you see everyone's relationships in the world, you realize everyone, but when it comes to me, you don't realize, there are brokers [sangeet] [sangeet], aunty, why are you getting so upset and why are you forcing Arham so much to marry me, I know how to handle him and everything will be fine, all this is not so easy, she is a very clever girl and Arham's helplessness  She is taking advantage of him. Then some day she will come with her compulsions and then my son will be kind to her. I am waiting for that time when Arham gets suspicious of her. You must have that girl's number. I am the one who is trapped in my ex. You must be talking to her. You need the number as well as the permission to talk to her. But why are you thinking? [Sangeet] Do n't worry at all. I have heard that these middle class girls are very sensitive when it comes to their self-respect. [Sangeet] I will handle him. [Prashant] Now I have no tension. I know that you can handle Arham well. [Sangeet] I have known him since childhood. He is not as stubborn as you people have made him. [Sangeet] And he is so naughty that when you talk to him, he will cry and if I make him quiet, he will not keep quiet. Then he will keep on speaking. Yes, of course, I may have come early. No, Haram, you have come at the right time. Come, sit down. You guys do it. I will meet you later. We will definitely meet later.  But now it is important for both of you to meet and talk, all the relationships, all the reasons have ended and I did not do this because what should I talk to him, what was the need for you to do all this drama, I would have gone myself Momna yaar please [ __ ] off, both of you leave your childishness now, sit down, you guys talk, let's talk for the last time yaar please sit down for my sake, I have some important work so I am leaving [Sangeet] Hamna you are very bad and what do you think of yourself madam, I don't think much about myself now, someone should learn lying from you [Sangeet] at least my lie does not hurt anyone, does not insult anyone and does not put anyone to test, how would you know that you are a complete test for anyone [Sangeet] what is needed and what kind of a way is this of knocking on the door, you don't have any manners, tell me what you want, you ill-mannered person [Sangeet] sorry ji I have come to meet la, go tell her, her nephew came specially, first aunt and now this nephew, what drama have you guys created  There is no aunt of yours here, do you go or should I call the police, live as you please, by the way, aunt was right in saying that there is a hot chilli, there is a girl in this house and maybe she is you, hey, hey, what happened, none of my guests can come to this house, go to hell, you and your relatives, this is our house, none of your guests will come here, Allah, it seems you have not won the heart of your daughters yet, how many talkative daughters, my foot, by the way, salute to your mother who did not raise a girl like you, let it go, aunt, by the way, I have to tell you something important, miss, if you allow me, I will go, I do n't know what kind of wild and ignorant people I will have to see in my house, hey, just shut your mouth and what are you saying, come inside, close the door and come inside [Sangeet] come on, if any work is done on time, then each day it has to be paid a very heavy price, I feel that I gave a lot of time to our relationship [Sangeet], what did I get in return, I am still standing at the same place from where I started, I am not going to move forward [Sangeet] What do you complain about to me But in this short time your life has changed a lot Now I cannot find myself in your eyes [Sangeet] Who forced me to understand the hands of the heart I will understand the heart [Sangeet] Ultimately this is what I will do But still I want to explain to you one last time [Sangeet] Momina you have your own relations in front of you and I am there Choose one of them and get out of that dilemma Sami uncle Abhir it is not your responsibility If you get out of his life it is not going to make any difference to him And Sami how can I leave him in the lap of some strange woman Is this not selfishness Ram Momina he is your brother not your child that you are getting so emotional and thinking what is your problem Uncle made his image zero for this Sami let him live his life your contribution is just over or nothing has ended only your heart is upset If you do not want to marry me then don't do it At least do not insult the name of marriage If you are forced by the hands of the heart then I am also helpless, if you can accept me with Sami, then it's fine, you have 24 hours, if your answer is yes, then we will meet again tomorrow [Music] I am leaving, Khuda Hafiz [Music] Saj [Music] Sajna, today go, I will feed you fruits, come, Khala, with such a hot girl, the fun of living life is unique, one never gets bored, there is always some sugar or the other, oh brother, this girl is another name for the biggest problem, what should I tell you, sometimes I think that such a gentleman, Abra Sahib, how did this monster come into his house, so talk to Khalu, he will be happy about our relationship and after all, he has to get both of them married, I will talk to him, but not now, sir, if the elder one's marriage is also fixed, friend, both of them will be together, Khala, why do you take so much tension, by the way, this house is very big, whose is it, it is mine, my Khala, does it mean that I don't need to go to Dubai, yes, elder, you should have gone to Dubai and become an officer, what did you have to do after going there or  I had to work for some Sheikh today, see, just wait, I will talk to Abrar sahab, I will get money invested in your business, he will benefit them as well as you, this is what happened, khaala, and explain to them that it is not in my business that they will benefit, after all I am their brain, oh friend, khaala, shut it up whenever you see this siren keeps escaping, you have a right duty, oh what should I do, it is so small and look at its voice, how big it is, now the one who handles it, I don't know where it has gone, this one who is sitting inside, she does not handle it, I don't want to handle it, she is an enemy, it is a good thing that such girls do not even do womanly things, she is a girl of the class, if we become friends with her, it will be fun, khaala, ok, khaala, I am leaving, this siren of yours kept escaping, oh listen to me, sit down, leave it, see, when Abrar sahab is not at home, do not enter the house with such a raised face, they do not like men with guards, go and talk, I will call them myself, I will invite them to dinner, come prepared and be careful with me  Have respect, understand, it will happen, he will come as your hero, it's all right, let's go, you just shut up, what's so strange, come, you cry so much, come, come to me, what's your problem, she will take care of you, come, what's the matter, your father puts it on me and goes away, finally, I have been waiting for you since so long, why were you not picking up my calls, what's my problem, I drive, I don't pick up my calls, it's okay, very soon a time will come when you will not only pick up my calls, but will also wait to meet me, what do you have to do with me, you will drink coffee, I make very good coffee, I don't drink coffee, me and I, you should not even lie [Music] Come on, I want to eat, it's a little late for dinner, here, let's start eating, I was putting your prince to sleep, he has started bothering me so much, now if his mother was alive, she would have inculcated the habit of sleeping on time, now she is not there, well you will not eat at home, I am very tired, you know there was no light in the house the whole day and while fanning your prince, my hands fell down  My heart is restless, I don't feel like eating at all and he has become so naughty, Mashallah, he doesn't even sit on one bed, let me lie down for a while, eat one for company, I will eat alone with me, what? Well, you said the right thing, come and take this, eat hot rotis, thank you, go to sleep, Samimi [Sangeet] is Samindra also there or not, I do n't have to wait even to talk to you and all the time, the smell of the child keeps coming from this room, children have their own smell and anyway, when you fall in love with him, then you will feel his fragrance from a distance, I don't want to feel anything and my heart doesn't even want to see his face, so go away, why have you locked him in Amma's room, go and sleep there, good idea, I will do this and anyway, I have to ruin the life of that drama-loving woman as well, relax, I am still sleeping, my sleep has gone away, so see, my sleep is very weak, it has gone exactly on Amma [Sangeet] do you remember when Amma was sleeping, how we used to talk in whispers And Ammi's sleep would still be disturbed [Music] I was thinking of one thing, the sooner motherless girls become part of their own family, the better it is. See, the times are very bad. People must be filling the ears of children with all sorts of things, that is why they come and fight with you so much. What you are saying is right, but maybe I also say too much in anger, I should not say anything. For God's sake, I don't know for how many days the poor girl will be a guest in our house. When she goes to her in-laws' house, she should have some good memories of her mother. I am waiting for this only. I don't know when that time will come. So what is there to be so sad about in this. Look, I say that along with Mamna, send Abir also. I have seen a very good proposal. If you say so, I will talk to him. You have started looking for proposals. So what is there to look for in this? There is my nephew Kasi, you have seen him. You have met him as well. He is good looking, he is an educated boy, he will keep our daughter happy. And anyway, he takes two-three trips to Dubai in a year, I think he is very fond of it. Both of them made a very good pair. Well, what kind of shop does he have? I mean, is he his own or on rent? He does mobile business, right now his shop is on rent, but he is thinking of buying it. His father has a lot of money. I had adopted him when he was a child. How could I have known that my fate was written with you? I brought him up thinking he would be my support in old age. And you know, my entire life's earnings are his. I do n't want anyone else to take responsibility of him. He is our own child and if he gets married to a daughter of the house, it will be good. Well, there is still a lot of time for Abhir. I say, we should find a good boy for Momna. She is very sensitive and sensitive. She does n't share her inner feelings with anyone. But she has a relationship with you. I will never marry her off to Aaram. Even if Afan comes and falls at my feet. Well, it's good. I am also in no hurry to get Momna married. If she gets married, who will get their prince? [Music] Pani [Music] Hey, what broke down? Come, wait, wait.
