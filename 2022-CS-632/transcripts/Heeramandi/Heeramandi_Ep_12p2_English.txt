Now, how will you become a big man? Come on, how will you become? Your name has been cut off from school. They won't let you step in again. You were born for this day, now you become a courtesan, tie your anklets and dance. Bastard, curse on you. Why did I give birth to you, why didn't I kill you in my stomach? I should have poisoned myself and you too. Come on, I won't leave you now. You’ve ended up being just like everyone else. Shame on you. I ended up being insulted there Why am I working so hard and earning money if it’s not benefits you, if you have to become a transgender or courtesan, than do. What are you doing?Come on, pick up your things, Hey Guddu Guddu Guddu, where are you going, Guddu. Don't study, my prince, have fun and dance. Who here has seen the school and which Chief Minister do you want to become? Your mother is crazy, I will talk to her. No, I don't want to go to her, she will hit me again. I will stay with you only in your room. Now no one will argue with me. But what happened? My teacher made me dirty, I had gone with musical anklet, I was dancing she lodged a complaint there against me They cut off my name from school. Mother hit me all the way to home. Look at me, see how much she has hit. Oh, there are even fingerprints here, man. Now how can I go? Hey Guddu, Hey Guddu, come on, your mother is calling you. I will not go, she beat me so much, she will hit me again. She will not hit you, I guarantee. Come.  leave him, check his back. All marks there, now what else she want.  Your mother wants to make you a big man, my child. I'm a small man, I'm fine, I don't want to be a big man. Listen to me, she is your mother. Who can love, she can also hit you. She has the right. No, I won't go and she is not my mother any more. Oh, don't talk nonsense, I will break your teeth. Go lafray, he is angry, once he will cool down he will come. Okay, fine I am leaving, are you coming? You go, I will come later. Okay, Go quickly to your mother. Hey, who is he to scold me? He is ... He is your uncle. Call him uncle. He hates this name. Well see how I tease him in the name of Uncle. That's like my Boy. You sit here, now rest, I have to meet a customer. I will come with you if he come in your absence, he will drag me to home. Okay, come on, you too have to learn one day, how to handle a customer. Come on, let's go. Why are you making your life difficult by crying? I wish aunty I had listened to you. Now I will cry all my life. There was a hope that his father would come back. Why are you holding on to such hope? Respected people do not return after giving birth to a child. Respected people do not think what a doom a night spent in their brothel brings, their blood gets spilled in this filth Once I find Sheram, he accepts me or not I just want to hand over Guddu to him, so that his blood won't gets raise in this filth. Even if he comes to know about it, he will not take him. These noble people commit crimes in the dark and in the morning light they forget that their crimes are thriving in that darkness So control yourself, Throw that man out of your mind and think of Guddu, he will support you in your old age. I will explain it to him. But Chanda, don't hit him. Lafra says right now, he is small, when he grows up, he will understand himself. Oh God! Give my son sense or give me death. What kind of things are you talking?  I am getting scared in the name of death, by the way, this brothel is empty now, you will talk like this, it will completely destroy  So do I like to talk like this? You have no idea how much I have been insulted in school. I was always ashamed of being a courtesan, but today I have never felt so much shame in my life. The principal and teacher of the school were saying so proudly that we are decent people. Your child can't study here. I want so much in my heart to say that I too am as noble as you but I can't say that aunty. Please stop, my heart is worried, why are you seek in the outside world? The place where you were born You should kill yourself in the same well, otherwise people outside will kill you. Come on, get up and get fresh. Everything will be fine. Go now I will talk to him.  [Music]    [Music] [Music] May I sit here? Why? I want to talk to you. Sit down Have you seen fairies? this long hair, these intoxicating eyes, the lips like rose petals and when she speaks, bell rings If a man sees then he will be totally surprised. Wait for me outside; I’ll come after I pay my bills See, this is how we do. No cheating with my commission Vodka. Hey, where did your commission come from? You have started cheating on me. I am not cheating you. I quoted Rs 500. Hey, otherwise you were taking 200 only. Okay, I will give you something, at least let the customer bring the money first.  [Music] If there is still a good girl in you, then it's my duty that I will take you out of this mess and take you to my home. Will you wait for me? I might take few days to come back to you, I will talk to my parents and than take you. Believe me, I will definitely come. Till then you Keep this money for expenses so that you don't face any compulsion. Wait for me, Sir, you are sure that you will come back? Yes, I am sure. You will not forget? No I don't want money sir. I will wait for you. Imagine that a girl named Chanda will be waiting for you. Neither will she sleep nor will she die. You also remember  A boy named Sheram promised you that he will return to give you a good life. [Music] Give me my commission. Have patience I am giving you take this. Yours Rs 100. take this, what will you remember Mother, after becoming big man I will earn a lot. but I have started earning from now. She will be so happy to know this. Okay, you promise that whenever you go to get a customer, you will definitely take me along. Okay Prince, I will take you along, but next time you have to talk to the customer as well. You have to trap the customer. I will do better than you, you just see. By the way Prince, you have lost this money in cards   Give me my money back Come inside, come inside. I will hit you badly If I saw you again I will break your legs. Take him away from here. what has happened? Why are you both hitting him. You want to take his life? Go to Zeenat room. Go inside. Now tell me, what he has done?  Husna Bai, he was bringing customers. He had started it. I said that he will not improve. What do you think? A child brought up in a brothel will do something else. Hey, he will do only what he sees. What you are trying to make an urban boy, don't  dream like this. A frog's baby remains a frog and does not become a flying bird. Move   Chanda Chanda, my love, see and listen to me. By the way Chanda, Husna Bai was absolutely true. Was she right? Oh look what she is saying is that we are trying to make frog baby a bird. This is not going to happen, By the way, I have started thinking about one more thing, neither would you have a child nor would you get sorrow. Or else we would have gone away from here, I mean, leave it, why are you spoiling your heart, leave him on his own. How leave? and my dreams, I have reached here. I send him to school,   counsel him all night. How I can leave him. Okay, let's not hurt yourself, let's talk with love, he will agree. With love kids can be handle well.  Why are you crying, you have cried all your life, even then your fate has not changed, how this child's fate will change? I have hard luck. Shall I bring something for you to eat? [music]
