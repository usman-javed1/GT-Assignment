[0.04] It's been two hours since Chanda left, she hasn't returned yet and I told you not to let
[7.08] her go alone. Ever since the day Lafda said with all her heart that I will take care of her child,
[12.16] I have lost all control over Lafda, oh her. I recognize the eyes, I
[18.12] count the feathers of a flying bird, and these men are not worthy of trust. I don't know
[23.72] what Amma thinks, sometimes you also talk nonsense. Which one will he
[27.88] take and run away? No, if it was there then it would not have been there and
[32.64] anyway our income is increasing, he will come, why do you burn your blood, why
[37.40] not burn my blood and you yourself had said that Chanda was saying that if it is a girl then she should
[42.68] sacrifice her life. Degi, don't you know, you are making a scene on some road, your dear mother, what kind of
[47.44] things are you talking, don't make any noise, something happens to Chanda, Husna aunty Husna aunty, the nurse says that
[54.68] you will have a son, Dev, we are very happy
[60.04] here to have daughters. Happiness is celebrated,
[64.32] Zeenat, do you know how many prayers I had prayed that the son is going to be the same, Inshallah,
[71.68] you showed me the bag,
[76.56] look at me, I have bought clothes and toys for the son, it is good to see,
[83.48] what is the matter, Husna Bhai, nothing happened to you and me. If there is nothing then
[91.16] be happy in Chanda's happiness, you are there to be happy and if you bring up the child too, then what
[96.64] is the need for me to be happy? Seeing Chanda, you have got the child yourself, I will not give it to you after earning more life,
[103.40] who is yours? What kind of income do you earn? We bring Zeenat and then
[109.20] you earn more. Lesna brother, oh come on, come on, she talks like this, is she jealous
[116.56] of you
[121.12] , isn't there any happiness in my life? If you don't write about your happiness then you yourself would have kicked me.
[125.92] Okay, come on,
[131.16] show me. [Music]
[134.88] Well, becoming a mother is such a big deal, but you don't mind, I will bring
[143.32] everything, and from where will you buy it? You will make our child wear all the old clothes from the market,
[148.52] I will bring new ones. Clothes for your child and what is your father's son, go away, get lost
[155.00] from here, we are leaving, that brother has started getting jealous, you are not me,
[161.12] look at her, look at me, my friend's sister is a very nice girl. She is doing MBA,
[166.96] her name is Anam, so what should I do, do you like me? Now I will talk, I don't want to
[173.28] marry further [music]
[177.76] You are still in love with that Chanda,
[182.52] I am not in love with anyone, just for now I am I don't want to get married, there is no program
[188.04] for me, so the marriage will happen immediately, we will talk now, then I
[192.64] will send you the relationship, then I will acquit you, I said no, I don't want to get married, I am going,
[197.84] okay listen, if you don't like it, I will see someone else.
[202.20] Why don't you get married? What's the matter? If
[207.08] I had to do it then why didn't I do it long ago and why can't I do it now?
[212.72] I will slap you. I know you wouldn't have found anyone willing to marry me.
[219.00] Yes, I haven't found anyone. Then why mention my marriage?
[225.04] Yes, you called my mother. No, I did not call. And please
[232.08] do not try to avoid this matter. Yes, you are talking so nonsense,
[237.20] call her. She has called twice. You have no issue with her, do you?
[241.12] Why are you not calling, this means that today we
[247.72] will talk only on the topic that why I did not call my mother,
[251.72] today we will talk on this topic, okay no problem, next time, but I
[257.12] will definitely talk to you on this topic. Yes Shahram, don't you feel ashamed of talking to me like this?
[263.16] What is there to be ashamed of? I am not proposing you, it is a reality.
[269.08] How long will you
[272.32] keep facing the problems of lonely life? You don't let people like me speak in between. Legally, someone
[277.08] will be your partner. At least he will be able to fight with others for you.
[281.04] You have become very ill-mannered. What is the rudeness in finding a boy for you? You also
[286.52] keep looking for girls for me all the time. Get up, get up, go to Ami. Call me
[292.16] at least uhe tose khon aaye yaar lafde, have I thought of the name of Chanda's son
[298.68] ? [Music]
[303.16] I have thought of hitting the head with stones, I am mad to run, I have named him yes, his
[310.96] name is Shahryar Ali Khan and where is Khan? The name has become 'Se', what is there in 'R', it is a very good name, it has
[318.00] great pride in it, Shahryar Ali Khan, friend of Lafad, friend of Whiskey, it is okay, no friend, thankfully if
[325.60] I had not kept it then the names of my wife's children would have been like this.
[330.80] Look at my name, your mother. You were not named Vard
[336.68] , then what was your name? Do you remember? No, I don't remember. But it
[344.52] was a very good name. What was its name? Oh brother, I remember its mother had named it
[350.36] Iqbal Bala Bala. She used to say o. Bala oh, is this also a name, my dear Bala Gujra
[359.28] ji Ba, it is better than that, it is Dak, my friend, it
[364.72] is such a good name, I get intoxicated after hearing it, isn't it ok sir, I kept it as my name.
[370.88] My remaining issue is that
[375.56] his name will be Shar Ali Khan. Why are you fighting? Ask his mother, she must have given him some name.
[382.24] Hey Amma, we see in dramas that when someone has a child, there
[388.60] is a baby shower. Flowers come, children's clothes are made,
[398.44] nothing like this happens in our country, why doesn't it happen, here we also have dances and songs,
[405.72] I remember very well when you were born, my mother was alive and my younger aunt
[412.72] was also alive. Fruits, flowers, sweets and lots of couplets for you, couplets for me,
[420.08] couplets for Babara and lots of toys. My younger aunt
[428.04] had brought gold anklets for you. Hi, what can I tell you? Amma had bathed you with milk and lots of
[436.16] colorful pictures. Amma Chanda is going to have a son, I am
[442.72] going to celebrate a lot, son, I am feeling happy, Amma is crying, mother
[452.76] is getting ready, oh yes, we will have to give, we will have to give, Puna has also done a lot of giving
[459.88] and heart. Begum
[463.56] was very nice, used in everyone's happiness and sorrow, Amma, then we should do it, oh yes, I will
[471.52] refuse, I am doing it for a while, now you guys go and prepare for the evening, I have gone to
[477.32] pick up the guys, I have broken my back. Now people also have to find and bring
[485.24] the name Shahriyar. I have thought why Shahriyar is Shahram's son or not,
[492.16] the name Shahriyar, which is similar to his name, will look good. Hey Chanda, you have not forgotten him yet,
[499.56] so I cannot forget him throughout my life,
[504.40] can you? You haven't forgotten him, how can you forget?
[510.04] So wife is right, but I am a woman, so you didn't fall in love with him,
[518.04] everyone has love, Chandana, it felt
[522.72] as if you had grabbed my heart with your fist, so I wanted to belong to someone else.
[533.48] No, but soon Amma's abuses took away all the intoxication. Seen, if you too had flown
[540.04] away like me, what would you have done? Fly Chanda, like your Shahram, he also ran away.
[546.40] For some time, I kept crying secretly and all the tears dried up,
[553.44] then I realized that All the feelings of the wife remain dry. I
[561.88] don't want ice to freeze inside me or my tears to dry up.
[566.48] I know that as soon as the child is born, Husna aunty will chase me and people
[573.96] will break down my door
[576.68] . Will you support me? Yes, Chanda, I will be with you. I will give you a promise.
[586.36] I used to think that I am all alone but
[592.36] today I found out that there is one and one is coming. Why are you crying? Keep quiet. I have heard that what
[601.84] a mother does and thinks has an impact on the child. Will you cry? So your
[607.36] child is also crying, get up and keep quiet, I will bring milk for you.
[612.12] Yes, and yes, I have also ordered coconut for you. Heera Bai says that if the mother
[618.92] drinks coconut water, the complexion of the child becomes fair. If you care about it, then the complexion is the same. He
[623.44] is fair, I have brought [Music]
[636.40] Nazar lagi raja tore bangla par nazar lagi raja tore bangla par I would have been king champa
[648.60] Chamelia smell would have been there Raja tore bangla par nazar lagi raja tore bang
[660.60] hi mother how are you Hey Babara Babara come quickly you 10 days She had said, "
[666.20] Where are you coming from after so many days? Hey, after so many days,
[670.60] you have come here. Have you come out? You are sweating in the heat. Why do you guys leave the door open?
[679.28] If you enter, we will not know. Hey, what are we left with?" You sit and come comfortably
[684.96] and everything is fine, the family members were fine.
[690.00] Hey friend, what can I tell you, you all know that I am the eldest among the brothers and sisters.
[695.56] I came here because of the job, I have been sending money to my mother to earn money,
[701.72] I thought of adding something. You must have kept nothing Sachi Champa, raising five children
[710.36] is not an easy task and that too of all the school going brothers,
[718.24] not even the youngest one will be there, what do you work here,
[722.12] they only know that I am a government employee here.
[727.96] I am true Champa, if your mother had not been there, I would not have
[733.56] been able to save so much money and take it away. Listen, you have spent so much money in six months. Oh yes friend, there was a lot of it,
[742.96] I was eating it while sitting, but this is the mind, didn't it come to my mind that I should have got my sister married,
[747.80] I would have come two months earlier, but then Amma became ill, I
[753.32] started serving Amma [music]
[755.16] Then Amma died, I felt very sorry
[762.00] Heema, but I am not sorry, I don't know why like this I used to be afraid that he might
[768.56] come to know what I do here. It is good that I died without knowing anything,
[773.92] it is cruel. Now who will raise your younger brothers and sisters? Hey, they are not even small enough
[780.44] that they have to be raised by the sister. No, the in-laws house of the one I married
[785.48] is in the same house, I have left everyone with him, hey, I have come here from there and you all
[790.24] are talking about the same place, tell me something from here, how are you, where is that aunty Heera?
[798.08] She is a market girl and let me tell you an interesting thing. Yes
[803.44] yes, Chachanda is going to have a child and that too a son.
[812.76] Well, Savitri used to be a very sati and the day before yesterday her lap was full. Okay, leave these
[821.32] things aside, tell me, did you take Chameli with you, where did you leave her, why didn't she come?
[827.72] She had gone with me, but she was with me. I had to go to Sahiwal, I thought she
[833.52] would have reached there, I thought you both ran away and
[839.16] opened a luxurious room far away, come on, stop talking nonsense, you
[845.72] keep talking nonsense all the time, you both are so wretched, I have been here for so long. You guys neither asked for water
[850.48] nor asked for anything to eat. How are you guys? I have forgotten that I had
[855.76] to listen to all the stories from you. Even now you would have brought sherbet. Listen, how are you?
[861.44] Your acting is going well. Just make me a heroine. Make me a heroine, oh oh oh, even if I
[868.36] get married, let it be, oh don't stop, I have
[873.24] been searching for you for so long and you are standing here, oh oh, looking at this, now I feel that he
[880.76] has become one-eyed, oh friend. Come on, it's time for business, it's already evening,
[887.60] we won't even be able to sing, O now there will be no business here, now no one
[891.88] will come here, no one will come here, why won't someone come here, there is going to be a raid here, oh stop joking
[897.88] friend, actually you people who sing You bring it, it doesn't just earn money, it
[904.44] also fills our stomach. Look, if we get the paan made, we will buy gajras, we will earn money,
[913.68] earning is your big earning, don't worry, if you do this for 25 gajras, you will spend 25 pounds.
[921.12] How much money will that be? I swear by Allah and you will give the money for it, I will give it
[928.00] from my bag.
[931.08] O I understand, I have got a very big person. Please change my mood. Oye, let's go, Chanda's
[939.04] baby shower is about to happen today. There is no customer today. Oye, you are telling the truth,
[946.16] you are paying for the flowers and paan. I am swearing on Allah from now on, I will give you food as well,
[950.72] but the flowers are from me and I will not even take money for the gajra. Okay. So
[956.28] then food is from you and drink is from me. Say hi hi hi hi my love, I
