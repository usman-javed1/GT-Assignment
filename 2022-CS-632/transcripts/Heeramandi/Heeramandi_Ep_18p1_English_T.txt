[5.64] him. I have already apologised, now leave me. Auntie
[15.24] forgive me too, I made a mistake
[21.92] I should have not misbehaved with Rani. My dear, that's why they say think before speaking,

[65.44] Are you crazy? Earlier I had a little doubt that you are mad, now I am sure
[72.56] that you are  mad. Hey Lafrah, you are absolutely right, I have gone mad, luck has
[76.84] suddenly been kind to me, I will play with money, what is going to happen, it should happen once,
[82.12] I am going. Hey, you have been dreaming all your life.
[93.20] He is talking big things, saying that I will bring customers for you from abroad.
[98.56] Hey, you leave him, he talks big things and these days,
[104.08] he is asking Chanda and me to leave this place and shift in 
[109.32] bungalow, now you tell me, does anyone leave his old place? If the new place is good, then one
[115.32] should leave the old place, one should bring changes in life t gain progresses in life. Now 
[121.60] will shift in bungalow. New customer, glamour in life, you will get a new car, I
[128.64] mean ....Serve me tea.
[132.12] I know, you are not going to go without drinking the tea. By the way, Hema Bai you are looking very good,
[140.64] Lafray, you are still lascivious. I am a man and man is always a lascivious ,
[148.32] I am bringing you, have patience. By the way,  you still look young.
[156.04]  
[160.92] How is this looking? Very nice. Let me do this straight.
[168.68] Wow Rani, you have good make up skills. Zarka is looking pretty. 
[175.56] It's not my skill. Zarka is already very pretty. Then let's compete with Zarka today.
[181.60] Mother and Zarka, think that I only know English dance but
[186.80] I can also show them what I know and you know on which song I
[191.96] will dance? Which one? Okay, I will also
[200.04] dance on this song and will beat you. It is going to be a lot of fun while dancing,
[206.04] Okay then let's do it! Okay!
[218.48] Hey Chanda, today I will make Punjabi cuisine
[224.24] Mother, I have bought a unique customer, which you never thought about. 
[229.00] Guddu .... Come Madam
[237.12] Asalam alikum. Walikum aslam. Mother, she wants a girl. Guddu, you are crazy.
[246.68] Is this a customer? She wants a girl? Madam, I had told you that in our
[253.48] place girls only dance and sing. Yes, but I don't want to make them dance and sing. I
[258.76] told you that. I know Madam. Pari, Zarka, Rani ... Come out
[265.24] Guddu, you are in your senses? You know that we do not sell girls. I will tell you everything,
[273.00] Quickly, come here, Madam, you can select from them
[277.95] [music]
[290.20] What is your name?
[297.72] Zarka!
[302.16] Guddu, tell me clearly what is going on? Mother, I will explain everything,
[307.96] you go inside, go to Mother's room, go,
[313.28] Go now.
[324.00] What has happened to the whiskey?
[332.04] Hey, in today's times, anything goes. How she was asking my name? What is your name?
[337.84] And you said in style ... Zarka
[343.84] Keep quite. Now you are gone. By the way she was looking very weird,
[350.36] I don't know, Whisky will tell. Let Whisky come, then I will ask him
[356.00] I know that you people do not sell you daughters, that is why I have come here. Sorry Madam, I forgot,
[365.52] you sit, then we will discuss. Please sit. Mother, you also sit
[374.32]  What I am trying to tell you
[382.48] has nothing to do with what you are thinking. Please forgive me Madam but,
[388.68] the person who comes here is concerned with only one thing, whether you hold the ear from here or from there
[394.40] the matter remains the same. 
[398.20] I belong to a noble family. All the people who come here call themselves
[405.80] from a noble family. What are you doing Mother? She is not an ordinary lady,
[410.28] she is a very big lady, please listen to her first. Please continue
[417.20] I have come here due to compulsion.
[423.60] Okay, tell me. I am listening
[429.00] I want a child and
[434.64] I want to take one girl from you.
[443.20] What are you saying? Do you understand the meaning of this? The same
[449.92] bad deed, we don't like. Mother, you sit and listen to the whole thing.
[456.12] No bad deed, I will get the girl I like married properly.
[463.92] Jewellery, clothes, everything will be there till the child is born 
[472.12] she will be our responsibility but after the child is born, we will divorce her and we will take the child and
[480.24] go away from here. And what will you tell people that the child is
[485.64] born in your house?
[488.16] Yes. Why don't you adopt someone else's child?
[493.40] We wanted to adopt someone else's child, but I just didn't feel
[502.04] like it. A person wants
[507.00] his own child to raise.
[510.36] I think your husband tried to amuse you. But actually he
[515.48] want to marry again.
[523.64] Whatever, if you all agree, then I am ready to give up to Rs 5 lakh for this work,
[532.60] the expenses, jewellery, are all apart from this, there will be nothing that is illegitimate.  The work
[539.60] will be done in the right way,
[542.92] But the girl you have liked is my son's ... She is the daughter of our Hema Khala,
[550.76] I will get you to talk to her, don't worry, I will convince her that it will be done, you go
[556.28] Madam, after doing everything, I will call you. Guddu? Mother, Madam is getting late.
[561.76] We will talk later.
[566.96] I am taking with me the belief that you all will understand my helplessness.
[572.88] I will be waiting for your reply. Whoever the girl belongs to, if you wish, you can convince her.
[579.52] Yes Madam, I am saying, I am here, everything will be done, you just relax.
[587.20] I can even give 10 lakhs for this work,
[593.24] Madam, your work is done. Guddu, listen to me.
[600.34] He has gone crazy.
[608.24] 10 lakhs! Jewellery and clothes apart, you can also get 5 lakhs as dowry too.
[615.56] Don't talk nonsense, Whiskey, don't you feel ashamed while talking about me
[621.12] For your fiance? Hey, how did you even think like this? Should I sell the girl? Hey
[627.92] Auntie, this is not selling. This is selling. You are selling me for clothes, Jewellery  and Rs10 lakhs.
[634.52] Mother, I am ready for marriage, he is getting married,
[642.00] and divorce is not a big deal? This happens to girls all the time. You stupid girl
[647.68]  he is getting married, he will not make a wife, and when he has a child, he will keep her too
[652.72] and will kick you out. Hey Whiskey, I am asking how did you even think like this. 
[658.80] We don't want this type of money. Auntie, I swear our days will be filled with money,
[664.16] don't you know? I keep driving rickshaw all day in the sun. Look for customers daily,
[669.56] and they give Rs 50,100 or 200
[672.40]  Neither you people can survive on this nor we. How is our situation will cahnge Aunty , tell me,
[679.28] You will change the situation by selling me? It's not selling, you will get married. Then
[685.84] there will be a divorce, you will marry a divorce girl?
[691.82] [Music]
[697.91] [Music]
[715.72] Allah is merciful.
[721.28] people who don't need, they are blessed with many children and those to whom he has given so much wealth
[728.48] depriving for child. What would happened if this woman also gets child?
[735.52] It is a game of nature, only God knows better. Here, no one gets what he
[744.60] wants . And God gives everything to those who don't want it.
[750.56] Now see,
[754.28] here we manage money to feed the girls,
[760.76] on the other hand Madam, no one in her house
[764.52] will even know how much wealth they have.
[768.60] I am angry with Guddu. How did he bring that woman here? Why didn't he refuse
[775.04] her? How he can be so mean?
[780.20] And look at that woman, she select only our Zarka
[786.44] Tell me one thing Chanda, Do you think Hema will agree?
[795.64] I don't know what she is thinking. But If she agrees, she
[802.40] will make a big mistake and will regret it later.
[807.01] [Music]
[818.72] Rani, do you know what my heart says?
[822.72] My heart says that if there is one sensible person in the whole place, is only you 
[827.44] You will do my work?
[831.36] Try to convince Zarka, You know I
[838.64] will not marry her and that bitch is refusing only because she
[842.48] thinks of me as her fiance. Why are you talking so mean? You had persuaded me
[848.20] that you are her fiance and you love her. Hey, I had said this
[853.48]  to save my life, you know, the day before yesterday when I went to Madam's house and she
[859.24] had told me the whole thing about what she want, since then I was thinking that how will I convince her
[863.04] And this was the only way to convince her and see how ungrateful she is , I am explaining that
[870.08] no one can earn this amount by staying here as she is getting with this work,
[873.40] everyone will be blessed. You are sensible, you try to explain
[878.76] her. No whisky, I don't think that she will agree
[886.12] But you can talk to Lafrah, if he convinced Hema Auntie, then Zarka will agree.
[892.48] You are absolutely right. I said the only intelligent person in this whole place is you.
[898.16] I am going to talk to Lafrah. Lafda will go and talk to auntie.
[901.44] And listen, if she disagree with Lafrah, then you will talk for me. Yes,
[908.84] okay, I will talk.
[916.61] [Music]
[923.28] Think sensibly. Let me tell you one thing clearly,
[929.48] Guddu will never marry your daughter. This is such a big offer. You will never get this
[936.72] again in life. You will marry one daughter and the other's dowry will be ready.
[943.68] How can you talk like this? Hey, he will divorce her and take the child. Hey,
[951.40] does any woman ever sell her child? Who knows whether she will give birth or
[958.28] not? Courtesan never sold her child. All the
[962.08] illegal babies belong them. This child is not  illegal and as far as divorce is concerned
[969.28] Girl should have this much strength that she keeps him in control, if she takes good care of him 
[975.12] he will never leave her. You have two daughters, you have fed your sisters and brothers all your life.
[981.96] Now you are raising girls, you will do this all your life? You can't save money
[987.48] remember one thing, no one will give name to your daughters
[996.48] You are right, but this .... It would not be wrong to do this.
[1007.20] Why did Zeenat die from AIDS? Because the marriage took place very late, the marriage
[1012.76] was done earlier, she could never get AIDS. And the last thing if you want to agree
[1018.44] otherwise I will consider that I have fulfilled my duty. Thing is
[1024.60] after sometimes your girls will be fed up with this all and they start prostitution. Then
[1028.80] don't tell me
[1031.96] You are right, but I can't talk to Zarka, someone else should talk to her. You talk to her.
[1040.44] If she agrees, then okay I am agree. Okay, I will talk to her.
[1048.16] where is she? She went to market. Okay
[1056.12] Thank God, you got my point.
