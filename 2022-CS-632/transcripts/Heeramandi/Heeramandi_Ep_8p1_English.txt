Don't call me, I will tell him that he will find Vatka and bring him back. He is searching for him. Hey, go to Mansi and tell him, Guddu must be hungry. Please bring him. When you see him keep crying, why don't you give him opium and put him to sleep? I swear, Amma. She used to do the same with me and you are loving her dirty. The doctor has not forbidden you. A No, he has not forbidden me for anything. She cuts the hair. Listen, Chanda. I have called Shah Saab's car to come. The one who is going to ask everyone will be the one who refused.
