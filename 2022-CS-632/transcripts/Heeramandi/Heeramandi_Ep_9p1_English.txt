Don't teach me fun, alive, you change my name, she has come out of the mouth, oh Allah, what have you done, you did not know that she has changed here, hey, he will make our life a torture, what will that false accusation do? I think he will lock me up in the police station, no, I will not let you people be locked up, I will not let you guys be locked up, what do you think, we will let you all locked up, you would have mouthed off, why was there a need to raise your hand, you don't know that you were burnt earlier. Aunty, I am not afraid of anyone and tell him that I will give up my life which is beyond his reach and will not let his wishes be fulfilled. I had come with a donation to fulfill his wishes. You yourself have spoiled the work. Amma had told him that your I am not well, yes, so what else did I tell her, Chanda has given birth to a child, she has undergone a major operation, she got 18 stitches, oh Chanda, what else happened, the police station came, yes, and Chanda slapped her, he is very angry, now I know. No, what else will he do, what will he do to save Dudu, what will he do, will he put us all inside, what else will he do? O she is blind, brother, you are amazing, you are a small one, there are many people on top of her, and I knew that one day he will come all. I have made arrangements , I have heard the name of Seth Imtiyaz, he is his nephew, he is the DSP, I will see, I will see him, you will see, then go, then you keep quiet, you will search for Imtiyaz Dilli and his nephew, and he is a SHO, he will do his work and go away. Okay, you guys are scared, okay, I'll take Chanda and the child, don't worry, go out, now don't chatter, there is no need to let anyone go, let's see what happens, we will all suffer, I will dance, I will dance, I will sing hum. Saiya more, come, I will sing to them, I will sing, I will dance, I will sing, I will sing, I will turn, what is the matter, today Champa is shining very brightly and you must be jealous after seeing me, why would I go, I have never seen you without getting ready, you look like a witch, you are my witch. Have you come here to have fun, not to have fun? You have come for work. Tell me the work and get out of here. This is my place. Brother, I can come here whenever I want and I can sit here. Oye, don't let the pressure of space bother you. This is my place. Hey you. So keep quiet, tell me what is the matter, aunty, give me my embroidery, why will he do it? Just a few months ago, you took all the money from me, spent it all, you even saved some, hey, Amma, he had gone there to see Zeenat's dance. He has squandered all the money. Oh he has gone mad. I have never seen Zeenat's dance before. He squandered all the money, I don't want it now, I don't want to stop depositing it and then I can do whatever I want with you, from where did you get it from me, Guddu. Had to buy things for Guddu? Hey, have you gone mad? I had brought so many things for Guddu and those things, those two rings and two pairs of things. I have seen a car for him. Is he giving it to him with a pizza? Don't be kidding. Nah, for him, it is not the vehicle in which the child learns to walk. What do they call it as a walker, oh fool, oh fool, they call it a walker, not a walker, oh oh friend, and it is not as good for a small child as it is for Guddu when he grows up. He will start walking, bring him, oh when he grows up, take him, friend, from now on he will learn, then he will learn to walk, then he will learn to run, then he will learn to commit every sin, friend, and I have not come to seek advice from you guys, I want it before me, I just said it. Vatka, I don't have money, these little devotees have thrown Hema Malani out of here, she used to give me a good commission, they just fired Hema and where she has gone, who knows that she has settled in the heart of Husna Aunty. What else can you do? And hey man, you just shut up, you have already caused harm to me, it is being said from above, friend, you all pamper me later, first give me my money, I told you that I don't have money, ok then 000 Just give it, oh oh Kambak, I have fallen behind, even if we die of hunger, you take Rs. 000. Don't you know aunty, how much fun it is to give. Go away witch, we will not leave you . You are in the juice of this world like high walls. Nothing is in your control Zeenat, nothing is in my control, what should my heart do when someone falls in love with someone, I don't know when or where, she hasn't come for samosas, hasn't she gone to buy vegetables and you know, when she buys vegetables, she fights for an hour first. And then she reduces the money and then comes with the vegetables. Guddu is asleep, isn't he? Where will I feed him first? Then put him to sleep. Come on, hey, have you brought food already? I haven't come with any food, he is crying, do you have any work? I was just asking, have you gone to the market, do you have any work? I wanted to talk to you [music] What should I talk about? Hey, tell me, what do you want to talk about ? Look, don't talk bluntly to me, and let me tell you one more thing. It would be very bad not to disappear again like the first time. Understand with you, now tell me, I brought this [praise] for you [praise], brought it for me, why is it not good [music] I liked it [praise], I love you a lot, don't you [music ] ] Be innocent of me, wear this locket, I am mine, so what else is your father making? Now don't open it [praise] Just remove your hair [music] [praise] [music] and that too in reverse [praise] [music] [praise] Panaya ji Amma, everything is fine and please tell Baba that your son, whom he considered useless and stupid, has started a big business. I am going to London. Son, whatever he says is for your good. It would have been nice if you had done so much of what you are doing today in front of him. If he had allowed me to do something, he would have looked at me, then I would have done something. Tell me, Zaira is gone, Amma, I told you that she left from here. Amma, why don't you believe me? Tell me the truth. Amma, she has gone from here. She is gone. Amma, well, if you are going to London, then put the house on rent. Amma, what are you talking about ? How can I give the house on rent, so many paintings of Abba, so many statues, I don't know from where he collected everything, anyone else can spoil it, I can't pay the rent and yes, I will lock the house and go to London. I will give you my number, you will call me on that [Music] Ok, you lied, for how long, how long will you keep lying for me? What else would you have done if you had not lied, Baral [Music] Now Amma will not call here [Music] Now if she is yours If she doesn't want to live with me, should I forcefully send her away? Look at her, Husna, you are not playing any trick with me, why do I need to play tricks and it was not I who started this fight, you forbade your girls, you beat that poor girl so much. Ko and you know how helpless Hema is. Oh okay, I know how helpless Hima is, but where are there no fights? Sorry Heera, there is a big difference between fighting and fighting, see, we commit crimes all our life. Sometimes one should do good deeds, isn't it okay, you supported Hema of good deeds, now if she has left you and has come to me, should I forcefully throw her out? Now do you consider her clever or something else, it is your choice, I will tell you this. She had come to say that you understood Hema, now those two girls will not do anything to her. Hey Hema, stop, son, stop, stop, my child, stop and listen to me. Hey, listen, child, I have come to take you, listen to me. Whatever they did to you, I apologize on behalf of both of them. Please forgive me. You have always called me your mother. Now consider me as your mother and accept my words. No, Heera Aunty, I do not want to go there with you. So I can't even think of going, after all I also have some respect, whatever I do, I am doing it to feed my sisters and brothers, not to get myself insulted and in front of you Champa and Babra. What has she done to me? Hey, I know my child. Okay, don't be angry. This is how I do it. I would have called her here and made her apologize to you. Hey, leave it aunty. I don't want to see her face. Hey, listen to me. What kind of unbridled mare you are. This is gone [Music] [Music] Hey Guddu, why is Aunty crying, Amma saying, will he come here or go to her, there is no need to go, I refused, only this doctor will come, he will sit at 6:00, 8:00 I will get up at 10 o'clock, you are coming with me, listen Chanda, I am coming with you, I am getting bored of sitting at home, so let me get some outside air also. Yes, it is fine, both of you go together, but see, come early. Yes, aunty is just coming and going. It takes time for the vaccine, it's a matter of five minutes, you just sit here, I have changed my clothes, let's go, okay, hurry up, Amma, by the way, I don't know what time brother will come, if Vat's wife is with you, leave Vat's wife, she is just Heera Bai. For this, I am just telling you that Taka and Lafda have gone together, we will see when we come, in this time you make tea for me, I am having a headache [Music] Amma, you are worried about her all the time, just forget it. Go and forget him, thinking that he said, ' Come and go. ' I wanted to find her, at least I can tell her that she has a son. Hey friend, I know if I still meet her then I will tell her that even if she doesn't take me, take Guddu, Hema. I don't want Guddu to grow up in Tawaf. I want him to grow up in a good family, get educated and become a good man like his father, don't worry about Guddu, Guddu is still very small, for two to four years, he will not even know where he is growing up and with whom he is growing up. Is he blind? Whom did he tell you? Hey, what are you doing? Leave him, what are you doing? Hey, alive, alive, someone save me. Slowly, slowly, the heart of the alive, the helpless bed of the life, becomes love as it grows. Oh this flower, oh oh where. Phoolan, look under these flowers and leaves, Baba Chhota ji, come friend, he is not here, friend, do not steal the clothes from here, oh you have gone mad, this is not your father's property, oh friend, do not take father's name, I don't know where he will be alive. Come and die, your father might be alive too, otherwise there is no use for you, he is dead for you, oh friend, what happened to this lafra and gone friend, oh oh ba ke oh oh, it has become a chava and I am now, the shop is closed. I will do it here, my Maula, what happened while sitting, oh Champa, oh Babra, hey Kambak, open the door, come out, what is it, Amma, I am putting in overtime in the evening, what is your problem, oh Chachanda is gone. Amma , what are you saying ? Hey, I had gone with Hema, someone has raped me, Amma, she must be lying, Hema is the liar of the whole world, whatever, just throw these people out, and you all go, I will bring the medicine and come back. I am Babra, you go, I am okay, oh Husna Bhai, don't worry, I will bring him, he is Imtiaz Ali Khan, his nephew is DSP, I swear to God, you did not remove his belt, you are not your father's, I am not yours, oh friend, I am also yours. Two policemen will come with me, I am also a customer, you have lost your mind Lafde, first go and get a police report done, without the report your DSP cannot do anything, how will he find Chanda, yes Lafde, if Chanda would have been picked up by the police station. Neither will he be in the police station. Hey, who will take care of the child? How will we take care of the child? How will that poor girl be suffering without her child? By the way, if something happens to Chada, Husna brother, then why do I have to stay alive? Just don't worry, I I will bring him, come on, come on, friend.
