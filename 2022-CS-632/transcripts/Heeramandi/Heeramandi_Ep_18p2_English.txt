[Music]  How are you Zarka? I am fine. Where is Hema Auntie? Where she has gone? She has gone to the market, Pari had to buy some things. Sit down, Zarka, I want to talk to you, What you want to talk? Do you remember, that a woman came to our place? The one who liked you and while leaving she had said that she will give Rs10 lakhs, if you follow my advice then don't refuse  What? Say yes to her. You bastard, you want to sell me to clear your way, I will beat you. Hey, you said the same nonsense again, hey, how did you touch her? Tell me one thing, what do you think, I will marry you, who is the child of a courtesan, who is not even sure about her father. The one who dances on the brothel and goes to people's houses. Whiskey, don't talk nonsense, you too are not the child of any noble person, you are the child of courtesan. I am a man  and man can do everything, A man can do everything. Whatever is sin for me is a sin for you also. Don't you feel ashamed that your fiancee .... Keep quiet, Stop calling yourself my fiancee, Who said that you are my fiancee? I never accepted you as my fiancee and Listen one thing, you will come back even after dying 10 times, even then I will not marry you. Hey, I don't know what you do in people's houses. Whisky! Let's go ... [music] [music] [music] Madam, that girl is not ready but don't worry, you select some other girl and there were two more girls, Rani and Pari. Look, this is a matter of our next generation. I am not buying that girl, I am getting her married, I am getting her married properly. She will live with us in this house for one year. I swear Madam  there is nothing wrong with both of girls, they are good looking and even well behaved you once Look at them again. But why this girl is not agreeing? Is it a matter of money? If it is such a thing, then let's decide. No Madam, money is good you leave her, she is unlucky. She is not agreeing You can go there with me whenever you want, choose anyone you like Today? Whenever you want. You will have to wait a little,  I am waiting, Madam You want tea or juice? ... Juice! Oh Allah, make any girl agree. Aameen  10 Lakh is a big amount. Look at mother, she have spent her whole life but till date she have not been able to earn that much money and then the jewellery, you know the gold prices are too high. Poor Mother has been thinking for a long time to buy small jewellery set but still unable to make it and may God bless Vodka, he died otherwise we had to pay the rent of this place too. If you will agree then all our sorrows and pains will go away and then we have never seen this much money before If you don't want to get married, then it's okay, I tell mother that I am ready, I will get money and I will have fun too. And it's not a big deal to control a man, I will control him the way not only divorce, he will forget his wife too. If Rani agrees then all the fun and all the money will go there and I will tell Whiskey that I am ready for this marriage. If we cannot do anything else for mother, the least we can do is to buy peace for her till her death. Poor mother has spent her whole life in sorrow because of us. She is so troubled. Now mother is unwell too. My only wish is to see mother Happy [Music]  Last time too, after seeing you, I felt as if I have seen you somewhere, Madam, women like us roam around from place to place, you must have seen me anywhere. See, any girl agree,  it doesn't matter to me, the real thing is that your girls are decent, I mean they have no relation with such people, otherwise there are thousands of girls available in this money. But the point is that who knows how they have relations with whom. Our compulsion is a child If you have children, then it is a problem, if not, then also a problem. But I cannot help you in this regard, Mother, please convince Rani, talk to Neelam Aunty, I swear, the days will change, No. You know I don't involve myself in such things and then why should I take someone else's crime upon myself? Talk yourself, Rani, if you agree to Madam  No Whiskey, you know I don't do this work and If we wanted to earn money this way, we could have done dirty business also. They are all unlucky. They don't want to change their circumstances. They are kicking the wealth If you talk, try to convince the girl, No, I can't do this First of all, Rani is not my daughter, I can't force her, her mother has gone out, she must be coming, if you want, then wait for her. If my work here is not done then I will regret a lot, I came here under great compulsion, I realized for the first time that what can a person do under compulsion Madam,  I am ready... Zarka?  It's good that she agreed to the marriage, otherwise I had thought, that if she doesn't agree then I will get married. Mother, now you talk to Madam to give us half the amount in advance, after all we have to prepare for the marriage. What are you thinking mother? Mother call Whiskey and take Madam's number from her and talk to her right now. Hey, you shut up, you are worried about your money and things, I am worried about my daughter, what will happen to her [Music] [Music] It's my son, you Why did you take this decision [laughter] Because no one here needs me, no one realizes me, it doesn't matter to anyone whether I stay, go away, get sold or die , why did you guys get me engaged to my son Zeenat? Why did you let me do this, Amma? How did I know that Whiskey would do all this? Vicky is a small human being, Amma, he knows how to sell, Amma, he only cares about the fat Assamese, rather than living here and complaining, it is better that I get married, I am like this. Amma , I will be of use to you people, Amma, you will have enough money to get married in a good place, now you can spend the rest of your life comfortably, Amma, because of me, a destitute woman will get a child, I will get her blessings. Amma Amma, I will be found, so what if I couldn't do anything for myself , at least do something for others [Music] [Praise] [Music] Jangi ri don't worry [Music] Don't worry about me, I will be happy [ Music]  No Neelam, you know I don't like such things, then what right do I have to explain or convince Rani? I was very happy when she herself refused in front of Madam. She couldn't agree. If we want money to be earned like this, we would have earned it long ago. Do you know that I had a loan of 80 thousand, a year ago, how I paid it, I know or my  God knows, but tell me one thing. How did this Zarka agree? It's her compulsion She loves Guddu and wants to marry him but Guddu doesn't agree. Now what else that poor girl will do? Listen, did you talked to Hema? What is the benefit? That girl's heart is broken, Chanda, I am going to see the boy for Zarka tomorrow, you will go with me? You know that I don't go any where   If you want, you can take Neelam. You will go yourself or someone will pick you? No, I will go with Whiskey, you will go with me? Yes, okay. I will go with you [Music]  Zarka If mother tells that he is 50 years old, then what will happen? If he is 100 years old, I will still marry him, now I will curse Whisky, What he think about himself? Is he big boss? Or a child of a noble family or is he Prince Gulfam? When your own people starts taunting  about being a courtesan, then what is the use of decency? He is crazy, by the way, let me tell you one thing, you thought that he will marry you, he has no interest in you. I have understood it well and now I have also taken an oath that I will never even talk to him. Okay, let's not take useless oath. Mother is here. What kind of people are they? They are very nice people, Pari. Very nice and Zarka Saraka, I liked everyone very much, they are decent people. Mother, The boy is 50 years old? Come on, the boy is also very nice and do you know what madam said? She said that if Zarka wants to meet him then bring her here. Why can't he come here, is there mehendi on his feet? If he can't so what? If Zarka wants to see him, I don't want to see, get me married and settle me down [Music]
