[Music] Mother, I am a worm of filth and disgrace I have no right to live, why you give birth to me? If by mistake I was born, why didn't you kill me soon after the birth. No my child You should have thrown me in the garbage, I would have been taken away by stray dogs I wouldn’t have been called bastard I am your culprit I lied to Shehram  he asked me, so I told him you are a sex worker I lied that you are a sex worker Guddu Guddu [Music] Chanda .... [Music] I want to talk to you after me  How did you spend your life?   With the .... With the support of your son [Music]  What did you say? My son? Yes! I could not get anything else in that one night, but I definitely became the mother of your child, perhaps God knew that in the coming moments, I would not be able to bear being alone, that is why he What are you saying Chanda? Is this true? I wish it was a lie I wish the pain of that night had not made me mother. I would have left this world. At least I would not have to face the pain of illegal child A child who doesn't get his father's name so he doesn't accept his own name. Where is my son? What will you do after meeting him? A child born in such an environment can only be called Dirth he blamed me for keeping him alive He is saying right. Why did I give birth to him? Why didn't I kill him as soon as he was born? Why didn't I leave him in the garbage heap for dogs to eat? What kind of things are you talking about? I will give him my name after all he is my son. Chanda, forgive me, I thought that you ... please forgive me  You come with me, to my house No, courtesan has no home, the four walls in which they spend their life, people don't call it a home, it is called a brothel or roadside A place where people don’t care who they hurt as they go You will not stay here anymore; you will come with me to my house you will stay with me, we both will love our son, the love of parents! I can't go with you. Sir ... she will go with you, I am guilty, it is my fault I am your culprit, I have lied to you, I have lied, that she is a sex worker she is not a sex worker, she is innocent and Whisky  Guddu is your son [Music]  Whisky? Yes! .... My son? Yes sir, he is your son [Music]  Where is he? Call him. Sir, I don't know where he has gone. I will bring him to you. You take her sir, I will bring Guddu to your house, I promise!   Take her with you. I will not go anywhere, Why won't you go? All life you have been waiting for him She has been waiting for you all her life. Now when he is here then what happened to you? I will not go anywhere without Guddu, Guddu hasn’t gone anywhere. I will  bring him back to you. Chande, go with him, there is nothing for you here. Everything is over. It's the end of the story. Take her with you Sir. I beg in front of you, take her. Hey crazy, just go! Go from here. Everything is over Chande! [Music] [Music] [Music] Shehram, where were you? I have been calling you for so long, your phone was also switched off, I She was worried. Come Chanda. [Music] She will stay here from today onwards [Music] Mother ... Mother ... Mother ... Mother ... Mother ... Mother ... Mother ... Mother ... Mother ... Mother ...   Mother ... Who are you looking for Whiskey? Looking for your mother? She used to give decency lectures; she went with a man just a while ago she has found someone who will pay her price You tell lies, she was my mother, not a traitor.   Your mother, she was also a courtesan, today she finally went with a customer You are lying. Leave me  If I am lying, then go and ask father of yours, Lafra Lafrah ... Lafray ... Zaira .... Just open the door. I want to talk to you Zaira please, open the door let me talk to you The woman I have brought home is not the courtesan with whom I spent the night. I have brought that Chanda who is the mother of my son! and that child is not dead like Murad's child he is alive. He was punished for my crimes and spent so many years living on a pile of filth   Apparently, there is no fault of that child. I told you that a thorn hurts in my heart, maybe that was not my sub conscience, it was the pain that God had created to give me this feeling. I did not know that even a little mistake of mine would give birth to this incident no decent man who wants to entertain his heart, goes to the brothel is unaware of the fact what he is going to lose, and when he comes out after seducing a woman, he still does not know that he has lost everything It's been years So many years have passed and now I know That boy spent every moment of these years in misery. He kept considering himself a worm in a dirty drain and an illegitimate child, whereas he is not an illegitimate child, I am his illegitimate father. I am the one who should have endured the tortures, but that poor child endured.  You know who he is? You don't know. If you know, then maybe you will blame me more than that child and Chanda. How many times did that child come in front of me and I could not recognize him, He through my decency in my face and I could not recognize him that he is my son, my own child! The blood of this noble family. The same blood that is running in my veins, is running in his veins also, would you like to know who is he? Whisky! Whiskey, is my son. [Music] [Song] [Song] Hey, a dead body! I think he is dead. [Music] [Music] [Music] Where were you all night? I have been waiting for you all night, I’ve been restless. Why are you not answering? Where were you? I took many wrong decisions in my life one of them was to marry Zarka on your insistence, but now I do not want to take any wrong decision, infact I want to correct my decisions, so, I have   got divorce papers ready!  [Music] I have come to know right and wrong so, I have decided that you will get the divorce papers tomorrow, I can't live with you. What are you saying? This is a home for both of us Neither of us will leave from here.   Thank you!
