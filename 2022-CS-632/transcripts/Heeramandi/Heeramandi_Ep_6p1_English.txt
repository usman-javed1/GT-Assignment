I haven't even gone towards him, I think he might have got upset but he has been harassing me the whole night. What a strange thing has happened, o Namaz again and again, I couldn't even get up due to embarrassment. Oh Zeenat's. He must have been praying for the blessing and still he kept running up, I made loud noises, he did not stop, oh what is this, oh, there is no donation, yes, I had brought it for him, yes, and everything went wrong, how is it at night, oh wow brother. Wow Allah give me life, what a lovely child , he is very cute, Japanese, come, Paan Paan Lo, Paan La Bacha Paan Lo, Ji La, how he is looking, he is very beautiful, just like you, you have touched him, he has become exactly like you, may God make him pure, just like me. Well, it's good that I am a beautiful person, he is like his father, by the way, you have done well by finding the medicine for my loneliness, that is why I have brought it so that you can keep looking at it all day, then our child will be just as beautiful, our child is not crazy. Gaya, this is Shahram's child, so come on, the father is the one who raises the child, not the one who runs away. Yes, I will get him, I am his father, see, you will get his face too, Inshallah, he gets the hat from me, see. Is she like me or not? Our factory will export garments to them for the whole season. Yes, this is a big news. Abba Jaan used to say that I cannot do any work. If I join their factory, I will bankrupt them. Now let my first shipment go. Just call them and tell them, ok, I will tell them and you have to pray with me that I get two or four more shipments like this. I am just happy, okay, one more, oh what is this rudeness, so you tell me what rudeness is this. It is rather bullying Rehan, you listen to me, don't say anything, now the whole neighborhood tells the stories of your decency and that's what I came to see, who am I, why does he come here, you don't know who I am, I am just a person. I know that you have nothing to do with them, and you should not talk to them, control your tongue, otherwise what will you do, Rihan, leave her, why do you have the courage, forget about coming to this house, this is not your father's house, this is mine. This is father's house And if I step into this house in the future, I will hand him over to the police. Go, go, call the police. He laughs and hand me over to me. He threatens me after seeing a single woman. Shehram is yours, it is for Allah's sake, you are for God's sake, Shahram, please go. You leave me from here, I see you, what do you do, for God's sake, you go from here, you leave me, I will see me, S. Sheram, for God's sake, who are you to fight for me, go, otherwise go from here [ Music] I don't know what he thinks of himself [Music] Look, he loves me like a sister, you know me, I have been living in his house for eight years, he is like a younger brother, just let me live, I know I am one of these younger Brothers, if you ever step out of the house, see what kind of story is being spread about you. Thankfully, my brother is not alive. Kapka would have died after seeing your actions, Rehan. Why are you blaming me? I don't need you. No, the people of your locality are enough to accuse you and I know one thing that we should not be defamed because of you. Sign this paper and leave this house. The person because of whom you are being so arrogant should not let him down. I will shoot so many bullets that you won't even know why you would shoot him. It is because of him that you have got so much courage. I will come back after an hour. Papers should be signed [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] By the way This Zeenat has gone alone, no, tests were to be done, well, her aunt and father also went along, I don't know what happened to her, her face got discolored, what is to be expected, she might have got malaria and what else might have happened, listen to her, take care of yourself, darling. I think that when I have a child, he will come to know that he is the son of Tawaf, what will he think, I don't want him to ever know, I want him to study and enroll him in an English school. Never know that he was born in a brothel. I don't even want him to stay here. There is no such place where I can go before the child is born. Janam, what kind of things do you talk, Chanda, the lava of this place is the place. If we have someone born then he will have to stay here only Chanda ji, for two to four years it is not possible for him to know where he was born and with whom he is being brought up and later on he will send him to school, there is no problem, if you listen to me then he should stay here. Only Pal will study and I will send him to school, don't worry about it, it's too late Zeenat and the rest did not know anything, hey, I 'll come back from the dispensary , ba, listen, give a gift to Ma, yes, give a gift to someone, but take care of yourself. I just left, just came [Music] [Praise] [Music] Why did you do it Sai? What did you do? How long did you have to bear the burden every day? You also had a right on that house. You should have fought for your rights. I can't fight the case. Had I done so, who would have gone to the court ? You had no faith in me. I would have supported you, I would have gone to the court. And I had told you to let me talk to Salman uncle. You did not even agree to that, there was no use Shahram, there was no use, leave me. No one ever gives anything to people like you, always snatches it, I had no place after leaving there, Shahram, that's why I have come here, come inside, sit and talk [music], I will not bother you much, I will just find one day. Why are you talking about some place, why there will be no room for you in such a big house, or this is the same house where you used to live, but if you stay here then I will consider my house more like yours, you don't know how worried I was for you, but seeing you. I feel as if blood relation is not a big thing, the relation between sorrow and happiness is the biggest. I was also coming to your house, I am sorry, I scolded you, come and sit inside, I am not sad about that, I regret only one thing. You told me not to talk to Rihaan, you don't know him, Shahram, he is an ill-mannered man, you should have allowed a fight with him, I am not afraid of him, it is only because of you that I have left him, otherwise he would have misbehaved. Well , whatever had to happen has happened, now you forget everything, there is no need to go anywhere, you just stay here, he is not so important that he can come here, he has no trust, Shahram, just don't mess with me. Now even I am not in trouble. Yes, if he tries to misbehave with me, I will not leave him.
