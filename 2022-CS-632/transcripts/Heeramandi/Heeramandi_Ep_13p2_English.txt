No dear, I just had the halwa puri. Shall I tell you something. Say. There are no chances of Zeenat's survival What are you saying? Hey, You threw my corn. Don't you feel ashamed? Keep talking nonsense. I am not talking nonsense. I have heard this myself. Last night. Husna Aunty was telling mother that Zeenat will not survive and the doctor has also said that she is going to die, That's why my mother said that she will do business, bring customers for me. I bought customer, she started beating me. Where are you going Vodka? Listen, don't mention my name, everyone will beat me. Vodka? Vodka? You are coming from the hospital. How is Zeenat? Zeenat is in hospital? Yes Husna Aunty and Lafra have taken her to the hospital, don't you know this? Listen to me. Whisky, come let me feed you, I will not eat anything from your hand. Get lost, die starving. there has been a lot of change in you, You have changed But there has been no change in you. Have you met sister? She was sleeping. Sit She doesn't even know that I have come back. It doesn't feel like you have come after so many years. Every single thing is in its place. Sister hasn't let even a single thing move from its place, even your favourite things gets changed every week so what if you come at any time. That's why I told you that she is waiting for you even today, I don't know, she's doing everything for me or did she do it out of habit. Why it took so long for you to come? How did you get late?  I was coming straight home from the airport but on the way I saw Lafra, That broker? Yes, I don't know what happened to me after seeing him, everything started flashing in front of my eyes and In trance, I reached that area till Chanda's brothel. You met Chanda? No, maybe I would have found her if I had gone inside, but I could not go inside. Whatever I saw there, it blew my mind. A small child thought me a customer, he took me upstairs. Well, I was not paying attention to his words, I was just thinking about Chanda.   When that child told me that he is taking me as a customer for his mother than My mind burst and I ran away. You should not have gone there. I did not want to go there I don't know why and how I reached there Well leave it. Sit Sister is coming to the office? She used to come but has stopped coming since two-three months. I told you that loneliness and depression have made her suffer like this but now you have come, now it is your job to take care of her. I will try my best. Saeeda Auntie told that she stay awake and cry the whole night. I saw that she had become very weak. Yes, if a person lives alone at home for so long, then this is definitely happens to him. Well, now, you have come, maybe she will get better. I think that you should decide something about yourself and her.  What has happened to me. You are not dreaming, Sheram? Is this you? I arrived in afternoon. You should have wake me up. Where is the aunt? why didn't she wake me up? I said no to her, how are you? You were ill and didn't even tell me? No, I am absolutely fine. Saeeda Auntie must have told you this. I had forbidden her. Why? For how long you will hide your condition from me? I was in touch with Zahid about you. When I called here, Saeeda aunt told me. I could not stand it and I came back. You are still standing where I left you? How are you? I am also the same, I am standing where I was standing before. I will bring you coffee. No, I will make coffee. You rest I am fine, nothing happened, I just got a minor illness. Whatever it is, I will make the coffee, Okay? By living alone, I have learned to make very good coffee, You should not have stayed alone till now, Shehram And you?  I am making coffee, you wait, I am saying, I am absolutely fine. Okay anyway, for so long I have been wanting to drink the coffee made by you. Please bring medicine, Doctor has written. How is my daughter? Her BP is high I am bringing   [Music] Because of you, Zeenat is in this condition. Because of you she is here.  Don't make noise Vodka. Why not? You made her do dance The doctor forbade not to make any noise here. Come, come with me. Come on, sit here, Pray for her. Pray, my Zeenat recover. I will pray and you will make her sick again by making her dance. What type of mother you are?  There is no pain in your heart but now I won't let her dance. I won't let her dance I will earn and feed her, I will marry her, this is true, but you can't marry her. She is dying, she is dying, she will not survive, you don't know she has AIDS You are lying, you are lying, She can't marry anyone. She is dying. No. She can't die. She can't die. I won't let her die. I won't let her die. If anything happens to her, I will set all the brothel on fire. Are you listening?  I will kill everyone, I will not let her die.  I will not let her die.  I will not  Vodka, don't tell her anything.  Shall I go to Zeenat? Yes but remember, don't tell her anything. What will I tell her? [Crying] The doctor was saying that we have to give courage to Zeenat, if Zeenat develops courage, then who knows her age may increase, so you have to give her courage, Think yourself, if something happens to Zeenat, then our house would feel empty. How will we survive without her? I will die  I am alive for her. Stay strong Vodka. But sometimes miracles happen, too. You have to take care of her. I will not let her die, I will not let her die [Music]   [Music] [Music] [Applause]   [Music] Don't vanish like before otherwise I will not forgive you. Now, tell me   I brought this for you For me? Why? You didn't like it? It's good  You love me a lot?  [Laughter] You are very innocent Wear this locket, You make me wear. Me? Off course you.
