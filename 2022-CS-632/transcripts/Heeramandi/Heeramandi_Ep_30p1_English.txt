Let me tell you one thing Shumail I cannot leave Zarka, and I will never leave her. I did not know that you were such a mean, selfish and careless woman. Perhaps Allah showed me all this so that your reality could be visible What is her reality? Courtesan? dancing? singing? She is bought and sold? Murad, wives are not bought and sold. I don't know whether you are telling the truth or a lie because I have never seen brothel nor have I ever seen her dancing. You had told me that she was a courtesan and you had told me that she was an unsellable courtesan .... Enough! I don't want to argue on this topic You will not take the decisions of my life. I will do. I am going to take Zarka. I have decided that I cannot leave Zarka now but because of Shumail's actions I don't know where she has gone. She must have gone to her home and when any girl goes back to the brothel with her own choice, you cannot forcefully keep her She has not gone there willingly and even if she had gone, I would not let her stay there Sir, think for yourself the woman with whom you spent time, you used her, so after using her you will throw her out like this? She has been with me for a long time, and even if I had spent even one night with her, I would not have thought of leaving her. You should not think this way for a courtesan. You had bought that woman. A woman is not a thing to be bought and sold. Woman is just a woman and you and Shumail had told me that no one had even touched her before me, so a woman who does not want to be sold, how she can be courtesan? Murad, now she is gone, and it is better for you to forget her. There are many such meetings in life, mistakes which a person forgets, For God's sake Aunty, she was not my mistake, she was my commitment and you and Shumail forced me to do all this? Circumstances had forced us to do all this, but ...  by the compulsion of circumstances, but is the mental and physical relationship with a woman is so meaningless that a person should forget her? No Aunty, If a person has a relationship with someone, then it is with full heart and soul Every moment spends with her stays inside and I cannot be so selfish to use someone and then throw like this Sir ... I can't stoop so low or indulge in such disgraceful actions. [Music] How will she spend her life? She will never forget the pain of this relationship. What will she do? Have you thought about this? She became my wife. She became the mother of my child The child could not survive is a different matter, but if not, today then tomorrow she will definitely become my child's mother Well, for now go home and take care of Shumail, she is so upset that she can do something. I had received a call and she was crying a lot.  Go and take care of her, Sir, I don't know where Zarka lives but I will bring her back and she will live with me in the same house However, please tell Shumail that now I will not agree to any of her wrong decision.   He is getting emotional, after all, he is a child, he doesn't even know that a courtesan is a courtesan. Shehram?   Hey Guddu .... You have come back, where did you go, my child? Lafray, they took Zarka, they took Zarka Hey, she has come back Zarka is back home. She is back? Hey Guddu ... Listen to me Whatever happened, consider it a dream and forget it, we cannot fight fate, whatever is written by God is final. We can't do anything, we can't do anything. Zarka ... Zarka ... Zarka .... I went to the hospital to take you, it is good that you have come yourself, I had thought that they had taken you, it is their father's jurisdiction that they would have taken you, now I will marry you, I swear to Allah, I will do whatever you say, now I will break a star from the sky and bring it for you. Why have you come here, you have ruined my daughter's life, now you will break the stars and bring? For whom? For this stone statue? This Zarka aunty, she is not a stone statue, Zarka, you are listening to me, tell everyone, tell everyone that you have come back because of me, and see, people have only money to give, to courtesan, no respect. Be thankful, your child also died, otherwise, these bastards would have snatched your child from you. Get up, get out of here, get out of here, you bastard, you have cursed my daughter She is ruined because of you, I am saying, Aunty, don't mess with me. Zarka was mine. Zarka Open the door; Zarka Open the door. Zarka, you are my fiancé. Now you remember that she is your fiancée. Hey, you had sold her considering her courtesan and your mother who gives lesson of decency did not tell you this that a woman is not sold only courtesan is sold, get lost from here, you filthy sewer worm Move from here. Zarka open the door. She is dead for you. Get out of here and if you don't go then I will kill you. Look, I beg you, have mercy on me. Zarka is mine, I will marry her. I swear I will keep her happy. Don't take my Zarka from me, I beg you. You have already ruined her life, what else do you want? Get out of here, mother call the police. Get out of here. I will not go! [music] Mother, Zarka is mine? She is mine. Zarka belongs to no one. Mother, I am a filthy sewer worm? I am a bastard I have no right to live. Why you give birth to me? If by mistake I was born you should have killed me soon after my birth. No, my child ... You should have put me in the garbage, dogs can pick me up I .... Then I wouldn't be called a bastard. Then I wouldn't witness this sorrow If I can't get anyone's love then why you kept me alive? On this brothel, where there is no 
 respects nor relations Here everyone is for sold mother, no one loves anyone, all are for sold. No my child I am your mother, this is not a relation? My son, this is my house, others call it a brothel, here is respect and relationship too, you are my child, my legitimate child I have given you birth knowingly. Illegitimate are those whose mother does not want to give birth to them and they are born, you are my son you are my child, my dear I never got sold I have never been with anyone; I am only your mother. only your mother. Mother, I have never received anyone's love. Don't say like this, I love you very much. I cradled you to sleep on my chest, son. You all are liars, no one loves me, everyone hates me, everyone hates me Hey Guddu, look here, look at me, do I hate you? I didn't bring you up like a child, I didn't make you sleep on my chest I ride you on my shoulders, your mother hates you? she loves you, crazy! My dear, you are legitimate child. I know your father, I know. No Habib. Oh, shut up, let me tell him, Habib, you had sworn. Shut up, let me tell, or he will go mad. You have father, I will take you to him. No child is illegitimate, his father is illegitimate, oh my prince I will take you to your father. Come, I will take you. Guddu, come my dear Guddu ... don't leave me, Guddu, stop. Guddu Guddu, don't leave me. Guddu, don't go. Leave me, I will die  I was alive only for you, son. [Music] It's all your fault, you never told him how much I love him, how deep is the relationship between him and me, you didn't tell him anything. I told him everything, Chande. He is crazy, his mind is not right, he will be alright soon. He will come back, don't worry, why are you crying?  Chanda don't cry, when you cry then something starts happening to my heart, my whole life has passed in a blink of an eye, where have I reached in my life, I have become old. My life was spent in the desire to marry you. I died in this desire, but you are still not mine. You will get Guddu back. I will bring him back to you Chanda ... I am about to die. Before I die, I want to remove the burden from my chest. I am guilty towards you; I lied to Shreham. he asked me, I said to him that you are a sex worker I lied that you are a sex worker Why did you do this? Why did you do this? Why did you do this? Why you did this? [Music] [Music] Chande, forgive me, I did it because I am selfish kill me, I am selfish. Love is selfish Forgive me.  I beg at your feet Hey Chanda Did you hurt your hand? I am bringing Guudu For God's sake, don't cry! [music]
