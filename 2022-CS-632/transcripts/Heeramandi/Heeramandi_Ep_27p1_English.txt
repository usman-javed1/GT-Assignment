Son, what luck you have got in life, you never got what you wanted. No one gets everything in life. Mother? And we even can't force. I was not in love with Whisky; I just wanted to settle down. If I cannot become part of this home, so what? I'll find another home. Why are you lying to me? I'm your mother.  And mothers know everything about what their children want. But, my dear, mothers are often very helpless. I couldn't give you anything in life. I don’t know if I can do anything more in the future. No, mother. I don't want anything from you. Don't worry. But then you always say that. Everyone has to face what fate has written for them. We've endured it until now, and we'll continue to live on. I can't see you sad, just wait for few days, Who knows if Zarka will Marry him or not? No, mother. I can't live my life hanging on the cross, once your hope is broken,  then it's over forever! Just stop thinking about it. Just don't think about anything. Rani, dear, I'm thinking about you. [Music] [Music] Assalamualaikum.
Walaikum salam. Are you okay?
Yes. Listen ...Yes. I don't feel like eating the food from home. Can you please take me out to eat? You know Shumail and her mood—how she reacts to everything. It will create a new trouble for me. I'm so sorry ... Please [Music] I was just thinking about finding out when you would come. Why? It’s been a while since we visited Aunty, so I thought we should go there. Alright, let's eat and then we’ll go.Yes, I'll get the food ready.  By the way, this new cooked one is pathetic. The food is really bad. We need to change him. Teach him. Who is there? Come in. Yes, Zarka. Sister, I don't like the food prepared by that cook. Its smell is making me feel vomit. Can you order something from outside for my meal? I was just telling Murad that this cook is absolutely useless. He is not cooking well. We have to change him, then let's go out somewhere and have dinner. She is also in the mood. Yes, sure. Thank you, sister. Go and change, get ready. I will call you in a while. Then we will leave They say if the pregnant woman is asking for something to eat should give her immediately. You've found a good excuse of Zarka. That's fine. I'll freshen up, and then we will go. Do like this, then this, take some chicken too  Come on, eat!  Hold it in the other hand One by one. Yes, yes, grab this first. Yes, that's right. Good, now you get it. Will you eat something else? No, fine. You know me well and have known me for a long time. Meeting with Chanda, you can call it my mistake or emotional phase, but that day... I mean that night is a part of my past. That night, I made a promise to Chanda, and to this day.  It has been stabbing my heart like a thorn. I just wanted to be free from that pain. Otherwise, meeting Chanda or continuing to meet her was not difficult for me. Listen. I have come to understand that a courtesan is just a courtesan. So then what were you trying to ask her that day?  I don't even know why I stopped her or what I wanted to say. anyway ... Zaira ... our life is peaceful I can't tolerate tension in your life or in my own. So please, after today, we won't discuss this topic anymore. And you know how loyal I am as a husband. Yes, I know. So, you must also know that I don't take lunch. And it's 10:30 PM, I'm really hungry. I'm so sorry. I'm setting table Then you're talking about going there. There will be a commotion. If Chanda auntie and Hema auntie find out, they will create a scene. And anyway, those people have already forbidden it. I don't care about them. That's why I'm saying you come with me. Only you can explain to Zarka. I will wait outside. And if Zarka wants, she can call me inside. I don’t know about it whisky. I don't know if Mom will even let me go. Do something, Rani. Tell Mom that you really want to meet Zarka. Just create some kind of situation. She'll understand. And you'll explain everything to her step by step. Also tell her that the Whisky is ready to fall in her feet. Look, look, I’m bowing down to you. Rani, you don't feel any pity for me. Leave my feet. Keep this all safe for Zarka. There is no use of begging here. You can do something for me. You are the one who understands my pain. And everyone else is insulting me in my pain. I understand your pain. That's the punishment I'm enduring. In front of your pain, I've even forgotten my own. I'm telling you, Rani. If I don't find Zarka, then I will be like a stray dog in dirty streets. I will give my life. Just talk to her once for my sake. Explain to her how much I’m suffering for her love. She will believe your words. Get up, leave my feet. Swear on my head. Swear that you will tell her everything. swear on my head! Yes, I swear on your head, I will explain it to her. You will tell her my situation honestly. Swear it. Yes, I will tell her everything. Just like your own feelings. Just like I would share my own feelings. You are so good. You are really wonderful, Rani.   Rani, don't talk about this And anyway, Hema has already told that they have forbidden everyone from coming home. And Chanda won't let you go. Mom, make up some excuse. Anyway, we will leave this place forever. Then whether we meet anyone in life or not. I haven't told Chanda about this yet. Why, Mom? I will tell her before leaving. If I tell her now, she will stop me. Then, Mom, please get me permission to go to Zarka's house.  Okay, I will talk, it is too late now. Please get up, turn off the light.  Go to sleep, I’m feeling sleepy too. Just go over there. By the way, Rani, I am very happy, I feel very good that you have come. I was very scared, I have come I had heard that you have refused everyone to come here. Yeah, because of the Whisky. He was trying to ruin my home. Oh well. You're saying this, Zarka? I can't forget all my life what he has done to me Now he is suffering for you. Like a wounded bird, falling in everyone's feet.  Now, even if he fall in my feet. There is no place for him in my heart  And then, Rani, try to understand. I have now become someone else's. But Zarka, Whiskey did all this for your benefit. My benefit? He neither kept the honor of the relationship nor  thought of his mother's pain nor my pain. He just wanted money which he got.  How many days of fun he must have had with that money? Zarka. Now forgive the Whisky, he realized when you left.  That he loves you. He loves you a lot.  I feel pity after seeing him. You will also see him,  you will also feel bad for him. A wife's heart never melts for another man Rani The one you are wife of, you have to leave him and all this and come back. I will still not take his help and I the days I will spend here with my husband. After that, his memories will become my support. My child will be my support. Will they allow you to meet your child? They won’t let me meet, but Rani... Will this feeling not enough that I have a legitimate child? In this city. Rani, try to understand. He can no longer make a place in my heart. There’s no space for him in my heart anymore. Zarka, Whisky will die without you. He will die. Let him die. if you care so much about him, then marry him [Music]  [Music] The person who is dying for you. How can I marry him? A person dying for you, how can he marry me? He has gone mad. make him understand that he should forget me. Don't talk like this Zarka.  have you forgotten? You too, loved Whisky very much. Yes, I loved him I loved him like crazy, I couldn't even think of living without him But now I have become someone else's, Rani. [Music]
