Oye, that's it, I have become silent because of my brother, otherwise I swear to God, you know your brother. Oye, now if he comes back after getting angry again, then it is good that I have not seen it, nor have I even said anything. You had to listen to him well, today it is your turn to wash the clothes, no friend, I will not do anything today, friend, I did not sleep the whole night yesterday, I did not sleep, do not talk much nonsense, keep boasting in your sleep all night, you have spoiled my mind, my friend. I saw in my dream that Zeenat Maan and I were dancing hand in hand. I think that if Zeenat Maan had not been a wife then she would not have danced for anyone but only for me. If she had not been a wife then why would she have danced? You keep babbling all night long, you have gone mad, you spoil your mind, I slept for a minute, if you keep babbling now at night, then I will pick you up and throw you out of the window and who made you donate money that night? Yes Yes, that's someone, I have to talk about some important thing, what important thing will I do, you friend, don't stay like Lokan, it is not wrong to say 'Changi Gal', he is very rotten, he is going, take care Champa, I am very scared, I don't know what Seth Karim will do . Doctorate is also about to come, don't know what will happen, seeing Chanda Chanda, who knows, if a son is born, then only he can leave all the work, if he has a child with a woman, then people also give him work and their right when he is young. Then it will be done, you leave all this and go away and you know that if you have a young son, then the woman can sleep with him, but I am telling you out of sympathy, don't tell anyone, oh no, you are right, really, if my If I have a son, I will not stay here. Hey brother, it was with great difficulty that the thought came to Seth Karim's mind. As soon as I left, I fell at his feet, folded my hands and apologized. I apologized even with my lap. Only then did the matter cool down a bit and Afzal was the one. So I was in the process of getting Lafda inside, I was very scared, I was very scared, these people have long hands, I told Seth Karim that Chachanda is going to be a mother, how can I send her, it was good, he said that no scoundrels are allowed here. Send it, oh where did you say no, why not, I also said this clearly, the girls refused to come and started saying I will come, then I will come myself, ok let me come, oh Champa, oh Champa, I will see if my mother or Husna Bhai If they find out anything, they will kill me. Don't worry, I won't tell anyone. Okay, take care of yourself. Yes, now I have come, why don't you talk to your father-in-law? What I mean is that you go to Salman uncle and talk to him. Shahram , you don't know many things, your mother knows everything, she has helped me a lot, I even talked to Salman uncle once, but he just gave a vague answer and said that I am fine and I did not speak in favor of Rehan but I think he also wants to give away this house. However, I am surprised that Salman uncle knows very well that you do not have parents, you do not have any relatives. Here, if this house is sold then where will you go, still thinking like this, it was just my bad luck that Rehman's death was an accident, if there was a child then neither would these people's attitude nor this would have happened to me, whatever be the case, you are their daughter-in-law, aren't you? Where are you, daughter-in-law Jairam, you are afraid of those people, I am not afraid of anyone, but when you have to live in this world, you have to walk with the people of the world, if you ever have any problem, you call me and you should definitely think about this. Leave it to me that you are the only one, you are telling the truth, and now you don't even come to meet me, what should I do, you call me when you have to go, yes, I also feel like talking, if you talk to aunty or Zeenat, then only that. The old talk of dancing and singing or singing songs is no longer the same thing as before. Now Hasti used to talk inside you. Earlier all that is over. Sometimes she used to call us for ice cream. Now [Music] Tu Lafaad Yes, are all men cheaters [Music] No no no Chanda Not all men are cheaters No cheaters Husna Aunty says all men are unfaithful and cheaters Na Aunty How does she know, has she ever tried any man in her life? And I have tried it and I didn't even say anything to her, she herself said that I will marry you, I just made up for this mistake of mine, leave her, now forget her, she never came back, all the throat cares, tell me, do you need something? [Music] Tujhe buta la de buta la If someone from the sky asks you to break the pieces, then let's give you Butala, just take care of yourself Chachanda, my heart gets spoiled. Son ke teri wala I aayi Husna Husna, who is I coming? Hey Doctorni Sahiba, Salam alekum, Well am I fine, Chanda, Chanda, I am fine in my room, come doctor, come chachanda doctor sa chanda chada, where are you going chanda and what is the matter with her brother. What has happened, Lafe, do you understand? Ask him, who brought up this child, his father, his brother, his father, neither his father nor his father, I will get him, save me, I will get him, sister-in-law, why are you being defamed, why are you being defamed, because you are our daughter- in-law? You were my daughter-in-law. Now I am not. If I were still your daughter-in-law, your attitude towards me would not have been like this. If you had stayed with us, then today you were our sister. Rehman died, but we are people. It is true that even today I am Zaira. I have come on Salman's request, he has said that you should come and live with us and sell this house, you know that I will not sell this house, then it is okay, brother, you are asking me to go to the court, the case is over, you know Sadika. Aunty, I have no other place to go, why am I? Come and stay with us, that is not the place, are you perhaps forgetting that you were the one who had thrown me out of that house, otherwise perhaps I would have been living with you even today. So when did you consider the house as a home and how did you live like a guest? Anyway, we cannot stay here for long. Abba had said to finish talking and come back. Anyway, it is very difficult to explain to Rehan Bhai, you know it very well. That you cannot win the case, the result will be the same without going to the court, and you should stop all these types of people coming to your house, you stop talking nonsense, there is no need for you to interfere in my caste matter so much. It is not your caste issue, even today you are sitting in our name and people think that you are our daughter-in-law, that day also Rihan had come to the locality, people have told 10 different things to us, so if we are not being defamed. Who else is saying 'Salaam- Welcome'? The house has been kept as a crossroads. He is walking towards the one with his mouth raised. Listen to whom he is saying, 'You Shahram, you go inside, I am coming, Amma got up from brother, who the people of the locality had heard and went away. You are seeing the same thing with your eyes today, now you must have understood why she doesn't want to live with us, what are you saying Shahram, you go from here [music] Please don't talk nonsense Tayaba, the reason for not staying in your house. Your words were No need to play too many tricks Simply vacate this house and forgive us Go and stay anywhere Let's go [Praise] [Music] [Praise] [Music] Now you know why I am not with these people They are very ill-mannered people, I told you that I talk to the same uncle, there is no use, he is also exactly like that, tell me, what is the use, the lawyer is making the agreement, in fact he must be coming, what is this slander? We were talking that sometimes I feel like strangulating her to death. Lara herself went away, leaving this trouble for me and the second uproar happened when the police station came, but left Chanda because of the child. She has told me 100 100. It's good that she got a change, otherwise we would have kept getting locked up in the police station every day. Leave it to her. Hey, whatever has happened has happened, don't keep chasing Chanda all the time. Hey Husna khala, a small child will come to the house. And I like children so much, I like them so much, what should I tell you? Well, you gave this lesson to Chanda, not she, I do n't even know that there is such a thing, now just keep quiet, tell me what Chanda is doing, hey. What to do, she lies on the bed the whole day. Today she is going to the doctor with Zeenat. Okay, just pray that Allah gives her a daughter, Amen, she will be bright, so don't curse like this Zeenat, I am cursing a little, I am just saying this. I am wondering what will happen if it is a girl, I will die under the train, don't talk nonsense, look, I am not going with you, just go alone, I don't know where she is going, where is she going, listen to her words. She says that if it is a girl then she will commit suicide by coming under the train and she does n't even know anything, I am not going with her, call Amma, she will take her, I will come with you, but don't talk like this or you will displease Allah. There are things to be done, you don't know, Allah knows how many prayers I cry at night, either give me a son or don't let me and the daughter live, how can he get angry, can't I see, if a daughter is born then another one. Only Tawaf will be born and we can't see what is our life [Music] Even if there is no respect then what is the use of living, if a daughter is born then neither will I myself be alive nor will I let her live. Have you heard? You are talking so much nonsense, go take her away, I am not going, oh oh oh my daughter, whatever happens is a blessing from Allah, you are doing wonders, oh daughter or son, it is an excuse to live. What else is there just to live, I don't want to quarrel Okay [Music] Come on [Music] Or please sit Sharaya I wanted to talk to you, that's why I came Well done, if you had not come then maybe I would have come What will you take, not tea or coffee No, nothing. Anyway, your parents have gone out, you live alone and you have to go somewhere even to eat and drink. You have a lot of knowledge about me, Shahram Mia, whatever I talk to you, you will listen to it with a very cool heart and mind. She used to live here and used to meet you people, it was fine but she lives alone and the whole world knows that she is our daughter-in-law, your coming and going to her house like this defames her and us too, Salman uncle, you are an accusation on a decent woman. They are defaming her and that too in this age defamation does not see age. Shahram Mia, I have come to you because of my relation with sir and you will understand my point and explain to Zara that she should leave the house and come back to us . That is, where she has no respect, she should go there and anyway, her husband had given her that house, so you people should respect her, on the contrary, you are defaming her, she is getting defamed because of you, Shahram. If he is so noble then why don't you marry him [music]
