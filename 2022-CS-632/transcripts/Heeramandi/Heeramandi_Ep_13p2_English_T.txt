[0.28] No dear, I just had the halwa puri. Shall I tell you something. Say. There are no chances of Zeenat's survival
[7.16] What are you saying? Hey, You threw my corn. Don't you feel ashamed?
[12.36] Keep talking nonsense. I am not talking nonsense. I have heard this myself. Last night.
[18.00] Husna Aunty was telling mother that Zeenat will not survive and the doctor has also said that she is going to die,
[22.56] That's why my mother said that she will do business, bring customers for me.
[27.20] I bought customer, she started beating me.
[31.40] Where are you going Vodka? Listen, don't mention my name, everyone
[37.60] will beat me. Vodka? Vodka? You are coming from the hospital. How is Zeenat?
[46.60] Zeenat is in hospital? Yes Husna Aunty
[51.68] and Lafra have taken her to the hospital, don't you know this?
[56.04] Listen to me. Whisky, come let me feed you,
[65.08] I will not eat anything from your hand. Get lost, die starving. there has been a lot of change in you,
[73.16] You have changed But there has been no change in you. Have you met sister?
[79.04] She was sleeping. Sit
[83.04] She doesn't even know that I have come back.
[87.80] It doesn't feel like you have come after so many years. Every single thing is in its place. Sister
[96.16] hasn't let even a single thing move from its place, even your favourite
[101.04] things gets changed every week so what if you come at any time.
[105.12] That's why I told you that she is waiting for you even today,
[111.20] I don't know, she's doing everything for me or did she do it out of habit. Why it took
[120.64] so long for you to come? How did you get late?
[124.32]  I was coming straight home from the airport but on the way
[129.84] I saw Lafra,
[134.48] That broker? Yes, I don't know what happened to me after seeing him,
[141.76] everything started flashing in front of my eyes and In trance, I
[147.16] reached that area till Chanda's brothel. You met Chanda?
[153.72] No, maybe I would have found her if I had gone inside,
[159.24] but I could not go inside.
[164.08] Whatever I saw there, it blew my mind.
[169.32] A small child thought me a customer, he took me upstairs.
[176.24] Well, I was not paying attention to his words,
[182.00] I was just thinking about Chanda.
[186.09]  
[189.52] When that child told me that he is taking me as a customer for his mother
[195.88] than
[199.04] My mind burst and I
[208.08] ran away. You should not have gone there. I did not want to go there
[214.28] I don't know why and how I reached there Well leave it. Sit
[222.36] Sister is coming to the office? She used to come but has stopped coming since two-three months.
[230.84] I told you that loneliness and depression have made her suffer like this but now
[235.60] you have come, now it is your job to take care of her.
[240.72] I will try my best. Saeeda Auntie told that she stay awake and cry the whole night.
[248.28] I saw that she had become very weak. Yes, if a person lives alone at home for so long,
[254.68] then this is definitely happens to him. Well, now, you have come, maybe she will get better.
[259.12] I think that you should decide something about yourself and her. 
[300.92] What has happened to me. You are not dreaming,
[309.52] Sheram?
[313.64] Is this you? I arrived in afternoon. You should have wake me up. Where is the aunt?
[322.52] why didn't she wake me up? I said no to her, how are you?
[328.72] You were ill and didn't even tell me? No, I am absolutely fine. Saeeda Auntie must have told you this.
[336.04] I had forbidden her. Why? For how long you will hide your condition from me?
[342.36] I was in touch with Zahid about you.
[345.92] When I called here, Saeeda aunt told me. I could not stand it and I
[358.64] came back. You are still standing where I left you?
[366.10] How are you?
[371.28] I am also the same, I am standing where I was standing before.
[378.04] I will bring you coffee. No, I will make coffee. You rest
[385.68] I am fine, nothing happened, I just got a minor illness. Whatever it is,
[392.92] I will make the coffee, Okay? By living alone, I have learned to make very good coffee,
[399.92] You should not have stayed alone till now, Shehram
[408.44] And you?
[413.14]  I am making coffee, you wait, I
[422.52] am saying, I am absolutely fine. Okay anyway, for so long I have
[428.52] been wanting to drink the coffee made by you.
[446.48] Please bring medicine, Doctor has written. How is my daughter? Her BP is high
[454.04] I am bringing
[458.99]  
[461.33] [Music]
[470.48] Because of you, Zeenat is in this condition. Because of you she is here. 
[475.68] Don't make noise Vodka.
[477.68] Why not? You made her do dance
[482.60] The doctor forbade not to make any noise here. Come, come with me.
[489.48] Come on, sit here,
[506.24] Pray for her.
[512.16] Pray, my Zeenat recover. I will pray and you
[519.60] will make her sick again by making her dance. What type of mother you are? 
[524.80] There is no pain in your heart
[527.56] but now I won't let her dance. I won't let her dance
[532.40] I will earn and feed her, I will marry her,
[538.44] this is true, but you can't marry her. She is dying,
[546.40] she is dying, she will not
[553.08] survive, you don't know she has AIDS
[559.80] You are lying, you are lying,
[566.68] She can't marry anyone.
[571.36] She is dying.
[579.80] No. She can't die. She can't
[585.96] die. I won't let her die. I won't let her die.
[593.84] If anything happens to her, I will set all the brothel on fire. Are you listening? 
[601.00] I will kill everyone, I will not let her die.
[607.33]  I will not let her die.
[614.15]  I will not 
[619.44] Vodka, don't tell her anything.
[626.60]  Shall I go to Zeenat? Yes but remember, don't tell her anything. What will I tell her?
[636.84] [Crying]
[645.76] The doctor was saying that we
[650.72] have to give courage to Zeenat, if Zeenat develops courage, then who knows
[656.16] her age may increase, so you have to give her courage, Think yourself,
[661.76] if something happens to Zeenat, then
[667.68] our house would feel empty. How will we survive without her?
[673.36] I will die 
[679.80] I am alive for her. Stay strong Vodka. But sometimes miracles happen, too.
[689.64] You have to take care of her.
[700.12] I will not let her die,
[704.52] I will not let her die
