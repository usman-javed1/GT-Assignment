I don't know how Zeenat would be, she even eat anything or not? Don't worry,  I made chicken broth and shami kebab for her, you take it with you. Maybe she will eat. Auntie, I have come to go to the hospital with you, Chanda has already visited Okay Auntie, you take her. Okay, you get ready, I tell Lafrah to stop the taxi. Auntie, I am very sorry that doctor has said that Zeenat is not going to survive. Why are you talking nonsense? You are blabbering without thinking about whom to talk to. It doesn't matter Chanda, now it doesn't matter, ask a mother's heart, what is she going through. Seeing her child go in front of her, Life and death are in Allah's hand. Maybe our Zeenat recovers. she gets better. See who is here. You bought her home? Dr allow her to go? Doctor said that she will be fine in a few days, she will run, Vodka, why did you bring her home? Shall I leave her to die in hospital?  Doctor said take her home, there is nothing left in her. At any time  How come Shehram? How did uncle and auntie die? why didn't you tell me? what should I tell you? What could you have done, They met with an accident. You went there? When I reached there, Baba Jaan was conscious, but mother How do people pass from among us and we do not even realise, Still we do not value people.  After their death we realise what we have lost and what gained. You know, I could not sleep peacefully there even for one night, I just kept thinking that you are alone.    I was not alone. Saeeda Auntie was with me. you were alone. I am still alone I am no longer the old Shehram, I can get my point across and I have come with a decision that I will not live alone, Tell me what happened? Our Zeenat is leaving us, Where is she going? She is sick, in the hospital. She is leaving the world. She is dying, She is going to God. People die when they grow old, Zeenat can't die, Do one thing. You marry her, she won't die. she won't I will marry her, yes, I will marry her, she should get some happiness, but what will I do if she dies? How I will live without her. Don't cry Vodka We will pray, she will be fine.  Lafray, Get me married to Zeenat. No dear, you will die. Have you gone mad? Yes, I am mad. Get me married to her, I want to give her some happiness.  who knows, may she get saved. Maybe she get's courage by new life, may she get the hope of living, who knows. I beg to you. hold your feet, friend. What happened to you my dear.  Please get me married. For God's sake. How this can be possible, Lafrah? Think yourself, have gone crazy  Everything is possible. The biggest thing is that it can happen because of Vodka's luck. Maybe Zeenat survive. He is right In this way, Vodka's wish will be fulfilled. Our Zeenat Will take one happiness with her. Zeenat is dying but why do you guys want to kill Vodka? If he marry's Zeenat, then he will also catch this disease. Don't worry about him, he knows everything, he will take care of it and then the biggest thing is Zeenat don't know, go and tell her, Go. [music]  [music] Now you are asking me to marry? Why what happened now? Mother, I am sick, why didn't you ask me when I was in good health, Now Vodka will take care of me through out my life. You will be fine, Mother, you used to say that courtesan can't become anyone's wife.  never marry. But she can Today I am regretting I wish I would be like Dil Ara. And make you dance only I wish these thoughts had occurred to me earlier Being born in a courtesan's house does not mean that you cannot take up any other profession, it is on a person's own will, washing someone's clothes, you can make a living even by washing utensils, isn't it? Mother if you realise your mistake in advance, than you never commit a mistake.  You are making a mistake again by marrying me to Vodka. This is not a mistake, You don't want to become a Bride? Mother, Which girl doesn't feel that she should get married and make her own home, that's why I say, you marry Vodka. He loves you very much. Greetings Auntie [Music] [Music] Zeenat [Music] You loves me very much? Yes Wants to marry me? Yes You know that I am sick You will recover, I will get you treated Treatment The doctor said that you will be completely fine, We will not stay here, will go away from here and will stay at some good place. I just want you to be happy, just dress up for me. I don't know for how long I have been dreaming of making you my bride, why didn't you do this before Vodka? I did but you didn't agree. How could I have agreed Vodka. Since childhood, the point was made clear that a courtesan never marries  and cannot raise children, she can only feed herself. The whole world works like this? a woman in the world does thousands of jobs, she can do many jobs. You can also do it,   Man, I always misunderstood Chanda but she is good. I am hating myself, I used to bring customers for you, you were so sick and I used to bring customers for you.  Sorry friend, I got emotional. Don't worry, everything will be fine, Tell me, you will become my bride? In your hands apply mehndi of my name? Yes [music]
