[0.40] Amma, I am telling you that whatever has happened, it
[5.52] is all Chanda's fault, neither would she have become a pasani, nor would all this have happened, even now I am telling you that no matter how hard Lafda tries,
[11.64] the police station will not leave Chanda, no one will guard her for how long. And yes Ama, if
[19.40] Chanda had not slapped her then the police officer would have picked her up and taken her to Nana.
[24.36] Just like she used to babble before, she would still babble now. At the most, he
[28.64] would have pinched her like he used to do at least. Hey, shut
[33.40] up, I am getting worried thinking that
[39.48] what would happen if that human police officer took revenge, Amma, even if he took revenge, would he say anything to Chanda? Yes,
[46.56] do something for us. Take that Amma, look, let me explain to you, now she is not alone,
[52.20] she has another stomach too, oh poor Zeenat, how long will she earn for her,
[57.72] she has become ill, she dances a little and sits holding me, yes, what happened now? So I drank the milk, I
[64.80] drank it now, I know aunty, raising a child
[70.28] is not an easy task, you already owe me a lot,
[73.96] but for this I am not going to earn a favor myself, Chanda, what else can we do
[80.56] and then I will give it to you. He owes us less. Hey, this room is his only.
[86.08] I was saying that the expenses for the child would have been Rs. 100. I said no aunty,
[93.32] don't worry, I will dance and sing, but remember one thing, I will not let anyone come close, then only he
[100.84] will dance. How much will you earn by singing? Whatever you earn will be enough for us. Did
[107.52] n't you listen to what the DSP was saying? He was saying that he will not throw out everyone. I don't believe that
[112.04] these policemen, from the constable to the officer,
[117.28] people do not hesitate to make rounds. Oh, don't you worry about the police officer, you see, if he had wanted to do something
[124.36] , he would have done
[127.36] it, stop drinking, he will die after drinking, don't worry,
[135.56] listen to me, see had you not come back, otherwise you
[140.36] would have killed me. I
[145.80] love you a lot, I love you a lot, I love you a lot, you used to
[153.92] tell me that you won't let anyone touch you, I used to be very happy, I used to be very happy,
[160.68] Chand, you don't want to be sold, so I swear to God, I will sell you. I don't want
[168.24] you to fuck me,
[173.84] you marry me,
[181.92] haven't you gone mad? You know I love Shehram, he
[187.16] is my Guddu's father [Music]
[195.92] And that is a matter of one night, one night can be important. You lost her, you
[204.68] became her in one night and I, who have
[209.20] been in love with you for so many years [Music]
[212.24] I did not even think of you,
[216.12] love doesn't take time, love doesn't take time, it happens in a moment,
[222.24] how did I know that I have to fall in love with her. When he talked about marriage,
[230.68] I started dreaming, I
[237.20] will leave the area to live a decent life
[241.83] [Music] Lafde tell me that Chanda is really
[245.20] waiting for Sharam, I mean last night she was waiting for Sharam. Oh , I was waiting for
[252.48] someone else, of course, I was waiting, I mean, the money
[257.36] was to be taken from you sir, but then that other customer has come, our work is done, he has
[263.32] gone after paying double the money, he was an honest man, he was a very honest man. Our golden jubilee is over.
[270.52] Sh Ram Sh Ram Lafde, please pray that he comes back.
[278.08] O he has not come back, he has got married and gone away. Forget him,
[286.76] this cannot happen by not remembering him
[290.76] . I will remain sitting in his name for the whole life, don't forget. I can
[295.36] fuck her when you and I get married,
[301.28] you and I will go far away from here with our Guddu,
[306.76] I will get the child far away, I will work hard, I will work as a laborer, you
[314.60] don't like dancing and singing, neither do I, I don't like it.
[317.36] Do you think that I don't take you from here because I think that you will do it?
[322.08] That's why I didn't go from here, otherwise
[326.04] I would have left long ago. No, this can't be possible,
[331.64] I will keep doing this until Guddu grows up and
[337.68] doesn't start going to school. I will not keep doing it.
[343.08] Okay, you want to earn like Zeenat and Ma
[350.47] [music] You want to earn like Zeenat and Emma,

[749.72] destiny gets broken by the end of the relationship, relationships made by humans.
[755.52] Yes, but the relationships created by God are lines on stone. You may
[761.48] be very perfect, you argue a lot, everything is your wish, you have never
[768.32] listened to anything of mine, what do you want to make

[811.66] [Music] Hey my Champa Rani, she is a big
[818.60] heroine of films, isn't she? Sari Ikar Sahab has made this his own show, Zeba Khan Sangeeta
[825.80] Kavita, I did not know anything, this sir has
[830.76] made it a hit in his films. Hi, you have made Shivaji a heroine. Yes, she
[838.32] is a big heroine and now I am making a new film. I am the girl who is coming in it,
[843.52] ay hi hi hi extra, she was an extra, now she will become number one Ron, number one Istakar
[851.80] ji me bhi na me bhi, you make me a heroine like Jeva ji, speak slowly, people
[857.20] are watching, they will know that such a big producer is sitting. Iftekhar ji is
[862.08] here, now you just take me in your film, I
[867.20] act very well, Javed has seen my acting and asked him,
[871.32] I wish I could call you to my house, then you would have come and seen my acting yourself. Oh ji, she
[878.08] would copy Shabnam like this. People think that I am Shabnam only, Shabnam, you
[885.64] are much better than Shabnam, Champa ji, you have big guts,
[892.28] oh guts, advice, fun, acting ji, that is Aasta Bhoot, how
[902.48] heavy is it for you, only then you understand that You have become a heroine, there is a lot of elasticity in your body
[909.64] and flexibility has also increased and you know that
[915.00] it is very important to portray a heroine in films. What did you do? Iftikhar Saheb asked Javed, 'Dance, I do this
[920.96] when I dance.' So you look no less than any film heroine. Oh, just think
[926.40] that you have become a heroine, but for this you
[931.88] will have to come to Lahore. Yes, Lahore, I cannot go anywhere, so Amma
[937.68] does not let me go to the market. How will Lahore let me go,
[941.72] think about it, Champa. If sir, they make films,
[947.76] you want to become a heroine, then you will have to go, otherwise you and your
[957.20] mother are fine to become heroines, so I will leave everything.
[961.44] I can, I will come to Lahore, it's a sure thing, yes, it's a sure thing, it's
[968.08] my dream to become a heroine, I can't give up my dream, here you become a heroine, there it's raining notes on you,
[974.08] it's raining rain, it's raining, how good it will feel
[982.00] here. So you have to cry for every rupee, work, do labour, tire yourself, then
[988.00] go somewhere and get Rs. 100-200, Ifat ji, then the matter is settled, you keep it
[995.04] in advance, ha, advance, say
[1000.53] [music] No, but Ifat ji, I am not going with you right now.
[1008.08] Will I be able to come home without informing Amma? Amma came to know that I will leave late otherwise Amma
[1014.24] will beat me and I am not going to let you go anywhere. I
[1018.88] will drop you home and come back. You just keep the promise of going to Lahore and have caught the advance. If you think of
[1027.36] Lahore then I will. I will go after all, I want to become a heroine, if
[1035.30] [music] Ji Sadke
