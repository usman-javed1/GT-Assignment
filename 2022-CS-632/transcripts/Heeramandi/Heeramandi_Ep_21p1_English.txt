Hey, look, I've even shown you the sea today! It’s not just a sea view; it’s the real ocean! Look how the water is splashing up! Yes Hey, look! Just look! I’m feeling scared.  Oh, I'm here for you! Whisky! If I call you Shehryar... So you wouldn’t feel bad, right? I don’t like your name, Whisky Hey, what's in a name? You can call me anything! After all, it’s just money—nothing more.  Tell me one thing. Shall I tell you something, the way our mothers carry themselves with dignity... This won't change anything for anyone. I say... If you also get chance like Zarka... avail it. I swear everyone will be stunned! I swear. But Shehryar, my heart wants to... Hey, listen, listen, listen! Call me Whisky.  It seems like you're calling someone else.  Okay, Whisky. By the way, do you have a heart or not? It should be there; I’ve never seen it, but it must be somewhere. It must be lost; I'll just have to find it.  Hey, the gol gappay! You’ll eat. Shall I bring? But you said you would take me to a big hotel and treat me to food. Hey, I’ll take you there too. Just be patient!  You know what?  I’ve heard the food there is really delicious! Big people come there. That’s why I want you to come with me. I want to go there to eat.  not to make customers Hey, first bring the gol gappay for you, and then I’ll take you there too. I wish you had a heart in your chest too. As deep as this ocean. Just praying to Allah that I get a good proposal for Pari as well. Get her married too! Assalamualaikum.
Walaikum Assalam. Please have a seat. Zarka, the volume of tv is too loud; the sound is going outside. Yes. Yes, I am very grateful to you. No, there’s no need to be grateful. There’s a agreement between you and me. When that is fulfilled, the matter will be settled. Yes, I just came to meet my daughter.  I'm really happy to see her happy. Married daughters look very good.  I wanted to say something to you. If I take Zarka with me... We’ll drop her back in the evening. Mother Not in the evening. We'll drop her off at night. In fact, if she stays even at night, it would be even more fun! I am sorry, she can’t go anywhere. As long as she is with us, she can't go anywhere. What’s going on, Aunty? How can we just leave her like that? Should we end all our meetings and interactions with her?  No, I’m not saying to stop meeting or interacting. Just like you all came over now, you can come like that again. That was the agreement, right? No, that wasn’t the agreement. Just be quiet.  Yes, this was the agreement. You have a right over Zarka. Will do as you want. It's not about right,  It's about commitment and principles. Yes, you’re absolutely right. As you wish. Mother, this is what I’ve seen always. On the first day after the wedding, the girl goes to her Parent's home. Be quiet. Alright, sister. I won’t go anywhere. Rani, look over there. She's looking at that place. One day, I'll make so much money that I'll build my house in the water. There will be cold water below. Cool, refreshing breeze, and I'll take you everywhere with me. And if we perish into the water... Hey, you’ve gone crazy! I mean like this... I'll dive in and come back up; I know how to swim. Really? Yes, why not? By the way, Whisky, my heart wants to... we both go to Dubai. Hey, what we will do in Dubai? Our city is Karachi. You’ve not seen its colors. Yes, that’s true.Do you know? Since I’ve come to Karachi... I’m really enjoying it. How many days has it been since you came? Just keep watching; you'll see what you like in our city. By the way, the reason Karachi feels good is... someone else too. Hey, you’re not involved with someone, are you? Yes, there is. Come on, tell me who it is! We're friends. Just tell me who it is! I'm not telling. Come on, just tell me! Look, you don't trust me. Just tell me. You’ll figure it out yourself. Hey, is it that old man Lafarh? You know Habib,  That woman who came to negotiate for Zarka, right? I already know her. Chanda, how do you know her? You remember, Police man kidnapped me? When I escaped from there... That's time I met that woman. Yes, I rememeber, you told me, she took you to her house I recognise her as I saw. She also recognise me. She was asking me I have seen you somewhere. But I changed the topic What should I say? Now I think, it's a small world. Years before a woman helped me I can not even imagine, I will ever meet her again in life and her problems will bring her here. Sometimes I think, If ever I see Guudu's father then what I will do? I should stop going out. By the way, Chande ... What If you ever found Guudu's father in real then what you will do? I don't know. May be I will hold his collar and ask him .... why you left in my womb? But then I think, I don't have any right If I ever see him, I will hit him hard. I swear to God You know Whisky, I am scared of Camel. Why are you scared of camel, he is an innocent animal. He is not innocent, he is so big. I feel I will fall after sitting on it. He is tall Hey, water is cold. Don't throw on me. I will also throw on you. Here you go ... Hey, watch out. You will slip, I will get in trouble. Come here. You Okay? Yes Okay ... Then take this. I am all wet Rani, this is Park Tower. All rich people of Karachi shops here. Clothes, Jewellry, Shoes Here they have vegetable shop too. They do even grocery here also. Are sure Whisky? Definately, Let's go up by lift God's Blessing. World is so advance Listen, do not touch anything here. If anything break then we have to pay full cost of it. What do you mean Whisky? It's not my first experience to market. Actually this place is for elites. Everything is available here. Look there, jewellry shop, Clothes shop even shoes too. Come ... [Music] Let's go here. Wow, they have beautiful things. Look at this. Things are expensive here. I'll buy for you from other place. I know you have money today. You buy me something today. If we like anything then we will see. Hey, Whisky ... this is so pretty. Check the price tag. Now, you know? I never thought this will happen to my daughter. Have patience. Mother, quite now. You yourself did this all. Keep your mouth shut. I am already worried. What happened? Hema, everything is fine? Where is Zarka? What happened? Why are you always crying? They did not allowed her to come with us. What was wrong in sending her for a day? Where is Whisky? I will ask him, what deal he made with them? She is alive not dead, that we can not meet her neither she can come here. Okay enough! You tell me Hema what happened exactly?  They are right. Agreement says, Unless the baby is not born she cannot come back.  But Hema, there is no harm in allowing her for a day The agreements says she will stay there. Not a day, they can't allow her even for an hour. You people have forgotten, they took Zarka from brothel. No one will trust us. How ever we say that our girls are innocent, but still they are prostitute for rest of the world. Still you are crying Hema. Once you made a commitment so its done. They at least did not stopped you from meeting her. If they stop you from seeing her than let me know, I will talk to them They never stopped me from seeing her. Then, no big deal. Have you gone mad? How can she leave? Unless she gives birth, hands the baby over to us, she cannot go. We cannot trust her; she is a prostitute. What if she goes back and forms a relationship with another man? I don't want a child I got scared in just a single day. I cannot tolerate her Ask Murad to divorce her and send her back home. I will clear her all amount What are you talking? What is wrong with you Shumail? If that's what you wanted to do, then why did you create this whole scene? Shehram scolded me; you and Murad had fights because of all this. Is it a joke, that we will give them 10 lacs. Let the purpose be fulfilled. Tolerate this all now. I cannot. I feel she will take Murad away from me. I don't know you just talk to Murad. Shehram, did you tell Baji about Chanda? How I can tell her. Don't tell her. Otherwise you will ruin your peaceful life. Stop thinking about Chanda, infact forget about her. I forgot her, but when I saw her at the wedding, the past came rushing back to me I just want to apologise her about the promise I made. I want to tell her how helpless I was There is no need of it or maybe she don't even remember you. A prostitute has a new man in her life every day They can't remember every single man. And what if you said sorry to her and she asked you, May I know you? How you will feel? Leave this Chanda topic now. What shall I do? I told you ....     Shumail, that's why I said No to you. But you did not listened to me once. I already know you can't bear all of this. I am a man, but I still know that women can't bear sharing Whatever happened was by your choice so now please, don't blame me.   Children are not born just by signing marriage papers Anyways, do what ever you want to do. You want to keep her or let her go, I have no issues. Murad, I am not saying this. I know you did this for my sake And I know that she is now your wife, unless she gives birth. We need her Then why are you crying? Because I am your wife and I love you very much. Just as children represent our helplessness, these tears also reflect my helplessness. Ignore my tears. For God's sake.... Don't do this. I get tense by seeing you in this condition. Already I am having headache. Do one thing .... Either change your behaviour or end this matter but please stop crying [Music] I couldn't sleep properly, I need some rest. Yes, I am sorry. Please don't cry. [Music] [Music]
