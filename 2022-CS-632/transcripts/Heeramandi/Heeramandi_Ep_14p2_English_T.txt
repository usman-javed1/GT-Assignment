[254.32] I also love Zeenat. If she dies, I will be sad
[262.76] but, if anything happens to you,
[269.96] my heart will burst. Promise me
[276.48] that you will fulfill all the promises you made to me. I have fulfilled all your promises
[283.20] Dress him up

[358.48] [Music]
[375.88] Why are you torturing yourself? I like that you are worried for me,
[381.48] but the way to get me out of trouble is not that you
[385.84] start thinking about marriage
[389.92] This is not your problem, but solution of my problem
[396.16] Are you mad? Neither am I mad, nor I am child, I can understand my good and bad.
[403.48] I know what will be the outcome of the decision. Now please don't say this
[408.32] because you are older than me, hence this marriage cannot happen.
[413.68] It's fine. I have not made any big promises of love to you, but I
[418.68] know this who is important for me and who is not
[421.72] You are very sensible Shehram, you understand things, that is why I expect
[428.32] you do not take any decision without thinking. Look,
[435.08] if you live in this world, you have to listen to the people of this world. 
[441.44] Then why are you afraid? I am not afraid of anyone, that's why I don't
[447.76] want to marry anyone out of fear. I know Shehram that I can't marry you.
[454.20] I respect your feelings. I admit that you have been useful to me in all my good and bad times,
[461.56] I also admit that I have got used to of you,
[466.16] maybe you too. But not marriage
[469.95] Look, if you say, I
[478.60] will not leave from here, I will stay here, and face everyone. Okay,
[484.12] when they see that there is nothing like this between us, then they will become quite them self.
[489.06] But you will not marry? No! Why?
[502.68] Am I this bad? Can't I support you?
[508.40] Can't I give you the happiness that is your right? Look at me, now tell me what
[516.00] is lacking in me? There is nothing lacking in you, you
[521.96] are very good, that is why I want you to marry a good girl. 
[526.92] Good girl? A good girl, is the one whose age is less than me. Whether she know me
[532.00] or not, our life after marriage is good or bad?
[536.56] You are very emotional, how can I explain to you this.

[710.40] These
[716.52] are tears of happiness,
[721.84] tell me why are you crying 
[727.04] Vodka,
[730.73]  I'm crying because
[737.48] why mother didn't get us married earlier
[741.50]  
[745.92] We are so unlucky,
[752.44] we make other's happy and kill our own happiness.
[758.64] I'm crying just because
[765.04] why didn't I listen to you earlier
[770.76] So what happened? Now you have accepted what's wrong now?
[782.12] What's the use now? Don't talk stupid. Do you know
[788.00] how happy I am today, don't see the benefit in everything,
[793.24] today you are my wife 
[797.80] Today I am very happy.
[803.76] The dream that I had seen years before has come true today,
[810.24] You have applied mehndi of my name on your hand, today you dressed up for me.
[816.96] Zeenat
[820.11] Yes.
[825.52] from today onwards I will be your wife,
[831.48] but I cannot become your wife. Hey, you have become my wife
[844.16] No Vodka, you only call me your wife.
[849.28] But I can't become,
[856.68] I don't want to kill you Vodka
[863.52] If you comes close to me, you will die 
[875.28] What are saying?
[879.04] I am right Vodka
[885.20] I can not become your wife 
[894.00] Because I
[899.84] have AIDS
