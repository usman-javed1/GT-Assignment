[2.32] Mom, it means Zarka will never be able to come here.
[7.11] Hey, I pray that she doesn't come here. 
[11.04] What are you saying? Why wouldn’t she come here?
[14.80] You don't know Pari, I am a mother
[18.96] I wasn't even a courtesan.
[26.20] I came from a good family. I had already spoiled my own soil
[33.44] it would have been better
[40.44] if I had married and given birth to you how nice it would have been.
[44.96] now Allah has found a way, my daughter is married
[51.64] I pray that she never comes back, I think for you too,
[59.40] May I find a good place for you to get married. May Allah grant you good fortune.
[67.68] Let it be, Mom. You didn’t marry her;  you have sold her 
[72.20] Those who are keeping her confined today will be the same ones after the child is born will
[77.64] send her back home. Oh, don’t say such things. Don’t do that.
[85.12] May her child does not born too soon.
[89.52] Oh Allah, perform such a miracle that my daughter does not come here.
[97.48] Alright, now you go, all the household work is pending.
[102.04] Go and make tea for me. I have a headache so I can take some medicine.
[106.36] I am feeling hungry.
[108.08] Let me eat first. You didn’t let me eat there. Take tea later.
[114.20] Alright, let’s just eat. But you listen to me.
[119.08] Don’t worry about her not coming over here.
[123.60] They are decent people.
[125.36] That boy has gotten married.
[128.92] Does anyone send their wife to a brothel?
[133.28] Just don't give me a headache by talking like this anymore.
[139.48] If we want, we can go meet her. Have they stopped us?
[146.28] What good people they are.
[148.80] Alright, go and bring the food.
[160.68] [Song]
[174.32] leave this,Today, I’ve brought good food from a big hotel.
[178.64] Move this food.
[180.96] I will not eat a bite with your earnings.
[185.64] This is disgraceful earnings.
[186.92] And what you have been eating your entire life.
[188.72] By bringing customers and taking commissions.
[190.76] That was not unlawful earnings? That was not disgraceful earnings?
[194.08] Look, I’m telling you old man. Don’t be clever with me. You all are ungrateful.
[200.92] I got her married, didn't book her for one night.
[205.08] Hey, have some shame. Be ashamed.
[208.80] If you had married Zarka, she would have been serving your mother.
[214.00] Oh, you are enough to serve her. Whenever she cries, just keep wiping her tears.
[222.80] I feel a lot of regret, Guddu.
[227.72] You should have died at birth.
[230.80] It would have been better if I had died at your birth.
[233.92] It would have been better if I had died at birth.
[237.96] If I hadn’t been born, who would have deposited 3 lakh in Mom's account?
[241.60] Have you ever seen 3 lakh in your life?
[244.56] Guddu, just get up and go away. I don’t want to eat your food.
[251.68] Go to hell, Guddu. Alright, alright, I'm leaving.
[255.44] If you don’t want to eat, then don’t. Why are you throwing a tantrum? At least think about your age.
[272.12] Hey, what a lentil you have cooked, you could have learned something from Zarka
[283.56] Stop eating lentils and rice. Here, I’ve brought chicken for you all, from a big hotel.
[287.32] You probably have never tasted such food in your life. I guarantee it. We don’t want to eat, take it back.
[293.24] And tell me, what deal you made about Zarka?
[296.84] that she will never come here? What does that mean?
[300.92] Oh, didn’t Zarka come? Auntie, you went to bring her.
[303.92] Pari, I had told you not to fuss or make a scene.
[307.48] Tell the whole story; why didn’t they send her?
[309.96] That's why you made a deal. Oh come on, I didn’t make any such deal.
[313.76]  How we can break relationship with her?
[315.92] Whiskey, listen to me and let her blabber. They are absolutely right. 
[321.12] The deal was that they would take her after marriage
[323.92] and send her back after having child?
[326.44] Does any decent man send his wife to a brothel? Auntie
[331.20] I won’t allow any such thing to happen.
[333.36] We didn't give her away forever.
[335.12] And neither we will break our relationship with her.
[338.12] Even their father will send her.
[339.64] I will go bring her back. Let’s see who stops me. Hey, listen to me.
[344.00] You are not going there, understand?
[356.64] I’ve fallen into such a difficult situation. Everyone's mind is messed up. They didn’t let Zarka come.
[363.84] I was just about to go there, but Auntie stopped me.
[368.60] No, Whiskey.
[371.12] Just see, they won’t send Zarka.
[374.44] And you don’t need to go there either. Why no need? She didn't went there forever.
[382.92] Alright, forget it.
[385.04] I don’t understand. What will you and Auntie earn, and what will you eat?
[389.20] The brothel has been abandoned. Now it’s just you and Pari left. Why don’t you start dancing and singing?
[394.16] I can do it. And you know, I’ve learned to dance too.
[398.48] Now that’s the spirit! And see, there’s nothing wrong with it. Think,
[402.92] Neither Lafrah have any work nor do I have any. 
[405.20] I still drive a rickshaw, but poor Lafrah.
[409.84] And, I did get Zarka's money in my share, didn’t I?
[412.56] Poor Lafda is sitting at his betel shop, but there’s no one to buy from him.
[416.68] You know, Whisky, Mom had saved some money.
[420.16] Now that’s about to run out too. But who will explain this to Mom?
[423.80] My mom is no less than your mom. I will say to Lafrah.
[429.80] He will convince to both of them.
[433.36] Alright, Whisky. Tell me one thing. Speak honestly. What?
[439.60] Zarka used to say, 
[442.28] You loved her and wanted to marry her too.
[446.60] So then what happened? Oh, it’s not like that.
[449.84] I neither loved her nor wanted to marry her. I hate the name of marriage.
[455.48] People deceive with the name of marriage.
[458.84] My father did the same thing.
[461.28] I swear, the day I meet that guy, I will hit him.
[466.52] I feel like God created me to take revenge for my mother.
[469.92] I will kill him the day I find him.
[472.96] Okay, kill him when you find him. Don't get angry now.
[479.56] I'm feeling hungry again, please feed me something.
[483.40] I'm tired of feeding you since morning, how much do you eat? 
[503.60] What I want to talk to you about now...
[507.28] Promise me.
[509.40] You won’t tell anyone.
[511.68] Chanda, you don't trust me? Tell me, what's the matter?
[523.16] I went to Zarka's in-laws' place.
[526.68] I saw Guddu's father. What?
[530.24] Which one was he? Why didn’t you tell me? How should I tell?
[534.68] That's why I left from there. I've been worried since then.
[540.20] Why was he at Zarka's in-laws' place?
[544.56] That's why I didn't go to Zarka with Hema.
[547.60] So you should have asked Zarka. I just told you
[551.68] I don’t want anyone to find out. How can I ask Zarka?
[556.56] And even if I ask, what am I supposed to do?
[559.96] I'm already hurt anyway.
[562.52] Chanda, it would have been better if you had met him.
[566.16] He might still remember you even today.
[569.16] If he remembered me, he wouldn't have come here?
[573.96] He must have seen me too. He must have figured it out.
[579.56] That I am someone related to Zarka. He might have even asked Zarka about you?
[586.32] No, if he had asked, Zarka would have told me.
[592.02] Anyway, who remembers a prostitute?
[598.32] He came here at the insistence of friends.
[601.84] He must have left because of his family's threats
[606.61] You are right. But you could have told him; he has a son with you.
[614.12] What should I tell him? That his child is a broker?    
[618.12] Who brings customers for the prostitutes?
[621.04] He smokes weed and is lost in a life of aimlessness.
[624.44] He even sold his fiancee. What should I tell him?
[629.28] Won't it hurt him to hear all this?
[633.00] I don't know whether he will accept Guddu or not.
[637.88] He is a respectable man, he have respectable children 
[642.71] They must be studying in good colleges.
[647.56] If he accept's Guddu then
[651.26] Will he take him to his home?
[654.71] Chanda, why didn't you tried to send Guddu to him when he was young?
[660.58] I tried very hard.
[664.95] I searched for him a lot. But Guddu and I have really bad luck
[670.76] He never showed up. I never found him.
[678.22] Listen, Neelam. Talking to you has lightened my heart.
[684.71] If you ever meet Zarka, even by mistake, don’t let this conversation slip out.
[692.39] What are you saying? Don't worry; it will never happen. You don’t need to stress.
[701.42] Alright, Don't think too much.
[704.32] Alright, you should sleep. Rani is also alone in the room.
[707.72] I'll go check on her. Alright, don’t think too much. Just sleep.
[730.40]  
[747.16] [TV Sound]
[807.96] [Music]
[872.20] You are drinking tea on an empty stomach, it is not good for health.
[882.86] It is my habit since childhood.
[888.22] I'll make breakfast for you. No, no need.
[898.72] I woke up early because I had to go to the office. Come, sit down.
[902.28]  Shumail sister, Shall I make breakfast for you?
[906.16] No, I don’t want to have breakfast.
[912.00] Shumail, listen.
[921.38] Shumail,
[924.76] Shumail, listen to me. Shumail
[933.00] What happened to you? 
[934.40] Is something wrong with me, or is something wrong with you?
[937.40] Why are you behaving this way with me?
[940.05] Should I regret what I've done, Murad? Tell me.
[944.08] I did all this because we both needed a child.So what am I doing?
[951.46] You are doing what’s in your heart.
[954.00] You are doing something, Murad, that I never expected. After all, you are a man.
[957.71] Otherwise, why do you sneak into her room at night?
[961.72] Stop talking nonsense.
[963.34] That's why I said no to you. It's my mistake Now I'm regretting it.
[969.60] I told you that you would regret it, but you didn’t listen to me.
[974.42] And even now, I'm not doing anything.
[976.92] Neither I bring that woman into this house, you bring her.
[981.32] I don't want a child.
[983.52] I don’t want a child. I really don’t want
