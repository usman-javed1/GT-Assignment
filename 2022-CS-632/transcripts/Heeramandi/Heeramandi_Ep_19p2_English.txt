[Music] It's looking beautiful on you. I have brought you as per my choice, Hi Whiskey, how much do you care about my likes and dislikes. Who else's happiness will I take care of? Mother does not talk to me Pari is not my friend and Lafrah is also like my mother. Then only you are left. Whisky, can I say something? Don't bring customers for me. I want to dance only for you. Don't say such things, this is our business. If we don't do this, then how we will survive? This area is already empty, only you Pari are left. You won't dance than how we will earn? Whiskey, why don't you do some other work? You drive a rickshaw, You just pick up the passengers and take them to their destination. And if you make them sit, then at least not for me.  Listen to me, let's get married and go somewhere far away from here. Oh wow, if we get married and go away, no one will be able to find us. No, you are crazy, I have no intention of marriage and tell me one thing that if we get married, what will happen to Mother? Where Hema Aunty and Pari will go?I  don't want to marry right now. It means you don't love me. Why do you bring love in between? Look, I love you, I don't want to get married Okay ... I will think about it! [Music] Crazy! Zarka ... Hey Zarka,  You haven't eaten anything since morning, eat something if you say, I will bring food here. No Mother, I am not hungry, you go, I will eat myself [Music] She is not ready? She is absolutely ready, see how beautiful she is looking. Mashallah, looking very pretty. Where are Rani and Pari? They are not ready yet? They are ready, I am sending them to you, you also get ready. Can I ask you one thing? Yes You are getting your husband married, don't you feel bad? You must also know very well that any woman can't tolerate any other woman with her husband.  But the biggest problem of us is Child! My husband has absolutely no interest in second marriage. When aunty told him that if he wants to see you or want to meet you, then he can do so, he flatly refused and said that he is doing this only because of me because I want a child. God has deprived me of the blessing of a child, otherwise this situation would have never occurred. Are you doing all this because you love your husband very much? My husband does not want to do all this at all because he loves me very much, he is doing all this only because of my wish, do not forget one thing that we are doing this marriage only for the child and that too  because I forced him. You will not have any relation with him, I mean there can be any relation, maybe he never talk to you and yes, as soon as we will know that you are expecting, you will be paid more and inshallah when the child  is delivered, we will clear all your payments but yes after that we will never have any relation with you. Don't worry, I know that I will not have any relation with you all You people want child from me and I want money from you people, that's all By the way there was no relationship in courtesan's life.   My daughters kept yearning for relationships all their life, all the relationships were present, auntie uncle, everyone is present but their hard luck now this relationship, this is also for few days. What if Whisky would have married Zarka! Hema, there is no use of crying now and anyway, it was Zarka's decision. Zarka took this decision because Whiskey had humiliated her and refused to marry her, I had been expecting for a long time when she will become Whisky's bride I have been telling you for a long time that he doesn't want this. My heart is worried, I will return their money, I will bring my daughter back. This is not the time to talk non sense. Look Madam is sending the car and it's about to arrive. Get up, get ready, Zarka is waiting for us there Hema, there is no use of these things, and listen, even after going there, don't talk like that Come on, get up! I don't know when my Zarka will return whether she will come back, whether she will live or die but I will never forgive Whisky for this [Music]   [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]  [music] sit  Zarka, sometimes life puts woman in a difficult exam Only I know the pain of handing over my husband to another woman. Do you understand? He will be your husband just for one night, My God knows what I am going through and I hope my God will take me out of this situation, I can only pray    When I earn a lot of money then I will marry you and you know, I will decorate room in such a way that you will hide in the flowers, nobody will know which one are flowers and where are you. When will you take me to the seashore? Why do you want to die by drowning? Yes, with you. You will go and taking me too. I am saying this, because my birthday is coming. Your birthday is coming, so what should I do? Let's do one work, I will show you a good film. We will go to the cinema. Yes yes, let's go, Which movie we will watch? I don't even know which film to watch. Any love story we will watch. That's why, I say you are so spoiled. Don't watch such movies, keep distance with me, you are spoiling me too. I watch it only because of you, why because of me? I will marry you, you are my fiancee. If you said once again, I will jump from here. Then jump [music] [music]
