[Music] By hiding your feelings, you think you will fool me? I know that you are in pain, I am happy very happy Murad. Don't lie to me, no woman in the world can be happy after getting her husband married. I wanted to save you and myself from this agony You are with me Murad. You will not let anything happen to me, you will save me, nor you will drown, nor you will let me drown, When God has not planned a child for us,  then by doing all this, you are displeasing Allah, I am very afraid of this. I pray for this all night long. I remain in prostration all night.  remind him that he has said, keep trying, I will give you success. We will try Murad. It's not a try, this is a fight with God, look, we still have time, we can send her back, we send her back, give her the money, do whatever you have to do, send her back. No, Murad You have done so much for me, don't step back now.   I didn't want to do all this. For my sake! [Music] I also make a promise to you, this woman is in this house only because of you, you send her back any day you want, I won't say anything. Shumail... Go, she is waiting for you. Nothing will happen to your heart?  You won't even stop me? No Go! [Music] Go.... Go now   [Crying] You are very beautiful! Shumail had told me to see you first before marriage but I refused. Because I had nothing to do with all these things [Music] But today I am surprised that Shumail liked such a beautiful girl for me Your eyes speaks If you don't say anything but I understood everything [Music] Why did I buy this ring, I don't even know Even Shumail doesn't know about it, so how can I know, just like this, buy it secretly for you. May I? Mother says that a man is of raw feelings. Your mother is right. Earlier I did not want to come in this room and now my heart does not want me to to go out of this room ever. Murad .... Where are you going, Shumail? You yourself have sent him there, now will you stop him? Whatever you have done, now you will have to be patient on this, you have to tolerate everything [Music]  Chande Chande, what is wrong? You have not said a thing since you came back from wedding. Why are you quite? What happened? Why are you troubling Chande? Say something, what happened? Listen, you are sad because Zarka did'nt become your daughter in Law? Is this the reason? Zarka, have not become your daughter in law, that's why you are crying? What's the matter? Yes Maybe that's why. I am a woman, I can understand other woman feelings, I had seen love for Guddu in Zarka's eyes. and today  Today in her husband's first wife, I saw restlessness in her eyes.   Why don't only women have to bear all the sorrows in this world? Don't talk like this even a man also suffers, everyone gets sorrows. You are crying for the sake of your child, it's useless to cry over this all. He is insensitive person. He doesn't care about anyone. He is mean. Your son is just like his father. Yes, he is just like his father, Then don't cry for him. When you cry, my heart burst. Leave this, I will get nice tea for you. When you cries like this, something happens to me.  Come on now, Smile! I am bringing tea for you. [Music]  [Music] [Music] If there is still a good girl in you, then it is my duty to take you out of this filth and take you to my home.  Will you wait for me? It will take me few days to come back to you. I will talk to my parents and then take you. Trust me, I will definitely come. Sir, are you sure that you will come back? Yes, I am sure of it, You will not forget me? No ... I will wait for you. Just remember that a girl named Chanda  will be waiting for you, neither will she sleep nor will she die [music] She loves you very much, Whiskey. I don't love her. You don't feel sad? Sad for what? About Zarka's marriage. I am happy, a courtesan got married because of me, what else do you need and anyway, she and her mother got Rupees 10 lakhs, I did not get anything through the contract. Zarka says that you have sold her. Tell me one thing, I had refused, I had told Madam to select some other girl, She had come to talk to you, Zarka herself got ready, but why do you all blame me for everything? Okay, leave this. Tell me Whisky, have you ever fallen in love with anyone? Thank God I have never been in love. What if you fall in love?   Then I don't know, but Lafrah is right. The life of a pimp and prostitute is same, neither do they ever get married nor do they fall in love. Come on, let's go home, I am feeling very sleepy Mother, why are you sad? You should be happy. You gave your daughter away as a bride and this is what you wanted, isn't it? I am not sad because I made her a bride and left. I am sad because one day she will get divorce and she will also come back. Mother, this is bound to happen, now there is no need to be sad about it, see, everything will be fine when she comes back We will leave this place and will get her married at some other better place and in the new place where  we will shift, no one will even know who we are and where we have come from. You are right Pari. When Zarka will come back we will leave this house, then I will get both of you married at a good place. So mother, stop being sad, leave everything to God, He knows all our sorrows and all our compulsions.  Mother, we will go to Zarka's place tomorrow? Yes, we will go. Mother, I will also go with you, we will bring Zarka here as well. Mother, all girls visits there parents house next day of their wedding? Come on, let's go to sleep. What if we couldn't wake up on time. Let me just clean up this all. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
