[Music] Shumail She is sleeping. Where were you? I was in the drawing room. Why there? Come upstairs, let’s talk. Close the door. So, you... Were sleeping on the sofa all night? What was I supposed to do? I came, but your door was locked. You must have been asleep. No, no, Murad. I was not asleep. You should have knocked. I knocked. But I thought you were in a deep sleep. Then I went downstairs and slept. I'm sorry. I might have locked it absentmindedly. Murad. Actually, When you .... went in Zarka's room. Why did you bring juice? You know, I take tea in the morning. I am having a sore throat.   I'll bring tea for you. You can drink juice.
No, I won't drink it. You took the helpers out. Who will take care of the house, breakfast, and water?  I'll make breakfast, don't worry. You know that It was necessary to let all servants go. I don't want them to...  find out about your and Zarka's relationship. You know what I mean.  You understand, right?  Murad, now... How is Zarka? I mean, you... I mean, you and her... Shumail Hello!  Walikum salam. I don't know. I mean, hold on. It's Zarka's sister on the phone. Take to Zarka. [Music] Zarka. Zarka. Hello. She is in the washroom. So, please hold. Yes, sister, you were saying something. It's your sister's phone.  She was calling on your mobile, it’s probably off. Yes, I turned it off. Yes, Pari, speak. Yes, I turned my phone off last night. I just didn’t feel like talking to anyone, that's why. Who? Yes, he is nice. Really nice. That's enough for me. Yes, and... You tell me, how is Mother? Look, Shumail, now it's not the time to think or understand.  I agree, it's not easy to tolerate other woman. But to gain something, you have to lose something. Now don't worry just be strong. I just can't be strong anymore. I've done enough of that. This is the first time I was alone in my bedroom like this. And this thought is driving me crazy—that Murad is with someone else in the other bedroom. I wanted to... make noise and break everything around me. I wanted to break down her room's door and pull him back. Don't even think like that, Shumail. Don't bring such thoughts in your mind, or you'll lose Murad. Seriously, right now you need a lot of strength, my dear. Don't let them know that you have any problems. Be very nice to both Zarka and Murad.  Otherwise, everything you've done will go to waste, and you won't achieve your goals despite all your hard work. Sheram is having breakfast. When he leave's for the office, I'll ask him to drop me at your place. Please come up! [Music] Shumail is getting worried. Yes, Sheram. She is worried I'm amazed on her strength. How can a woman share her husband with someone else? She did all this for the sake of the child, right?  Now she should be able to endure it. Or she shouldn't have done any of this. I told her the same thing—that fighting against fate is wrong. Sheram   Please drop me at her house on your way to the office. Okay, I will drop you. [Song] Oh, wow You look like a hero!  It's good you came! Mother and I are going to Zarka's place. If you’re coming, let me know. No, I don't want I'm going out to have fun today. I'm going to places I've never been before. "And I'm going to eat at places I've never eaten from before." I'll eat to my heart's content. Come along with me!  I know you must have collected 50 thousand. That’s what's bouncing around in your pocket! I’ve never seen that much money before! And I don’t like saving money. If God is giving, then make use of it. If you save some money, it will come in handy for you. Okay, let me know if you are coming with us! I thought if you are coming, we can go together in your rickshaw. Okay! I understand everything. One minute, Auntie I know how selfish you are; that's why you're saying to go with me in my rickshaw for free. Hey! Don't be too cheeky. Just take the fare! No need for that; there are plenty of taxis and rickshaws in the market.  Hey, Auntie! I think you're still upset with me. I'm telling you, you're not being grateful. Look, don’t start again. My head is getting messed up. Just get out of here and go enjoy yourself. I'm going to have fun. I just came to ask how Zarka is.  Pari, you ask her on my behalf. She's happy in her home. I talked to her on the phone. I'll ask you all after a year. We’ll pray that she stays happy. He messed with my head. Now what are you doing? Hurry up! Mother, Pari, and Hema Auntie are going to Zarka's house. Can I go to? No, dear. There's no need for that. Mother, let me go. I don't think Chanda will go either. No one is going, just sit at home and relax.   Everything has gone to waste. If you do good, there's trouble; if you don't, there's still trouble. What happened? Neelam Auntie, Hema Auntie deposited half million. She went with me to the bank. And then she treated me like I am her biggest enemy. Anyway, forget about those people. It’s just a matter of two days; then things will get better on their own. Okay, I'm going out to have fun. Are you guys coming with me?  No, dear. I'm not of an age to go out and have fun. I'm going to Chanda. Rani has been insisting since morning to go, take her. I'm going to Chanda's. Thank you, Mother. You're great. I'll be back! Hey, where are you taking me? I'm taking you to the beach. We will eat gol gappas! I’ll take you to a big hotel and will eat there. Enjoy yourself with Whisky. Seriously! I swear on you. Okay, I'll get ready right now. You're already looking good! I'll go in these clothes. You're crazy! I am coming in a short while. [ Song ]  Chanda, what's the matter? You seem really worried since last night. You seem more upset than Hema on Zarka's wedding. You quietly left during the wedding ceremony too. And since you came, you've been worried. What's the matter? Neelum. Those wounds that hurt us years ago... with the time the pain lessens, and we feel as if all wounds have healed. Than small happiness reopens those wounds again. I have no sorrow over Zarka's wedding. Actually, I'm happy about it. That she didn’t marry Guddu. What would he have given her? At least she would be happy there for a year, right? Until the time came for divorce I just want that time never comes. In fact, I pray that God doesn’t give her child so soon. That she has to come back here after getting a divorce. What do you think? If there’s a delay in having a child, will they still keep her there?  God forbid. If they send her back even then... That's exactly what I'm praying for. That she doesn't have to come back here at all. Okay, Chanda. You didn’t tell me, which wound is reopen? Leave it, what will you do knowing that? I know you’ll never tell me. Come on, get up. Let’s have breakfast. Rani already had breakfast. I was waiting for you. Come on!  Hey, Chanda!  Chanda, I'm going to Zarka's house. Are you coming with me? How she will go? She is having fever since last night. Has she taken her medicine? Yes, I have taken the pill will feel better soon. Give my love to her. I'll definitely give, but you take care of yourself too. Okay, then I’m off!  Hema, I’m making tea, drink it then go. Oh, just forget it. It's already late, I needed to reach there quickly. Okay, Allah Hafiz! Alright, I'll make tea for you. Just sit back and relax. [Music] Yes, Zahid. I left home to go to the office, but I just don't feel like going. Don't worry, I'll come over, man. If I manage to control heart, then I will come, Alright! This is her third cup of tea since morning and hasn’t had breakfast yet. Why, Shumail? What happened? If I don't feel like it, then why should I force myself to eat? There are many things that a person may not feel like doing. But sometimes, you have to force yourself to do them. Then just refuse.  What are you saying, Shumail? Whatever has happened, it was for your happiness. I know. Where is Zarka? She didn’t come for breakfast. I sent breakfast to her room. Is it really necessary for her to sit with us here for breakfast?  I don’t want her to share everything with me. Or try to compare herself to me. What things won’t you share?  May I have breakfast here? I'm not used to eating alone, and...   I couldn't eat, so I thought I’d come here. I was asking about you. Come and Sit down! How are you?  
I'm fine. Sister, my mother and sister are coming today.  I was thinking of going home with them and then... he can come to pick me up in the evening. No, he won't come to pick you up from that area. [Music]
