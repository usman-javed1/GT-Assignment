Call her! I am calling, it's ringing, no one is picking up Habib, I am not able to understand one thing that if Murad has really divorced Zarka then why did he or his wife not tell us. They should have told us. Call her again. I am calling her. Have some patience [Music] [Music] For God's sake, don't divorce me, I will not go anywhere else I will stay with you only. I will serve you, I made a mistake, forgive me. Stop your nonsense, you are divorced. No sister, I will not go, I will stay with you. Your father will also go. Murad tell the driver, it is morning, so now drop her back. Go away! What are you doing? Have you gone mad? Yes, I have gone mad, tell the driver to take  this filth in the same place from where we brought it. No, for God's sake. What are you doing? What am I doing?  She is a drama. Murad, just shut up now! We have to take her to the doctor. Listen, if anything happens to her, it will be very bad for you too. What is wrong with you Murad? What happened to you? Take care of yourself [Music] It's Okay ... Relax [Music] Open the door. I will also come with you. Open gate Quickly.... [Music] Lafray, you come with me, what those bastards think about themself?  You keep quiet quite.  Hema, drink a glass of water. Are you waiting for her to die? Tell me what happened? I am telling you, if he even touches Zarka, I will break his hands and feet Hema Aunty, you come with me, we will bring her back, I will account for every penny. If they pay me the full amount, then I will bring her. You come with me. Habib, I had told you earlier to tell him not to come here. Why is he stepping inside my house? Look, I am standing outside your house, I am not inside. If you won't keep quiet then I will hit you hard. Keep quiet. Chanda, he is right. I will go with Lafrah and check what is happening there. Hema, be patient, right now we don't know what has happened there. I don't know why Zarka has called. Maybe husband and wife had some small dispute? Yes Hema, Chanda is right. If such a thing had happened, then Murad or his wife or the woman who had arranged the relationship would have called. You have patience. Yes, yes, be patient, even if they kill her. You keep quiet. I am telling you, if you guys don't go, I will go and get her. Habib, tell him, if he goes there, I will kill him. Okay, that's it. Pari, call her. I am calling her. she is not picking up. O Habib, why are you listening to women? Come with me. Are you going or shall I hit you? Hey, I got hurt! How can I be patient, he is right. Oh Hema, have a little more patience, maybe when you go there, there is nothing that you are talking about. Hey Pari, come here, Give me phone. I don't know whom she has been calling for the last two hours. You can see now? Keep quiet, How to use it? Let her do it. Pari you dial number. Please stop, no need of injection, her blood pressure has become very low. Due to which she has become unconscious, you stay with her, I will come right away Yes Doctor. What happened to her? She suddenly fell while standing. She is your? She is my wife! How is she now? By the way It's normal, everything is fine, just the blood pressure had gone down and it happens in such a situation, you should take great care of her, is this your first child? What? I don't have any children. Then I should congratulate you. Congratulations, you are going to be a father   [Music] Sheram! Take tea, I am preparing breakfast for you. No, I will not have breakfast, I have to go early, I have some important work. Hello, everything okay, why are you calling early in the morning? Really? Excellent! This is a very good news, yes yes, congratulations, you all are at home, yes, I am definitely coming, okay. Zarka is pregnant! Can you drop me there while going to the office? Yes sure, you get ready, Okay! Hey Guddu. Listen to me, I am coming with you, but do not create mess there. I have already said it, if it turns out to be true and Zarka is not paid in full, I will not leave them. Hey, you will not do anything, what I am saying to you? I will talk. I know how to deal with them. You will talk like this? Hey, what else should I do, wear bangles in hands? Come Make me sit. Oh Old man, after the operation, you have become more dependable Thank God, I am saved. Guddu, drive carefully Be careful, Drive slow You have divorced me? There has been no divorce and I will not do it again. You have said it thrice. Yes, I have definitely said it. But look, a woman who is about to become a mother does not get a divorce. Okay, and I will not do this again Please do not take tension. When I will have a child, she will forcibly get me divorced, I don't want divorce She won't do this. I agree that she is a little angry, she is emotional, she talks, she fights, but please forgive her, What else can I do, but what had I done. You haven't done anything, it is my fault, Why did it become your fault to come to me? Please forget all these things and just take care of yourself, I am sure, she will not quarrel with you now. Will not cause any problem to you. Tell me, did you eat something, Shall bring anything for you. I am not hungry, Zarka, even if you are not hungry, you still have to eat something, okay? Forcefully! And I have said for the maid too. She will take care of you and you don't need to do household chores. Okay don't worry, I'll bring you something. You haven't eaten anything since last night  [Music]  Shumail .... Congratulations! You should'nt have fought with Murad. Thanks to Allah, you just have to be patient for nine more months. You have to take care of Zarka because you want a healthy child. Where is Zarka? In her room. Where are you going? She is not alone, she is with Murad You are crying in happiness or ...  I don't know whether I am are crying in happiness or sadness, I just know that I should not have done what I did. Murad had also told me that he would never leave me under any circumstances. What is the need to make a scene, We all explained it to you, but you only obeyed your friend, but now it's okay, your purpose has been fulfilled, now you should be happy, it's just a matter of nine months, now Murad also don't have to go to her, but you should take care of her. Shumail is very stupid Thank God that nothing happened to that girl. If something wrong had to her, then both of you would have been in trouble. I too had the same fear. Shumail did not do well. When I took her to the hospital, then I came to know that she is pregnant [music]  Now this story has started, how will Shumail tolerate it? She have to do this because I can't tolerate any more misbehavior of Shumail, Obviously in this condition you can't leave her.    Why don't you talk to your mrs about it I mean if she talk to Shumail then ... No Murad, I think you should. If I say it won't sound good. [Music] Okay I will talk to her. Infact I have to talk to Shumail too. Sir, some people came from Madam Zarka's house. Send them inside. Did you tell her family or not? No, maybe Zarka called. Okay Murad I have to go. Sit for a while, have some tea etc. I'm fine, there is some important work, let's meet in the evening.    Please have a seat. What's the matter sir, if you have given divorce, then settle the score, and return the girl. Hey, shut up! Please sit. Thank you Sir! [Music] Sir, Zarka's called us, she says for Godbiden, if you have divorced her. So you all have come to take her? Definately Sir, now there is no reason for her to stay here. The deal was that ... She will not go anywhere from here. What do you mean? You will forcefully stop her? Oh, you keep quiet, let me talk. My point is that if you have divorced her ... I have not divorced her. Zarka is mad that she called us at midnight, you call Zarka, in what condition she is what happened to her, we will ask her. I am telling you sir, is there even the slightest mistake I won't let her stay here. Don't misbehave. No one said anything to her, that's why she won't go anywhere. But Sir, what's the matter? She is going to be a mother. Really? Sir, is this true? Why will I lie to you? You are lying sir! If she is going to have a child then why did she call, why did she say that you are divorcing her? I will call Zarka, ask yourself. Can't you shut up, just talking rubbish. Do you understand what he means? Zarka's is expecting, now she will not leave from here, Just shut up, we have come here to take Zarka and listen, even if a child is being born. Don't worry, we will get abort. You just somehow convince Zarka that she will go with us, we won't leave her here.
