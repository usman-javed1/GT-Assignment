[0.24] Today I have sent Vatka to get customers. He brings very good and strong customers who are
[6.24] not even poor. Champa will eat you. She says
[12.04] that Vatka brings customers only for us. Oh wow, what has Vatka bought,
[17.08] he has given commission. She gives it, we will also give it, okay tell me for how long will Hema
[24.24] remain angry with Champa, I will not talk to her for the rest of my life, I am not going to forgive even if I die,
[31.72] and Zeenat, do you keep taking the name of that wretched person again and again, okay leave it in front of me,
[37.40] tell me. What are you wearing today? You have to prepare well today. A
[43.60] very strong customer is coming. He is coming with Vatka.
[48.40] Akh ladi bad badi
[56.03] [Music]
[101.40] Excuse: You are a shameless unemployed person by giving a job and doing shamelessness here.
[108.60] The name of the family is Ti, you are a child. Leave it to me girl, who are you and get out of here, leave
[114.48] me in such a disrespect, why didn't you come to ask me whether
[119.88] I am alive or not, keep quiet, don't talk nonsense, who is he,
[126.04] he is my uncle's son, he is my relative, look at his face, he is mine.
[130.96] Relatives are like this, relatives are like this, after the death of our parents, they did
[137.92] not even look back at us. I and my sister and brother remained hungry for a whole week, kept dying, where did they go then,
[145.48] so much disrespect, then they talk nonsense while sitting in the kitchen, you don't even feel ashamed. I am ashamed,
[151.80] not this, you should be ashamed. Today, when the disgrace of this family is visible, it
[157.12] was not visible when these people were thrown on the streets and dying. Come on, get out of here, this is not your house
[162.52] of nobles, where they raise hands on women. If I touch this girl here, I
[167.44] will break her hands and legs and put them in my pocket. Come on, get away from here, I could not even imagine that you
[173.28] can be so disrespectful, Rihanna. Hey, go, you have come to do a very good deed. Keep quiet here,
[179.28] now if you step there or else I
[183.20] will kill you, I died for you and you for us, you
[189.72] were already dead for us and from today your brothers and sisters also died for you and I will tell you, Abba. I will go and tell you, oh
[196.36] Amma, talk to Lafe and call him, we will get him out by hitting him. Bhai Garat Bhai,
[203.08] I cannot give the remaining two rotis, but because of the risk, he has come to kick
[207.28] me. Hey, why are you crying, Hima, just tell me about this. I was afraid, how did I know
[214.96] that this man would come to this place, uncle, I am not afraid of him,
[220.04] he will not let Sultana Gagar meet me, who is Sultana, she
[227.04] is my sister, with whom I have left my brothers and sisters, sister me. Oh, I won't let him see his face
[232.48] [laughter]
[236.00] Why didn't you tell me, my friend, I would have taken out his wick-like arm and given him ashes.
[241.52] Oh go, both of them were amazing and died. Hosana brother, I had taken the child with me
[246.76] and you were crying. Oh! Listen, you should have stopped him here, oh
[251.40] why didn't you stop here, he is doing wonders here, friend, you were a customer, I was a customer, oh you
[256.32] should have given a call to Phoolan Phoolan, ok ok let's go and get buried, by the way,
[262.32] where is this Hema, she has been awake the whole night. Sister has been crying remembering her brothers, she is sleeping now,
[268.64] I don't feel like waking her up and it is good, uncle has taken the sister, he
[274.08] will get the brothers, you yourself will come to know what cradle is, Hema lost her life. As long as
[279.32] the customer is here, you guys stay downstairs, there is no need to take Guddu to the shell.
[284.12] Oh, I had taken Guddu to the shell so that when Chanda dances, he will cry. Oh
[289.04] no, if you take him, you will sit in front and watch. By the way, where is brother Chada, she
[295.52] is also awake with Hima all night, she is sleeping, just listen brother, I came to tell you
[301.52] that Imtiaz Sahab has given a useful gift, his
[307.52] daughter has got off, Kach Pup Kach Pup, how did you know that he is gone? I was with Imtiaz Ali Khan and he said,
[315.44] SHO, take care of us all, we will take care of everyone, now you
[321.52] have told me very good news, see, I did not say this but I used to stay awake the whole night in trouble, oh
[327.04] that you are worried about your mother. You trapped me, otherwise it was
[330.20] good news, so I had come to give you all, now you all rest comfortably, ok then let
[337.20] 's go, let's go, Raab Rakha
[345.72] [Music]
[354.27] [Praise]
[360.11] [Music]
[370.48] Hey Champa, you haven't eaten Amma's bread yet. The branch has come, otherwise it will break your face.
[377.08] And what is this? Why have you taken out my clothes? Will you wear them in the evening? I will iron them.
[384.12] Good, big love is coming on me. This is a very precious pair of mine.
[390.16] Keep it with dignity. Beware of anyone who touches you. And I went and made Amma's roti and became a great queen.
[394.92] Yes, I will make it [Music]
[432.32] What happened to you [Music]
[434.96] It is better if I die so that I will be spared from these tortures,
[439.84] I thought, Chanda, if this is what I have to do, then I have to stay here. Let it happen, I
[447.64] pray to Allah that you are a daughter, why do you talk like this, you also
[453.96] have a family, go to them and they will accept you, my love Chanda, they will not accept me.
[460.20] You will do it, you don't know them anyway, what will I do by going there, hey, who will
[467.12] marry me, I have just decided that since I have to stay here, this is what I have to do, then let it happen, my child will also grow up
[475.72] like Guddu
[480.09] [Music]
[483.60] Why have you all come here? If Champa wants
[488.20] to make friends with you, will you force me? Yes, no, he himself has said that he
[496.04] should make friends with you [Music]
[500.16] Do it, it was my mistake, I know, forgive
[506.96] me, I am sorry. Come on, Ma, she is apologizing. End that conversation and hug me,
[517.88] let 's
[522.72] go, I consider you like my sister, I have always
[529.88] considered you my sister, that is why I am saying, please forgive me,
[537.20] come with me,
[544.44] now I don't know what has happened to you, Chachanda, my heart is very heavy today. It is full of Hema, that and there
[555.60] was a song that we used to sing, so tell us which
[562.20] one today, if we miss the party, don't
[573.40] cry if we miss the party, if we miss the party, don't cry, you console the heart.
[588.80] Don't ever get scared, don't
[596.24] cry, we are leaving the party
[642.89] [Music]
[663.84] [Music]
[676.46] [Music]

[696.92] I am going to sleep,
[701.16] Amma Amma, please forgive me
[714.90] [Music]
[722.23] [Music] Khuda Hafiz

[778.29] [Music]
[783.32] Oh hey, you have come,
[787.24] you have brought a big new model car, you too are my new model. Hey Chamak, let's go,
[793.88] sit quickly, come quickly, come Lafra or Vatka, otherwise they will take away my life. Bring the luggage,
[798.68] yes, everything is there, you will need some cash also and you will have to stay in Lahore for a few days.
[804.00] Oh Baba, everything has been kept. Come on or you will be caught
[819.27] [Music] Peepal leaves
[825.55] [Music]
[894.40] Come on from here, go inside, go inside, why did I come and why did I come and forbid
[900.88] you? Then why did I come? Tell me, please forgive me, Amma, I will not come again. Amma, please forgive me,
[906.60] I will never come, I don't want you to see everything, why don't you listen,
[910.88] why don't you agree with me, Amma, I was standing outside watching and those people
[915.96] sitting inside were watching, don't do nonsense, come and see me. Show me there, I will gouge out your eyes, I
[922.12] will break your leg [Music]
[925.32] I had come asking you to sleep, you have to wake up early for school,
[931.96] you have to study Kutu, we don't want to stay here, don't do this work, don't
[937.28] want to see anything, your elder one Before it happens, we should go away,
[941.76] but fate does not support us. This dancing and singing
[949.88] is not the work of the nobles, so why do you dance? Why do they pay? How many times have I told you to
[955.76] mind your own business? Why does everyone watch? Everyone sees something, why do you refuse me
[964.53] [Music] Ho Gu, I don't want you to see everything,
[970.64] I don't want us to stay here, but what should I
[977.12] do, son, I am very helpless, I don't even want to dance
[982.33] [Music] I want you to grow up I have to become a very big man
[987.84] [Music]
[996.28] Okay Guddu, now I will not
[1001.88] dance, I will never dance
