Due to you and Badka, my business has come to a standstill, friend, he did not bring any song yesterday, you did not bring it, neither does Seth bring Kareem, nor does Seth bring Nayat Ali. Look at this, all my flowers have dried up, friend. Let's bring four kangas for two or four yardsticks, go here, go there, oh friend, don't worry, double stitch, earn a kalam, friend, don't worry, child, it's a school holiday, it's a school holiday, because of this , all the work is on hold o Don't fool me, oh what relation do you have with school holidays? What a big relation you have, amazing one-eyed friend, you take your wife and children with you during the holidays. There are four more days to go but everything will be fine, so much of your work will be sold, so much of your work will be sold. I swear to God, the flowers will surpass your work, oh sugar in your mouth, oh by the way, listen to this friend, I don't know where this bud is, the night has come, I don't know whether he has slept or not, oh he must be lying in some corner of the man's room crying and look at me right He says, this is what will happen, listen to this good thing, friend, I haven't even had tea today, take it now, O Maqbool, those two cups of tea, page, friend, yes yes, you just order tea, I will bring him to him , black doubt, black black doubt, black is my black [ Music] [Music] Karat bhai ta bhai ya taka to nahi aaya tha why will he come early in the morning, he has troubled me a lot, hi hi, I have to talk to you very important, I have to tell you this, hosanna bhai ka chanda, Amma too must be sleeping. Chanda is also sleeping, what to talk about and in fact he cried a lot for Vaad, come to me [music] rest of the time he loves you, he loves you so much [music] he wants to marry you, you know that he is mad and Why are you telling me everything? Look, whatever he wants, it can't happen, he knows, so I am everything, what to do with Zeenat, whether youth is crazy or medicine, at this age no one stops at what someone says, please make him understand this. Tell me where he is, who knows where he is, please talk to him lovingly sometimes. Should I make him sit on my bed? Amma heard it, she won't even let me climb up from her breasts. You thought, she will be fine on her own. Oh, if I was the one to explain, I would have explained to her long time ago, just talk to me lovingly, it is very kind of you, don't eat my mind, you caught me, come here, come here, come like this, come like this, what happened to you, what happened Heera Bhai What happened, what is to happen, this bastard gave me fake notes, oh you gave me fake notes, wrote Eid Mubarak on the notes, made my girls dance for two hours, you said for two hours that you will give me Rs 2000, let it go, let it go, let it go. If the pauper were real, why would you give me a fake note ? Would I die running after it? I would not have seen this hand either, would I be able to die after going home? What a time has come, man, I have made a fool of you and gone with a fake note, that is bad, oh what happened to us? Fooled us, we fool the whole world, friend, think for yourself, why can't it be legal and Sharan? Is this wrong? It is not wrong, but she is much older than you, it does not matter when the man is 20 years younger than you. If you can marry a younger woman then why not marry a woman six to seven years older Shahram, this decision of yours is as emotional as the decision of Chanda, this decision of mine is not emotional. Look Zahid, I think that it is better than marrying an unknown girl. I should marry a woman whom I know, whose good and bad I am aware of, who can take care of me, who is decent, who is from a good family, who is educated, whether it is big or small, it does not matter, okay, you must have taken this decision after thinking but a little. Take a little more time and think seriously whether you are doing all this out of sympathy for them. Look, I am saying this so that you do not have to regret later, I will not regret, you just tell me that you are with them. Can you go and talk or not? Okay friend, I will talk but you are saying that she has refused. She thinks that I am doing this out of sympathy or because people should defame her because of me but it is not so Zahid. I have thought about it a lot, I feel as if I am incomplete without her, I care about her as if she is my own, yes, it is true that we have never thought about each other's attitude like this, but since Her father-in-law has put this thing in my mind, since then I have been thinking like this, Zahid, I feel as if I cannot leave her alone. I have seen, Zahid, that a single woman cannot survive in this world, people do not let her live. That is why I am saying that think once again, it is very important to have love between each other to live a lifetime and I think that there is no such feeling between you two, friend, you do not accept it. That I am serious, look at me Baba, I agree, I will also talk, okay, you should not just talk, please friend, Munne, we have to convey, look Zahid, what you are calling love is not love, I am not a child, but Shahram is really. He is a child and he himself doesn't even know what he is saying. Tell him that decisions in life are not taken with such emotion, but you will agree that he takes great care of you. Believe me, he talks about you even outside the house. I am not saying that there was anything between you two, but there was definitely some kind of emotion which did not allow her to think about anything else. However, it also happens that we are not able to recognize our emotions with Shahram. Look, Sahid, try to understand what I say. Look, whatever Shahram is going to do, its outcome is not good. Life is not just about marriage. Age is much bigger than that. There is much more beyond that. Look, more than the wife. A man needs a lot [Music] And I am not able to explain my point to you and Shahram is not ready to listen to me, you tell him that I cannot marry him and remove this thought from your mind. [Music] [Music] Shia Ram She did not agree and I understand that you cannot marry someone forcefully Na la ra ra ra na [Music] [Applause] Hello hello assalaam alaikum alaikum salam kaun ji woh zaira biwi se baat ho Who are you speaking? What work do you have? Yes, I am a state agent. He had talked about the potion at home. I have seen it. I have to take time from him for tomorrow so that I can show him that potion. Is there anyone here? Don't take the potion, please come, don't call me, but Zara B had said [music] If it is too much, but I will bring you peace in such a way that you will keep thinking that this will be worth lakhs, good [music] Yes, Salam, welcome talk. Hey, Chanda has fallen, quickly bring the car, hurry up, I will go and get Shaji, go brother, come again, come again, Ya Allah Khair [Music] Scene If something happens to Chanda, I am on the day of doomsday What will I show to Lara, that's why I used to tell her not to give birth to this child [Music] Find out what happened, just pray, everything will be fine Why aren't you bringing this out [Music] [Music] I was about to call you for food Eat [Music] Take, I am not hungry [Music] Sit, I had biscuits with tea in the evening, I am really not hungry, sit please [Music] [Music] [Music] Jairam, sit, I want to talk to you [Music] Why are you troubling yourself? I like that you are worried for me, but this is not the way to get me out of trouble. You start thinking about marriage [music] This is not your problem, you are the solution to my problem. Are you mad? Neither am I mad nor can a child understand my own good or bad. I know what will be the outcome of the decision of my case. Now please don't say this because you are older than me and hence this marriage cannot happen. It's fine. I have no love for you. I did not make big promises but I do know who is important for me and who is not important. You are very intelligent Shahram, you understand things, that is why I have a request from you that you will not take any decision without thinking. Look world. If we live in this world, we have to listen to the words of the people of the world. Many times people will talk, then why are you afraid? I am not afraid of anyone, that is why I do not want to marry out of fear. I know this Shahram that I cannot marry you. I respect your spirit. I believe that you have been useful to me in all my good and bad times. I also appreciate that I have got used to you. Maybe you too, no marriage. [Music] Shahram. Look, if you say, I will. I will not go from here, I will stay here, I will counter the words of all those people, okay, when they see that there is nothing like this between us, then they will automatically become silent, but you will not marry me, why no? Am I very bad? There are many flaws in me, can't I support you, can't I give you the happiness that is your right? Look here, look at me, now tell me what is lacking in me, there is no flaw in you, you are very good, that is why I want you. That you should marry a good girl. A good girl is only one who is younger than me, whether she knows me or not after marriage. Whether our life is good or bad, it is very emotional. How can I explain to you? Look, you had insisted earlier also that it was not for Chanda, but then you have forgotten her. If you are considering my decision to marry Chanda as emotional, then you are calling this decision of mine emotional. So this is very wrong and if you are refusing because of Chanda, I am not refusing because of Chanda, I am just telling you that a man can take emotional decisions at any age and neither your parents will accept this decision. Neither people, nor do I care about my parents, nor about people, in my world there is only you, why don't you understand, only you [music] I can't marry you, then listen to my decision too, I too will not marry all my life. I will do it [ music]
