[0.12] [Music]
[33.16] What's the problem? Why did you call me?
[36.36] Pari, you have to do something for me. What?
[42.04] You find out and tell me if Zarka wants to come back here or not. I already know that.
[46.28] She doesn't want to come. Don't tell yourself; ask her and let me know.
[50.72] I called her thrice. She hung up.
[54.28] Hey, tell her that because of her, Auntie's husband hit me.
[59.60] Forget her. You do one thing.
[64.48] Say to her to leave everything and come back. Hey Whiskey, Don't talk like this.
[69.96] And Mom heard it, he gave you one slap. Mom will at least give you 3  or 4 slap.
[74.60] And that face of yours, which is like a hero's, will get spoiled.
[79.88] Why are you getting involve in this issue? Forget it, man. Forget this issue.
[86.28] Do one thing for me. Hey, listen. I'm listening, go on. 
[92.64] Arrange a meeting for me with any handsome guy,  he must be rich  
[100.44] Don't make this face.
[104.48] Hey, Is there someone in your sight? Yes, Lafrah is here.
[108.44] Hey, I am not kidding. Go away, everyone thinks about themselves.
[113.92] No one cares about me.
[123.60] Sister, if you had any work, you could have called me. No, no, just sit down.
[128.68] I just want to say that whatever happened today has happened, make sure this does not happen again.
[134.12] Sister, I said it won’t happen again.
[139.52] I have said to my mom and my sister as well. They never come either. 
[145.56]  Okay. You haven't eaten, so go ahead and eat.
[149.05] No, sister. I'm not hungry. 
[152.80] I'm not feeling well.
[157.10] What happened to your health? Are you feeling something? Yes, sister.
[167.06] Tell me, what are you feeling? Sister
[173.41] When I cry. Yes, yes. 
[178.39] I get headache, and I'm still having a headache.
[185.00] Okay, that's fine.
[190.89] I was saying that whatever happened today, don't tell Murad. 
[196.24] He is already upset. If he finds out, he will get even angrier. Yes, sister, I swear by Allah.
[202.13] Now you won't have any trouble from me or my family. Okay.
[229.29] Asalam alikum, sister. Walikum asalam.  
[236.09] You had your breakfast? Yes, I have. And you?
[242.58] Sister, I was very hungry in the morning because I didn't eat at night. 
[250.72] Get ready; you need to come with me for a bit.  
[256.77] Where do we need to go?
[259.77] Sister, you’re not going to drop me home, are you?
[265.74] No, there's no need to worry. We will be back in an hour.
[286.81] Yes doctor sir, I want to get her pregnancy test. Okay,
[291.99] Who is she to you? Yes, she is my cousin's wife.
[297.52]  How many days has it been since their wedding? Yes, 5 days. No, no.
[301.61] It's been more than 5 days. But what difference does it make? By the test we can find out if it's positive or negative?
[308.93] Yes, we can find out. 
[318.53] you people in such a hurry to have a child?
[319.77] Everyone wants to have a baby, this is the only reason,
[342.08] Where were you? You go inside.
[355.52] Shumail, I am asking something?
[359.46] At the doctor's. Why? Is everything okay?
[367.57] To get Zarka's pregnancy test, is it positive or negative?
[373.88] You have gone crazy. How can her test be positive?
[379.08] What do you mean by that? 
[384.00] There is no relationship between us. What?
[391.69] [Music] 
[402.24] What?
[405.25] Well, that means all the suffering you’ve endured for so many days has been completely in vain. 
[410.56] So, it's because of you, if on the first day
[413.88] you hadn't created any trouble, the result would have been positive by now.
[416.64] And after the result is positive, he wouldn't go to her, right?
[420.16]  You are absolutely right, Auntie. I agree that the mistake is mine.
[426.85] But I promise, I will do exactly as you say.
[433.39] Look, Shumail, I don't want to give you any advice again.
[435.91] And then you again create a scene. And
[439.93] Sharam has firmly forbidden me to get involved in this matter now.
[445.16]  This will not happen at all now.
[448.46] I also want that when so much has been done, there should be some reward for it.
[455.21] You know Murad and his nature.
[459.20] He can't live his whole life without seeing his parents.
[463.72] It's just a few days; the anger will go away.
[467.28] And then you know, I have the same torment of being childless. Yes, that's it.
[474.37] Look, if you understand the matter, then talk to Murad first.
[478.80] Assure him that you won't fight with him anymore.
[482.24] Explain to him that the purpose of bringing Zarka into this house was to have children.
[486.99] And also, treat Zarka like a family member.
[490.59] She must be a little scared because of your behavior, right?
[493.37] Involve her with you. The three of you should sit together and eat.
[497.74] In fact, if possible, take her for some outing.
[501.51] If you don't do this, how will there be a bond between the two of them?
[507.60] Now, this is what I have to do.
[511.16] It's just a matter of once, Shumail.
[513.96] Who knows, maybe Allah will fulfill your wish in just one go.
[517.76] Okay. Do talk to Murad.
[526.30] I will.
[527.85] [Music]
[551.88] I'm sorry, it was my mistake.
[558.30] Yes, it was your mistake. Yes, I have accepted it,
[572.56] Send her back.
[577.72] Look, whatever deprivation Allah has given.
[584.01] Accept it. No, Murad, God has put this thought in my heart.
[592.57] That's why everything has happened so easily.
[595.82] Otherwise, we had no other option. Now think that we could have children this way.
[601.40] Shumail, you please, Murad, please. Okay, I promise. I won't fight anymore; I won't say anything.
[607.29] And then think for yourself.
[609.54] It's unfair to Zarka as well. She is married, and... Okay, that's enough.
[615.92] The truth is that I am not able to accept all of this.
[621.46] I know why you are not able to. But please, everything is fine now, right? Please.
[627.93] Please trust me for my sake.
[632.74] Shumail, I have done everything for your sake.
[636.20] So for everything else, please do it for my sake.
[641.74] Well, I can see how much you love me.
[647.28] I am asking reward for this love.
[652.49] You are very foolish. You took the girl to the hospital.
[656.22] You could have asked me once. What would that girl be thinking?
[660.52] Yes, that's true. I didn't even think about it.
[665.63] She was also very surprised, as if she wanted to say something to me
[670.13] I did'nt listen. You're an idiot.Yes, I am.
[683.05] Turn off the lights, Let's go to sleep now. 
[698.97]  Yes Pari, how are you?
[703.28] I am fine. How is mom?
[707.46] Okay. Do you know she took me to the hospital yesterday?
[711.96] Hospital. Why did she take you to the hospital?
[715.36] She thought I was going to be a mother. Really? You’re going to be a mother?
[721.16] No, how would I become?
[724.40] He doesn’t even talk to me. Until now, he hasn’t even touched me.
[728.31] Oh no! Then why did she take you to the hospital? You didn’t tell her.
[733.60] She didn't listen to me
[735.77] This is not a marriage, you can't give birth like this. By the way, the fact is
[743.33] I'm very happy like this. You’re crazy!
[747.00] Oh, if you want to stay there, then don’t hesitate to confront him.
[752.33] I can't do it. I'm really scared of Shumail.
[758.08] If she takes any of my words the wrong way, she will throw me out of the house.
[763.08] Okay, forget it. Now put the phone down.
[766.62] And don’t tell mom all my things. She would get upset.
[770.95] Okay, fine. If you say so, I won’t tell.
[774.08] But remember one thing, Zarka. He has married you. You are his wife.
[778.81] You also have some rights over him. Give me the phone.
[784.40] What are you saying, Zarka?
[786.48] Oh, he has married you. Why hasn’t he come to you?
[794.71] So what, mom, atleast I got married right?
[800.40] I am in my husband's house.
[804.00] Why are you worried? Isn’t it enough that I am
[810.91] happy here!
[815.67] I want to stay here.
[818.83] It feels good.
[834.00] Mom, if she is happy then why are you worried about her?
[846.67] Shumaila are you there? Yeah, Good evening. Hii. Listen, I am very hungry.
[852.51] Quickly serve the food; I will just get fresh. Murad I didn’t cook today.
[857.64] What? Why?
[860.50] Because I was in the mood to eat out today.
[866.52] Not bad. You get ready. I'll come down after freshening up. I am ready.
[872.68] Give me the car keys. I will be waiting for you downstairs.
[876.92] You know what, I was so hungry that I was thinking of calling
[880.48]  you to tell you to keep food ready. But anyway, I am coming
[893.49] [Music]
[913.18] [Music] 
[947.20] Do one thing, serve appetizers quickly. Okay.
[953.69] You want anything else? No!
[959.12] Excuse me
[968.96] Excuse me. What happened? Why you have bandage?
[975.07] My hand got burned. How?
[980.08] I was cooking the curry, the oil spilled on my hand. Why didn’t you tell?
[987.47] There was nothing to tell about this. It was just a little burn. Did you tell Shumail?
[994.20] Yes. That’s why food couldn't be prepared at home today.
[1000.74] Her hand is burned. Yes, I said to her, should have told me. But she told me after tying the bandage.
[1007.24] She is saying it’s just a little burned, not too much.
[1011.12] You applied something on it?
[1013.77] Yes. Mom says if you apply toothpaste or cream on a burn, it helps relieve the pain.
[1020.46] So I applied toothpaste and then bandaged it. Okay, let’s go home and show me.
