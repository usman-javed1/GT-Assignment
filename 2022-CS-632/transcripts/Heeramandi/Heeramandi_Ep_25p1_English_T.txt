[0.32] Call her! I am calling, it's ringing, no one
[8.04] is picking up
[11.00] Habib, I am not able to understand one thing that if Murad has really divorced Zarka then
[17.84] why did he or his wife not tell us. They should have told us.
[22.96] Call her again. I am calling her.
[28.44] Have some patience
[48.07] [Music]
[55.35] [Music]
[75.80] For God's sake, don't divorce me, I will not go anywhere else
[81.60] I will stay with you only. I will serve you,
[87.32] I made a mistake, forgive me. Stop your nonsense, you
[93.60] are divorced. No sister, I will not go, I will stay with you.
[99.16] Your father will also go. Murad tell the driver, it is morning, so now drop her back.
[103.96] Go away! What are you doing? Have you gone mad?
[109.08] Yes, I have gone mad, tell the driver to take  this filth in the same
[112.72] place from where we brought it. No, for God's sake. What are you doing? What am I doing? 
[118.84] She is a drama. Murad, just shut up now!
[125.84] We have to take her to the doctor. Listen, if anything happens to her, it
[133.48] will be very bad for you too. What is wrong with you Murad? What happened to you?
[138.43] Take care of yourself
[147.72] [Music]
[154.37] It's Okay ... Relax
[156.57] [Music]
[159.12] Open the door. I will also come with you.
[166.19] Open gate Quickly....
[175.75] [Music]
[191.12] Lafray, you come with me, what those bastards think about themself? 
[195.84] You keep quiet quite. 
[198.84] Hema, drink a glass of water. Are you waiting for her to die? Tell me
[204.04] what happened? I am telling you, if he even touches Zarka, I will break his hands and feet
[208.40] Hema Aunty, you come with me, we will bring her back, I will account for every penny.
[215.24] If they pay me the full amount, then I will bring her. You come with me. Habib, I
[220.52] had told you earlier to tell him not to come here. Why is he stepping inside my house?
[226.16] Look, I am standing outside your house, I am not inside. If you won't keep quiet then I will
[230.64] hit you hard. Keep quiet. Chanda, he is right.
[237.80] I will go with Lafrah and check what is happening there. Hema, be patient, right now we don't know
[242.88] what has happened there. I don't know why Zarka has called. Maybe husband and wife had
[248.72] some small dispute? Yes Hema, Chanda is right. If such a thing had happened,
[255.80] then Murad or his wife or the woman who had arranged the relationship would have called. You have patience. Yes,
[264.12] yes, be patient, even if they kill her. You keep quiet. I am telling you, if you
[270.52] guys don't go, I will go and get her. Habib, tell him, if he goes there, I
[277.24] will kill him. Okay, that's it. Pari, call her. I am calling her.
[284.96] she is not picking up. O Habib, why are you listening to women? Come with me. Are you
[291.24] going or shall I hit you? Hey, I got hurt!
[296.92] How can I be patient, he is right.
[304.12] Oh Hema, have a little more patience, maybe when you go there, there is nothing
[313.12] that you are talking about. Hey Pari, come here,
[321.20] Give me phone. I don't know whom she has been calling for the last two hours. You can see now? Keep quiet,
[328.64] How to use it? Let her do it. Pari you dial number.
[344.84] Please stop, no need of injection,
[347.04] her blood pressure has become very low. Due to which she has become unconscious, you
[352.56] stay with her, I will come right away
[364.48] Yes Doctor. What happened to her?
[381.44] She suddenly fell while standing. She is your?
[387.80] She is my wife!
[391.60] How is she now? By the way It's normal,
[396.04] everything is fine, just the blood pressure had gone down and it happens in such a situation, you
[400.76] should take great care of her, is this your first child? What?
[408.88] I don't have any children. Then I should congratulate you. Congratulations, you
[414.28] are going to be a father 
[419.79]  [Music]
[436.80] Sheram!
[439.92] Take tea, I am preparing breakfast for you. No, I
[447.20] will not have breakfast, I have to go early, I have some important work.
[456.72] Hello, everything okay, why are you calling early in the morning?
[464.04] Really? Excellent! This is a very good news, yes yes, congratulations, you all are
[471.36] at home, yes, I am definitely coming, okay.
[477.96] Zarka is pregnant!
[484.88] Can you drop me there while going to the office? Yes sure, you get ready,
[492.96] Okay!
[497.48] Hey Guddu. Listen to me, I am coming with you, but
[505.60] do not create mess there. I have already said it, if it turns out to be true and Zarka is
[510.76] not paid in full, I will not leave them. Hey, you will not do anything, what I am saying to you?
[515.12] I will talk. I know how to deal with them.
[522.20] You will talk like this? Hey, what else should I do, wear bangles in hands? Come
[528.80] Make me sit. Oh Old man, after the operation, you have become more dependable
[535.40] Thank God, I am saved. Guddu, drive carefully
[544.72] Be careful, Drive slow
[552.52] You have divorced me? There has been no divorce and I will not do it again.
[560.36] You have said it thrice. Yes, I have definitely said it. But look, a woman who
[568.56] is about to become a mother does not get a divorce. Okay, and I will not do this again
[575.12] Please do not take tension. When I will
[579.76] have a child, she will forcibly get me divorced, I don't want divorce
[585.60] She won't do this. I agree that she is a little angry, she is emotional, she
[592.00] talks, she fights, but please forgive her,
[598.04] What else can I do, but what had I done. You
[602.76] haven't done anything, it is my fault,
[606.80] Why did it become your fault to come to me?
[614.40] Please forget all these things and just
[621.16] take care of yourself, I am sure, she will not quarrel with you now. Will not
[627.60] cause any problem to you. Tell me, did you eat something,
[634.04] Shall bring anything for you. I am not hungry,
[639.28] Zarka, even if you are not hungry, you still have to eat something, okay? Forcefully!
[647.24] And I have said for the maid too. She will take care of you and you
[653.84] don't need to do household chores. Okay don't worry,
[660.20] I'll bring you something. You haven't eaten anything since last night
[663.92]  [Music] 
[684.24] Shumail .... Congratulations! You should'nt have fought with Murad.
[693.20] Thanks to Allah, you just
[697.80] have to be patient for nine more months. You have to take care of Zarka because you
[703.48] want a healthy child. Where is Zarka? In her room. Where
[709.48] are you going? She is not alone, she is with Murad
[716.96] You are crying in happiness or ...  I don't know
[723.28] whether I am are crying in happiness or sadness, I just know that
[728.92] I should not have done what I did. Murad had also told me that he would never
[733.08] leave me under any circumstances. What is the need to make a scene,
[739.56] We all explained it to you, but you only obeyed your friend, but
[746.28] now it's okay, your purpose has been fulfilled, now you should be happy, it's just a matter of nine months, now
[750.88] Murad also don't have to go to her, but you
[756.04] should take care of her. Shumail is very stupid
[761.44] Thank God that nothing happened to that girl.
[766.04] If something wrong had to her, then both of you would have been in trouble. I too
[772.40] had the same fear. Shumail did not do well.
[776.60] When I took her to the hospital, then I came to know that she is pregnant
[784.11] [music] 
[789.92] Now this story has started, how will Shumail tolerate it? She have to do
[795.24] this because I can't tolerate any more misbehavior of Shumail,
[799.88] Obviously in this condition you can't leave her. 
[805.48]  
[810.76] Why don't you talk to your mrs about it I mean if she talk to Shumail then ...
[817.56] No Murad, I think you should. If I say it won't sound good.
[823.63] [Music]
[826.72] Okay I will talk to her. Infact I have to talk to Shumail too.
[833.68] Sir, some people came from Madam Zarka's house. Send them inside.
[841.28] Did you tell her family or not? No, maybe Zarka called.
[850.56] Okay Murad I have to go. Sit for a while, have some tea etc.
[859.20] I'm fine, there is some important work, let's meet in the evening. 
[875.12]  
[878.92] Please have a seat. What's the matter sir, if you have given divorce, then settle the score, and return the girl.
[885.52] Hey, shut up! Please sit. Thank you Sir!
[894.32] [Music]
[900.80] Sir, Zarka's called us, she says for Godbiden, if you have divorced her.
[907.56] So you all have come to take her? Definately Sir, now there is no reason for her to stay here.
[915.00] The deal was that ... She will not go anywhere from here.
[919.04] What do you mean? You will forcefully stop her? Oh, you
[924.12] keep quiet, let me talk.
[926.92] My point is that if you have divorced her ... I have not divorced her.
[936.40] Zarka is mad that she called us at midnight, you call Zarka, in what condition she is
[943.88] what happened to her, we will ask her. I am telling you sir, is there even the slightest mistake
[947.76] I won't let her stay here. Don't misbehave.
[951.19] No one said anything to her, that's why
[956.80] she won't go anywhere. But Sir, what's the matter? She
[960.88] is going to be a mother.
[965.96] Really? Sir, is this true? Why will I lie to you?
[971.09] You are lying sir!
[975.32] If she is going to have a child then why did she call, why did she say that you
[980.24] are divorcing her? I will call Zarka, ask yourself.
[987.58] Can't you shut up, just talking rubbish.
[992.16] Do you understand what he means? Zarka's is expecting, now she will not leave from here,
[999.36] Just shut up, we have come here to take Zarka and listen, even if a child is being born.
[1004.52] Don't worry, we will get abort. You just somehow convince Zarka that she will go with
[1009.92] us, we won't leave her here.
