[0.00] Hey, look, I've even shown you the sea today!
[2.84] It’s not just a sea view; it’s the real ocean! Look how the water is splashing up! Yes
[8.80] Hey, look! Just look!
[11.28] I’m feeling scared.
[13.00]  Oh, I'm here for you!
[17.00] Whisky!
[18.32] If I call you Shehryar...
[21.12] So you wouldn’t feel bad, right?
[22.88] I don’t like your name, Whisky
[25.32] Hey, what's in a name? You can call me anything!
[28.00] After all, it’s just money—nothing more.
[32.48]  Tell me one thing.
[33.72] Shall I tell you something, the way our mothers carry themselves with dignity...
[36.40] This won't change anything for anyone.
[39.24] I say...
[40.76] If you also get chance like Zarka...
[43.48] avail it. I swear everyone will be stunned! I swear.
[48.00] But Shehryar, my heart wants to... Hey, listen, listen, listen!
[51.40] Call me Whisky.
[52.84]  It seems like you're calling someone else.
[56.20]  Okay, Whisky.
[57.80] By the way, do you have a heart or not?
[61.92] It should be there; I’ve never seen it, but it must be somewhere.
[66.00] It must be lost; I'll just have to find it.
[67.84]  Hey, the gol gappay!
[69.60] You’ll eat. Shall I bring?
[71.40] But you said you would take me to a big hotel and treat me to food.
[75.60] Hey, I’ll take you there too. Just be patient!
[78.12]  You know what?
[79.20]  I’ve heard the food there is really delicious!
[81.60] Big people come there. That’s why I want you to come with me.
[87.48] I want to go there to eat.
[89.84]  not to make customers
[93.96] Hey, first bring the gol gappay for you, and then I’ll take you there too.
[102.28] I wish you had a heart in your chest too.
[105.52] As deep as this ocean.
[110.92] Just praying to Allah that I get a good proposal for Pari as well.
[115.76] Get her married too!
[123.96] Assalamualaikum.
Walaikum Assalam. Please have a seat.
[128.00] Zarka, the volume of tv is too loud; the sound is going outside.
[132.60] Yes.
[134.80] Yes, I am very grateful to you.
[140.00] No, there’s no need to be grateful.
[143.00] There’s a agreement between you and me.
[146.20] When that is fulfilled, the matter will be settled.
[149.56] Yes, I just came to meet my daughter.
[152.68]  I'm really happy to see her happy.
[155.96] Married daughters look very good.
[159.92]  I wanted to say something to you. If I take Zarka with me...
[165.60] We’ll drop her back in the evening. Mother
[170.16] Not in the evening.
[171.60] We'll drop her off at night.
[173.08] In fact, if she stays even at night, it would be even more fun!
[178.08] I am sorry, she can’t go anywhere.
[180.52] As long as she is with us, she can't go anywhere.
[184.48] What’s going on, Aunty?
[186.60] How can we just leave her like that?
[188.64] Should we end all our meetings and interactions with her?
[191.68]  No, I’m not saying to stop meeting or interacting.
[193.52] Just like you all came over now, you can come like that again.
[197.36] That was the agreement, right?
[199.04] No, that wasn’t the agreement. Just be quiet.
[204.20]  Yes, this was the agreement.
[207.64] You have a right over Zarka. Will do as you want.
[209.80] It's not about right, 
[213.80] It's about commitment and principles.
[217.36] Yes, you’re absolutely right.
[220.00] As you wish.
[222.00] Mother, this is what I’ve seen always.
[224.68] On the first day after the wedding, the girl goes to her Parent's home.
[229.48] Be quiet.
[233.16] Alright, sister.
[236.76] I won’t go anywhere.
[247.76] Rani, look over there. She's looking at that place.
[250.44] One day, I'll make so much money that I'll build my house in the water.
[254.16] There will be cold water below.
[256.24] Cool, refreshing breeze, and I'll take you everywhere with me.
[259.32] And if we perish into the water...
[261.20] Hey, you’ve gone crazy! I mean like this...
[263.20] I'll dive in and come back up; I know how to swim.
[265.52] Really? Yes, why not?
[268.20] By the way, Whisky, my heart wants to...
[270.36] we both go to Dubai.
[272.68] Hey, what we will do in Dubai?
[274.40] Our city is Karachi.
[275.72] You’ve not seen its colors.
[278.28] Yes, that’s true.Do you know?
[281.04] Since I’ve come to Karachi...
[283.88] I’m really enjoying it.
[285.12] How many days has it been since you came?
[286.64] Just keep watching; you'll see what you like in our city.
[290.48] By the way, the reason Karachi feels good is...
[293.44] someone else too.
[296.60] Hey, you’re not involved with someone, are you?
[301.32] Yes, there is.
[303.24] Come on, tell me who it is!
[306.16] We're friends. Just tell me who it is! I'm not telling.
[309.96] Come on, just tell me!
[311.84] Look, you don't trust me. Just tell me.
[314.28] You’ll figure it out yourself.
[315.96] Hey, is it that old man Lafarh?
[319.20] You know Habib, 
[321.64] That woman who came to negotiate for Zarka, right?
[325.40] I already know her.
[328.48] Chanda, how do you know her?
[332.72] You remember, Police man kidnapped me?
[337.08] When I escaped from there...
[339.44] That's time I met that woman. Yes, I rememeber, you told me, she took you to her house
[349.76] I recognise her as I saw. She also recognise me. She was asking me
[361.42] I have seen you somewhere. But I changed the topic
[363.42] What should I say?
[365.42] Now I think, it's a small world. Years before a woman helped me
[375.52] I can not even imagine, I will ever meet her again in life and her problems will bring her here.
[383.52] Sometimes I think, If ever I see Guudu's father then what I will do?
[388.52] I should stop going out. By the way, Chande ...
[397.00] What If you ever found Guudu's father in real then what you will do?
[410.56] I don't know. May be I will hold his collar and ask him ....
[418.96] why you left in my womb? But then I think, I don't have any right
[428.96] If I ever see him, I will hit him hard. I swear to God
[437.96] You know Whisky, I am scared of Camel.
[444.80] Why are you scared of camel, he is an innocent animal.
[447.80] He is not innocent, he is so big. I feel I will fall after sitting on it. He is tall
[455.72] Hey, water is cold. Don't throw on me. I will also throw on you. Here you go ...
[467.80] Hey, watch out. You will slip, I will get in trouble. Come here.
[474.52] You Okay? Yes Okay ... Then take this. I am all wet
[482.40] Rani, this is Park Tower. All rich people of Karachi shops here. Clothes, Jewellry, Shoes
[494.64] Here they have vegetable shop too. They do even grocery here also.
[496.64] Are sure Whisky? Definately, Let's go up by lift
[500.64] God's Blessing. World is so advance
[508.48] Listen, do not touch anything here. If anything break then we have to pay full cost of it.
[513.44] What do you mean Whisky? It's not my first experience to market.
[515.44] Actually this place is for elites.
[519.92] Everything is available here. Look there, jewellry shop, Clothes shop even shoes too. Come ...
[535.92] [Music]
[542.92] Let's go here.
[549.92] Wow, they have beautiful things. Look at this. Things are expensive here.
[559.44] I'll buy for you from other place. I know
[564.44] you have money today.
[568.44] You buy me something today. If we like anything then we will see.
[575.52] Hey, Whisky ... this is so pretty. Check the price tag.
[582.48] Now, you know?
[585.48] I never thought this will happen to my daughter. Have patience.
[590.84] Mother, quite now. You yourself did this all.
[596.84] Keep your mouth shut. I am already worried.
[603.52] What happened? Hema, everything is fine? Where is Zarka? What happened?
[611.24] Why are you always crying? They did not allowed her to come with us.
[614.72] What was wrong in sending her for a day?
[618.72] Where is Whisky? I will ask him, what deal he made with them?
[627.88] She is alive not dead, that we can not meet her neither she can come here.
[631.60] Okay enough! You tell me Hema what happened exactly?
[640.88]  They are right. Agreement says, Unless the baby is not born she cannot come back.
[649.88]  But Hema, there is no harm in allowing her for a day
[655.88] The agreements says she will stay there. Not a day, they can't allow her even for an hour.
[663.12] You people have forgotten, they took Zarka from brothel. No one will trust us.
[671.44] How ever we say that our girls are innocent, but still they are prostitute for rest of the world.
[681.44] Still you are crying Hema. Once you made a commitment so its done. They at least did not stopped you from meeting her.
[689.44] If they stop you from seeing her than let me know, I will talk to them
[696.40] They never stopped me from seeing her. Then, no big deal.
[702.48] Have you gone mad? How can she leave? Unless she gives birth, hands the
[707.48] baby over to us, she cannot go.
[712.48] We cannot trust her; she is a prostitute.
[715.36] What if she goes back and forms a relationship with another man?
[719.24] I don't want a child
[723.04] I got scared in just a single day. I cannot tolerate her
[728.48] Ask Murad to divorce her and send her back home. I will clear her all amount
[734.00] What are you talking? What is wrong with you Shumail?
[740.00] If that's what you wanted to do, then why did you create this whole scene?
[746.00] Shehram scolded me; you and Murad had fights because of all this. Is it a joke, that we will give them 10 lacs.
[751.00] Let the purpose be fulfilled. Tolerate this all now.
[756.00] I cannot. I feel she will take Murad away from me. I don't know
[760.00] you just talk to Murad.
[773.00] Shehram, did you tell Baji about Chanda? How I can tell her.
[779.08] Don't tell her. Otherwise you will ruin your peaceful life.
[788.08] Stop thinking about Chanda, infact forget about her.
[798.48] I forgot her, but when I saw her at the wedding, the past came rushing back to me
[805.48] I just want to apologise her about the promise I made. I want to tell her how helpless I was
[813.64] There is no need of it or maybe she don't even remember you.
[818.24] A prostitute has a new man in her life every day
[822.00] They can't remember every single man.
[825.00] And what if you said sorry to her and she asked you, May I know you?
[829.92] How you will feel? Leave this Chanda topic now.
[836.40] What shall I do? I told you ....
[842.92]  
[848.92]  
[860.08] Shumail, that's why I said No to you. But you did not listened to me once.
[868.60] I already know you can't bear all of this. I am a man, but I still know that women can't bear sharing
[874.60] Whatever happened was by your choice so now please, don't blame me.
[881.60]  
[885.60] Children are not born just by signing marriage papers
[893.60] Anyways, do what ever you want to do. You want to keep her or let her go, I have no issues.
[899.40] Murad, I am not saying this. I know you did this for my sake
[909.40] And I know that she is now your wife, unless she gives birth.
[916.40] We need her
[923.40] Then why are you crying?
[927.36] Because I am your wife and I love you very much.
[933.88] Just as children represent our helplessness, these tears also reflect my helplessness.
[940.24] Ignore my tears. For God's sake....
[945.24] Don't do this. I get tense by seeing you in this condition. Already I am having headache.
[955.92] Do one thing ....
[960.00] Either change your behaviour or end this matter but please stop crying
[967.00] [Music]
[972.00] I couldn't sleep properly, I need some rest.
[976.00] Yes, I am sorry.
[984.08] Please don't cry.
[986.32] [Music]
[996.36] [Music]
