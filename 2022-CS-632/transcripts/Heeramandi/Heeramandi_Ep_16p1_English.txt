Lafray, Death is the name of Silence and if you are going to die, She is dead, now take care of Vodka. I have heard that if someone does not cries on death, then their grief can become worse. I know, I don't know. What should I do? Take him to doctor. Have you gone mad?  He doesn't come inside this room, he will go to the doctor? He is waiting for Zeenat on stairs, He doesn't need doctor.  The day he will believe that Zeenat is dead, he will cry This is the problem, how will he believe? How will this silence be broken? Oh friend, leave this, you go to your wife, she must be waiting for you. No friend, today I don't want to go today What has happened to Vodka? I said to him take care of yourself I was meant to be with him     Aunty Guddu keeps asking about Zeenat again and again and Lafda was telling that Vodka is not fine and has not slept since that day,  he is very worried for him. He was saying it is very important for Vodka to cry and sleep  Where is Vodka? Has he left? Sitting on the stairs outside the door. He is not going anywhere. [Music]  I will talk to him.
