[4.68] [Music] 
[16.24] How are you Zarka?
[20.28] I am fine. Where is Hema Auntie? Where she has gone? She has gone
[27.56] to the market, Pari had to buy some things.
[33.36] Sit down,
[39.00] Zarka, I want to talk to you,
[44.32] What you want to talk? Do you remember, that a woman came to our place?
[51.32] The one who liked you
[56.40] and while leaving she had said that she will give Rs10 lakhs,
[65.80] if you follow my advice then don't refuse 
[73.92] What? Say yes to her.
[79.68] You bastard, you want to sell me to clear your way,
[83.76] I will beat you. Hey, you said the same nonsense again, hey,
[90.92] how did you touch her? Tell me one thing, what do you think, I will marry you, who
[96.84] is the child of a courtesan, who is not even sure about her father.
[101.76] The one who dances on the brothel and goes to people's houses. Whiskey, don't talk nonsense, you
[106.48] too are not the child of any noble person, you are the child of courtesan. I am a man  and man can do everything,
[111.24] A man can do everything. Whatever is sin for me is a sin for you also.
[117.92] Don't you feel ashamed that your fiancee .... Keep quiet, Stop calling yourself my fiancee,
[124.60] Who said that you are my fiancee? I never accepted you as
[128.88] my fiancee and Listen one thing, you will come back even after dying 10 times, even then I
[133.96] will not marry you. Hey, I don't know what you do in people's houses. Whisky!
[144.20] Let's go ...
[148.84] [music]
[153.60] [music]
[166.43] [music]
[184.52] Madam, that girl is not ready but don't worry, you select some other girl and
[191.80] there were two more girls, Rani and Pari. Look, this is a matter of our next generation. I
[199.64] am not buying that girl, I am getting her married, I am getting
[203.68] her married properly. She will live with us in this house for one year. I swear Madam 
[213.12] there is nothing wrong with both of girls, they are good looking and even well behaved
[217.04] you once Look at them again. But why this girl is not agreeing?
[223.28] Is it a matter of money? If it is such a thing, then let's decide. No Madam, money is good
[229.16] you leave her, she is unlucky. She is not agreeing
[236.16] You can go there with me whenever you want, choose anyone you like
[242.92] Today? Whenever you want. You will have to wait a little, 
[250.68] I am waiting, Madam
[257.24] You want tea or juice? ... Juice!
[273.08] Oh Allah, make any girl agree. Aameen 
[277.00] 10 Lakh is a big amount. Look at mother, she have spent her whole life
[283.00] but till date she have not been able to earn that much money and
[285.12] then the jewellery, you know the gold prices are too high. Poor Mother
[290.28] has been thinking for a long time to buy small jewellery set but still unable to make it and may God bless
[296.76] Vodka, he died otherwise we had to pay the rent of this place too. If you will agree then
[303.84] all our sorrows and pains will go away and then we have never seen this much money before
[310.32] If you don't want to get married, then it's okay,
[316.68] I tell mother that I am ready, I will get money and I will
[322.04] have fun too. And it's not a big deal to control a man, I will control him the way
[328.08] not only divorce, he will forget his wife too. If Rani agrees then
[336.00] all the fun and all the money will go there and I will tell Whiskey that I
[342.24] am ready for this marriage. If we cannot do anything else for mother, the least we
[348.20] can do is to buy peace for her till her death. Poor mother
[355.24] has spent her whole life in sorrow because of us. She is so troubled.
[360.72] Now mother is unwell too. My only wish is to see mother Happy
[368.23] [Music] 
[375.41] Last time too, after seeing you, I
[385.80] felt as if I have seen you somewhere,
[392.40] Madam, women like us roam around from place to place,
[397.56] you must have seen me anywhere. See, any girl agree, 
[406.12] it doesn't matter to me, the real thing is that your girls are decent, I mean
[413.08] they have no relation with such people, otherwise there are thousands of
[417.96] girls available in this money.
[422.64] But the point is that who knows how they have relations with whom.
[429.84] Our compulsion is a child
[435.37] If you have children, then it is a problem, if not, then also a problem.
[446.20] But I cannot help you in this regard,
[451.72] Mother, please convince Rani, talk to Neelam Aunty, I swear, the days will change,
[459.24] No. You know I don't involve myself in such things and then
[464.92] why should I take someone else's crime upon myself? Talk yourself, Rani, if you agree to Madam 
[473.60] No Whiskey, you know I don't do this work
[480.40] and If we wanted to earn money this way, we could have done dirty business also. They
[488.24] are all unlucky. They don't want to change their circumstances. They are kicking the wealth
[495.84] If you talk, try to convince the girl,
[501.08] No, I can't do this
[505.64] First of all, Rani is not my daughter, I can't force her,
[513.68] her mother has gone out,
[518.84] she must be coming, if you want, then wait for her.
[525.00] If my work here is not done then I will regret a lot, I came here under great compulsion,
[531.28] I realized for the first time that
[537.32] what can a person do under compulsion
[550.28] Madam, 
[555.08] I am ready... Zarka? 
[563.44] It's good that she agreed to the marriage, otherwise I had thought, that if she doesn't
[569.60] agree then I will get married. Mother, now you talk to Madam to
[575.32] give us half the amount in advance, after all we have to prepare for the marriage.
[580.24] What are you thinking mother?
[584.36] Mother call Whiskey and take Madam's number from her and talk to her right now.
[591.04] Hey, you shut up, you are worried about your money and things,
[597.52] I am worried about my daughter, what will happen to her
[603.48] [Music]
[611.27] [Music]
[620.88] It's my son, you Why did you take this decision
[628.74] [laughter] Because
[635.68] no one here needs me, no one realizes me, it
[645.44] doesn't matter to anyone whether
[651.36] I stay, go away, get sold or die
[664.64] , why did you guys get me
[668.12] engaged to my son Zeenat? Why did you let me do
[675.00] this, Amma? How did I know that Whiskey would do all this?
[680.56] Vicky is a small human being,
[686.16] Amma, he knows how to sell, Amma,
[691.80] he only cares about the fat Assamese,
[696.44] rather than living here and complaining, it is better that I get married,
[705.60] I am like this. Amma , I will be of use to you people,
[711.00] Amma, you will have enough money to get married in a good place,
[717.80] now you can
[723.52] spend the rest of your life comfortably,
[726.84] Amma, because of me, a destitute woman will get a child,
[735.28] I will get her blessings.
[741.48] Amma Amma, I will be found,
[746.68] so what if I couldn't do anything for myself , at least do something for others
[755.06] [Music] [Praise]
[757.33] [Music] Jangi ri don't worry
[762.96] [Music] Don't worry about me,
[768.88] I will be happy
[776.58] [ Music] 
[782.88] No Neelam, you know I don't like such things, then what right do I have to
[790.04] explain or convince Rani? I was very happy when
[796.36] she herself refused in front of Madam. She couldn't agree. If we want money to be earned like this,
[802.04] we would have earned it long ago. Do you know that I
[808.16] had a loan of 80 thousand, a year ago, how I paid it, I know or my 
[814.92] God knows, but tell me one thing. How did this Zarka agree?
[823.44] It's her compulsion
[830.00] She loves Guddu and wants to marry him but Guddu
[837.20] doesn't agree. Now what else that poor girl will do?
[840.68] Listen, did you talked to Hema?
[847.44] What is the benefit? That girl's heart is broken,
[854.20] Chanda, I am
[859.60] going to see the boy for Zarka tomorrow,
[862.92] you will go with me? You know that I don't go any where
[868.44]  
[871.40] If you want, you can take Neelam. You will go yourself or
[878.16] someone will pick you? No, I will go with Whiskey, you will go with me? Yes, okay. I will go with you
[894.13] [Music] 
[903.20] Zarka If mother tells that he is 50 years old, then what will happen? If he
[911.68] is 100 years old, I will still marry him, now I will curse Whisky,
[918.88] What he think about himself? Is he big boss? Or
[924.84] a child of a noble family or is he Prince Gulfam?
[930.28] When your own people starts taunting  about being a courtesan,
[933.24] then what is the use of decency? He is crazy, by the way, let me tell you one thing, you thought
[940.44] that he will marry you, he has no interest in you.
[945.36] I have understood it well and now I have also taken an oath that I
[952.68] will never even talk to him. Okay, let's not take useless oath. Mother is here.
[959.96] What kind of people are they? They are very nice people, Pari. Very nice and Zarka
[968.12] Saraka, I liked everyone very much, they are decent people. Mother,
[976.36] The boy is 50 years old? Come on, the boy is also very nice and
[986.40] do you know what madam said? She said that if Zarka wants to meet him then
[993.12] bring her here. Why can't he come here,
[997.84] is there mehendi on his feet? If he can't so what? If Zarka wants to see him,
[1005.08] I don't want to see, get me married and settle me down
[1013.74] [Music]
