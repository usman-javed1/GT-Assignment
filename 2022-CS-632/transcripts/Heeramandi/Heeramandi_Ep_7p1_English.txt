[Music] Zahira's brother-in-law Rehaan called your father and told him, "I am telling you to immediately throw him out of your house, Amma. You know her in-laws very well. You also know what kind of person Rehaan is and I have also been in love with Rehaan." [Music] [Music] Hello Amma, she was asking a lot about you, we had talked to you, yes, yes, I have talked to her, she was very happy that you have come here, and she was telling me to be careful if it is more than Zaira. I got served, so now if they had come to know that you make tea , coffee and food for me, then I would have been scolded a lot. Are you going somewhere? Yes, there is a meeting, after that go through Zahid. I will come , it will be a little late tonight, please don't mind, okay yes, I said about tea, tea is being made or the pie is getting ready, I had prepared it, it will be cold, then I would have made it and brought it [Music] [Music] [Praise] My I have nine bangles in my hands, wait a little, sir, these are compulsions, wait a little, sir, these are compulsions, we will meet now, the distance is only for one night, I am tired, Ma, you know, Javed said that he is a producer, right? He wants me in the film. This will help. The film will be shown on such a big screen in the cinema and there will be a very long recording. Hi Hi, how famous will I become. Ouch Hi Champa, please talk to your producer for me too . I am afraid because of my family that they might come to know about it. What do I do here? I will work in the film otherwise this fear will also go away. Speak slowly, even the walls have ears and if Amma comes to know then she will strangulate me. She will talk to me dear. Alas for me, first let me make my point. Well, if I get a job in a film and become a heroine, then I will be free from these poor people, but Hima is an issue, friend, and Javed says that I will have to go to Lahore for recording. Yes, you. She will go so far to Lahore without telling Amma, now she will have to go, after all this is my hobby, where will I go, there is talk of where to go, no no, Amma, where to go, where to go Amma, I have to go to become a queen, whatever she knows, can't she touch the butter, Javed She has given Lara the opportunity to get work in films and dramas. She sits all day long and watches TV. She is learning acting, not dancing. She considers herself a Sridevi and that has not been seen. She sits all day long reading magazines. Oh, you will wear so many shoes, won't you, you bitch? The ghost of all acting will be gone from your head Amma, the elder heroine, by the way, if I become a heroine, then only your name will come among the noble ones, don't talk nonsense, don't make me get your name among the noble ones, and what is that name , what is the name of that man? Javed, yes, if I step on it now, I will break that bastard's legs. Mother, I am calling you Chanda. Yes aunty, you are dying. Sit straight, heroine, press my feet and let's dance. Her legs are hurting, she is coming back from the market. My legs don't hurt [music] Where did you go? I have been worried for so long. I had gone for some work. You have come home early. Don't you have to go anywhere? Why should you go somewhere? You were asking me just like that. What is the point of getting angry in this, I am not angry, I asked you something, you did not answer , where did you go? I can't go anywhere, that's why I am asking, okay, get ready, I am also going to say the same to you. It was because you must not have cooked the food. I went out to eat the food. I had cooked the food. I am asking you to get ready because some guests are coming. Who are the guests? Not your in-laws, your in-laws . It means that some people are coming to you. Look, I have liked a girl for you, Shara, you should get married now, Amma, why does anyone marry out of fear of Baba, but you are getting married because of their fear, aren't you ashamed, why are you like this on everything? You think, after all, I am not going to stay here all my life, where will I go? You can go anywhere, I can die, so can I. And who told you to look for girls for me? Listen to me, you take the decisions of your life on the advice of people. I ca n't do it out of fear Shahram, where are you going, I have called him, I don't want to meet anyone in the evening, Himma, please pick me up, yes, come on, I am late, Oi, look who has come, wow, why have you come alone, where is the customer? When did I say that I will bring a customer? Well, we have refused to laugh, they are bringing a lot of customers. I did not tell anyone that I will bring a customer. Look, Amma came to know that if no customer comes today, she will kill me. You didn't bring me the customer, so why did he come to talk to Zeenat? Ok, you want to talk to me, tell me, what do you want to talk about, I want to talk to you alone [praise] I want to talk to you alone, what can you do [music] A, come on, tell me what is the matter [praise] [music] O come on, come on Talk to me, aren't you listening? Yes, come on , tell me, I don't have time. [Music] Won't I want to marry you ? [Music] Why marriage? Isn't he crazy to marry you? Will Zeenat love you very much? Yes, I will keep you in the car, I will give you the pleasure of wives, yes, what is that, Chanda, listen, another lover has been born, who is my lover, who made you my lover, I am not talking to you, I am talking to Zeenat, hey Hima, this is So he is talking to me, he will marry me and like Chanda, I will become the mother of his children and only one woman will be left dancing in this brothel, that is Husna Bhai Zeenat, what difference does it make, marry her, yes Chanda, do you understand this? The whole life will keep dancing like this. Come on, I am just saying a little. Come on, we will fix the date or he will also talk. So listen to me my love, what happened? You are looking at him, take this, Gagal, hey friend, it is my thing. Listen friend, I am telling you the truth, friend, let's run away from here, no one will know [laughter] I will run with you, I will run with you, look at your face, come on, come, the customer does not bring the customer, I will not let anyone bring even if no customer comes. I will break his legs, no customer will come from here, I will see who comes [laughter] Here, you are very bad, you are crazy, you want to marry me, but what happened to Zeenat, if I talked to her about marriage, you are not so much fun with her. You should have blown it away, you yourself know Amma, I will never let my marriage take place, why should I see such stories which cannot be fulfilled ? Come uncle and everything is fine tomorrow, of course son, you are fine please Maya, you have the opportunity to meet us. There is no time, we thought that we should just meet, Uncle, what should I tell you, I am so busy in work, I don't get time, you have plenty of time, you come home in the evening and are seen roaming around in the car at night, would you like to drink tea or cold water? No drink, no no, sit, I want to talk to you [Music] Yes, please look my dear, you know me very well, I am a very old friend of your father, I know your entire family, the thing that your family has earned the most is respect [ Music] Uncle, but why are you saying these things to me, son, you have forced me to say these things to you, to make you realize that you belong to a respectable family, I have the sense of intelligence, you please say whatever you want to say, you live alone. In such a situation, it doesn't feel good that you have brought Zaira and kept me there. Uncle, you know her too, you know me too, I am like a sister. Whatever I told you, there are relationships, they are not an illusion. It has been many days since we stayed with her. Earlier, there was something else. But now it is not right for this wife to stay here. Look, it was my job to make you understand, so I explained further, it is your choice, just don't forget this, son, Sholay is like a spark, uncle, thank you very much for telling me, but you guys are ours. Don't be too upset because of the reason, Allah [Music] Hafiz, stop being stubborn, my brother, stop crying, brother, he is not a butt's friend, look at the fun, he is crying, he is crying, my brother, it's good to listen, see, stubborn like a child. Don't do it friend and listen to me, Jinat will not marry you. Yes, don't do it. Why are you not able to understand such a small thing, friend? Well, listen to me for a minute , what would happen if Nath were to marry you after a while? All your life you will keep on giving me the pleasure of talking to her. O friend, wife is the one who is there for herself. Yes, oh yes, he is right. Look, even if Nat marries you, will she leave this business and what will happen when she gets inside? She must be singing and outside you must be writhing like a fish. What do you think? I will give her a job. I had told her earlier also that I only want to make her my wife and keep her at home. Just listen to me and end this debate. Friend starts, just shut up, what should I do, I should not get married, never get married, yes no, don't get married, do us a favor, oh what kind of things do you talk, friend, you are that young man, he will definitely get married, oh so how should I get it done, with whom should I get it done? Bring me yourself and give me a girl, what am I trying to do, where should I get her from, my friend, where should I get her, who will marry me, tell me, everyone will ask me, who was your father, who was your mother, what will I tell them, what will I tell them that my mother is a So I had a wife and even if I told, would he marry me? Tell me, oh my friend, oh my brother, here [music] Come here, my friend, what should I do with yours, why don't you understand that Tawaf and broker are one and the same ? We are the same, we have the same fate [Music] This Tawaf of theirs, carrying the plates of infamy around their necks , is also attached to our backs, for them these are the brothels and for us these are the brothels. I die in the shell, we die in the shell, this is our life [Music] No, I don't want to die in the shell, I don't want to die in the shell, I don't want to die here Oye Oye Bhat's O I come to her, this is it. It's done, he'll come after getting tired himself, come, I don't know, don't know, don't do anything, come, come, come, just pray and Allah will take care of me, dear friend, do something, don't help yourself, friend, don't do anything. Look, take courage, take courage, my friend [Music] Oye Vatke Oye Vatke O Yaar Chai To Gaya Oye Batka O Ba Ke O Chai, Gaya Ki Kise Mar Ga O Baat People are saying wrong. Everyone knows what is the relation between me and Shehram. They are like my younger brothers, earlier also we used to live like this, you know well, me and Shahram also did not live like this, we, these people used to live upstairs, we look below, who lives where in the Zahira house. No one can say anything about it, it is better for you that you go somewhere else, where would she go and who are you to give advice, Siyaram, don't be stupid, I have come to make Zaira understand, please take the advice from this. I'll see who takes them out, you go, please go [music] Why are you crying, what else should I do, Sir, send me, okay, you go up, why didn't he come, just like that, now you go up, tell me, I am saying. I am here, please come, I will talk to him, you go [Music] Yes, come [Music] Sit down, tell me what do you people want Shahram, what we want and you know very well, who are you, my caste, the drunkard in life, the jungle. Not me, you live in a world and in this world , it is unacceptable for a man and a woman to live together without any relationship. You are blaming a decent woman and defaming her. If the woman is so decent then why don't you marry. Do it, don't worry, I will leave this house today and will not go anywhere. You heard that she will not go anywhere because I am marrying her.
