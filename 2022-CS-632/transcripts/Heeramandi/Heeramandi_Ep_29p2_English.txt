Now she will not come to this house Murad, no way. She will come, Shumail She will definitely come in this house because she is my wife  Because she was the mother of my future child Because she is a human being and not an animal that I kick her. She is worse than animals, she is a courtesan, people hates them more than animals,  I am hating you there is no humanity in you You don't even realize that she was dying because of you Shumail, neither does she want your money nor anything else, she is even ready to serve you. You think I need her services, I will keep a courtesan in my house and let her serve me? You really think so?  You wanted a child from her? You got me married to the same courtesan. She couldn't give you a child. Where is the child, she didn't give the child, now I  will throw her away in same trash from where I had picked her up. Even you couldn't give me a child, shall I throw you too in that trash? It was you who picked her up from that garbage, not me. Yes, I made a mistake, I agree. I have made a mistake, I want to correct that mistake, I want to end everything, the child is dead, divorce her, throw her out, otherwise I will not let her come into this house, I will push her out, I will kill her.  Come and take that courtesan You have crossed all the limits, Murad, you will divorce her otherwise you will divorce me! Let me tell you one thing Shumail, I cannot leave Zarka and now I will not leave her I never realized you could be such a mean, selfish, and helpless woman, perhaps Allah showed me all this so that your reality can be revealed before my eyes. What is her reality? A courtesan? Dancing and singing? She is bought and sold? Murad wives are not bought and sold. I don't know whether you are telling the truth or a lie because I have neither seen brothel nor have I ever seen her dancing. You told me that she is a courtesan, and you are the one who told me she is a non-selling courtesan, that's it, I don't want to argue any more, now you will not take decisions about my life, I will do myself. I am going to take Zarka. Listen to me, Murad, and listen carefully, if she comes to this house, I will kill her, or I will take my life and I am not joking. [Music] But Hema you were saying that Murad is taking her home from the hospital, then what happened? Chanda Khala, when I called to talk to Zarka her number was off and Murad Brother's phone was also not reachable and Shumail started shouting as soon as she picked up the phone. She was so rude, she said take this courtesan away from here, no matter what happens, now we will not leave Zarka there. Chanda, A calamity has befallen on my daughter again. She hasn't even gotten over the shock of the child. I don't understand, when Murad himself had said this, then ... Oh, you can't understand such small thing Murad is in love with Zarka, his wife is doing this all. Lafray, you take me to my daughter, I don't know in what condition she will be. Come on, don't be mad, relax, she is Murad's wife, he will take care of her and handle this all. Habib is right, look, this is a matter between the husband and wife, you should let Murad take care of it, don't interfere. Yes mother, we should not go, if she is upset, she would have called us herself. You just relax and wait. Everything will be fine Inshallah. I don't understand these rich people.  Yes brother, whom do I want to meet? I want to go inside to meet madam. You cannot go inside, stay here, I will ask madam. Hey ... At times, they tell me to go to the hospital, and at other times, they say come home Anyways, today Zarka will be mine. If they did not give my Zarka back,  I will kill them. How did you get inside? I came to take Zarka. If you want to take her, go to the hospital, take her and then get lost. Oh, madam, send Zarka out, or it won't end well She’s not at the hospital. Your husband brought her here, and I won’t go without taking her Are you in your senses? Get out of here, otherwise I will call the police.  This is beyond your father's jurisdiction. Give our girl back, or I’ll call the police and say that you have made her disappear. Stop this nonsense. Kick him out and if he doesn't go, tell me, I will call police. Get out! Hey, don't touch me. Tell your madam, I will not go without taking Zarka. I will set this house on fire. Are going or shall I hit you? Zarka is not here. Get lost. I will hit you. Open the door. Zarka! What is her reality? Courtesan? Dancing and singing? Brothel? She is bought and sold and Murad, wives are not bought or sold. I don't know whether you are telling the truth or a lie because I have neither seen brothel nor seen her dancing. You told me that she is a courtesan and it was you who told me that she is not to be sale courtesan, that's it, I don't want to argue any more about this Now you will not take the decisions of my life, I will do it myself, I am going to take Zarka. Listen to one thing, Murad, listen with open ears if If she comes to this house, I will kill her [Music]  Not for Zarka, I am worried about Guddu.  He had gone to take Zarka, then why he has not returned yet? Habib .... don't you think, Zarka will be with Guddu? No ... I don't think so. Where has this boy gone? I don't know where he has gone, I am tired of searching and calling, he is not picking up my heart is also very worried. Habib, please go and find him. Where shall I look for him? He will come back himself.   I can't end the sorrow of my Guddu, I am sad about this. Chande, he loves  Zarka a lot. Then why was he sold her?  She loved him so much, how much she cried for him. I had explained so much to him at that time he did not listen to me. Remember what he said about her? I do not love Zarka, I will not marry Zarka, what is she? No one knows when they can fall in love. It's not a color that can be seen nor fragrance that a human can feel. It just happens. For some it happens early, for some late. Guddu came to know late; he realized later that he loves Zarka. when she left, and many people do not even whole life realize that someone is in love with them It's late in the night, you go and try to search for him. It's not too late, it's dark, he must be roaming somewhere in darkness. Must be sitting and crying   It's good, no one can see your tears in dark Today, for the first time, I have realized that Guddu is very unluck. Oh, very unlucky Anyways, I am going to look for him. Thank God you are sitting peacefully, you have become habitual to being restless. Give me slippers I will go and ask Neighbours and call him.  You recite prayers and Quran. Pari, my heart is in peace now. It's night, Murad must have taken Zarka home and he must have taken care of everything that's why madam and Zarka's call has not come yet, I have only one wish in my heart, that my daughter settles down, Mother, but it would have been better if Zarka's child had also survived isn't it? God, who had given her this child, God will give her more children too. Now I just pray to God that our Zarka gets pregnant again, relation becomes stronger because of children. Mother, shall I call her? Don't call there. You called at that time, madam had picked up, maybe the phone is still with her and what is the need? My heart has got peace., So mother, now we will never be able to meet her? Why not? A child can never be separated from their mother. Have some patience.  Murad's house situation gets better, he will let her meet us. Go to sleep, I am not able to sleep, mother, I don't know, my heart is restless Who has come at this time? Go and check. It must be mischievous Whiskey. Don't let him enter the house, Zarka? Are you okay? Everything is fine? How you are here, at this time? why are you not saying anything? What has happened to you and why is your condition is like this? Zarka? You are here? You are empty handed? Mother, let her come inside, come in. Are you alright? Where is your husband? Pari, go and see that Murad will be standing outside. He must have bought her  Come with me.   My child, are you alright?  Oh Allah, my heart is scared, what happened, Murad did not take you home? oh, what has happened with you, tell me something?  Say something? Oh Allah! My child, what has happened with you, come here and sit down, sit here Hey, what has happened to you, tell me something? Please say something, what has happened to you, Shumail said something?  You had a fight with Murad? Hey, what has happened with you, tell me something! Mother, is Murad brother is not outside. This rickshaw driver is saying that Zarka has come with him Hey, Rickshaw driver, there seems to be some misunderstanding. My daughter's husband has a very big car, why would she come on your Rickshaw. I don't know this. madam, I have brought her from the hospital. With much trouble, she explained the address to me We have been roaming around the area for three hours. I will charge Rs.1000 for it. Okay, you go, I am sending you the money. Pari go and give him the money. What kind of trouble are you in? Hey, what's the matter with you? Say something. Murad said to you something. Did you have a fight with Shumail? Say something, why you are not saying anything, what's wrong, what happened to you? O Allah, what happened to my daughter? Hey why are you silent Say something Say something   Oh Allah!
