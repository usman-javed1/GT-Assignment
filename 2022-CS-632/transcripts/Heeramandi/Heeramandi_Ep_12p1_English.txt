Somehow sweets have come to this house, he think that I will really marry him, Crazy he is crazy. I will eat sweets,  eat sweets also but first drink some milk. [ Singing ] [ Singing ]   Clap for me, I sang so well, I sang so well, Let's do again. [ Singing ] What's going on? Walikum Asalam. What you were doing Sheryar? What is this all? Musical Anklets? Check his copies, see this. Check his books, Pictures of dancers on every copy, I do not understand what kind of environment your child lives in. He was caught dancing in the class many times. Have you ever seen it yourself dancing? It dances exactly like a prostitute. He has made the whole environment dirty. The child learns a lot from the environment of his home and his locality. You first improve his environment and then send him school. This is a school, not a gimmick. Your child doesn't want to study doesn't concentrate on studies at all. There are other children in the school who also study, they also do their school work regularly. Many times have I written on the copy that I want to meet you but you did not come. He never showed me that copy, I did not even know that you wanted to meet.  More playing he dance, what are you teaching him? He brings musical anklets in School. shows dance to the children in the class. When I asked him what he is doing, he said, ' This is our business and on top of that, he says his name is not Sheryar, it's Whiskey. Just think and pay close attention if this child will do this, what effect will it have on other children? If the parents of other children come to us and ask what kind of children you are teaching our children, then what answer will we give them? Sorry, today we have removed your child's name from our school.
