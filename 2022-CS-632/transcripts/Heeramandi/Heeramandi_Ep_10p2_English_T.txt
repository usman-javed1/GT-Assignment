[0.40] Oh my, this motherfucker Mari Champa, where did she die? Hey Baba, why did you let her go?
[9.88] What did I know at the time of business? I had gone saying that I am going to the market to buy earrings,
[17.28] she has been buying earrings for three hours without any reason, what do I know? She had gone after saying for an hour that
[26.04] today I will get such news about that person that she will remember for the whole life.
[35.44] Heroine Sahiba has come and bought the earrings.
[42.24] Hey, where did Manu die? Oh, you motherfucker, shameless, where did that mother go? Hey, she is
[51.84] not going to tell me, motherfucker. With whom were you, tell me? With whom did Amma go to the market?
[58.48] With whom have I been going now? Why are you beating me? Didn't you die? It
[63.44] would have been better if you had died. If you disappear during business time, you fucking
[68.24] mother. If I had died, where would this money
[77.24] come from
[83.84] ? Well, who gave this money? She is saying again that she had not gone with anyone. She was an
[92.36] idiot. She saw my beautiful face and gave me the money. Ha ha ha, you are a very beautiful angel, didn't
[99.60] anyone see your face? And you have given the money, now go and get ready, I am going,
[105.64] I will come towards Husna now, lest she be full by the time I come, and listen,
[111.32] hurry up, don't delay, yes, I will tell you , my woe is
[116.88] this world that keeps complaining.
[120.92] It is very bad, death is better than such a life.
[128.48] What is the use of such a life in which there is neither mother nor father, all the relations are deceitful and liar,
[138.12] there is no one in this world like me, Amma said to me when I came a little late from the jar.
[146.76] I will never forgive those who have hurt my feelings, I
[154.60] will never forgive them. Hey, you had gone to meet that producer
[160.40] who had promised to make you a heroine. No, that producer is not here for a while,
[166.48] he lives in Lahore, then you. She has gone mad whenever
[172.88] she is speaking dialogues like film heroines. If Amma finds out, she will tear off your skin.
[181.40] This is a ghost that doesn't come down. Look at the weather, I wish it rains and this is not there, there is no one,
[189.56] this is this. This compulsion, this season and this distance, torment me for a moment, O your
[198.52] job worth two pillows and my monsoon worth lakhs, go away, this compulsion has become crazy, leave me,
[207.20] before you know it, get ready, Amma is about to come

[526.16] I know you are angry and I I can't leave you angry,
[538.44] I know what my crime is, only that I had
[544.44] expressed my desire to give a name to an unnamed relationship
[553.84] and I did
[561.80] not express this out of jealousy or fear of people
[567.56] . It was
[571.88] an expression of my own emotions
[575.84] and no one realizes
[580.08] when any
[584.96] emotion comes into the heart.
[594.80] I am a person bereft of love. I
[600.24] am bereft of love. I cannot express myself.
[607.80] Now
[613.12] perhaps I am so close to love for the first time in my life. This happened once,
[620.16] there was no wall of love between you and me
[627.48] and there were no forests of distance,
[634.12] it was a nameless relationship which had to get a name
[642.48] if you wanted,
[650.56] otherwise this nameless relationship still exists which I am also feeling
[657.44] and you are also feeling

[996.12] It does not happen that the fate of relationships gets broken due to change. Relationships created by man are
[1001.72] not set in stone. Yes, but relationships created by God
[1008.48] are set in stone. It was right that I used to say. And when was our relationship such that
[1014.68] it could never change?
