Amma, I am telling you that whatever has happened, it is all Chanda's fault, neither would she have become a pasani, nor would all this have happened, even now I am telling you that no matter how hard Lafda tries, the police station will not leave Chanda, no one will guard her for how long. And yes Ama, if Chanda had not slapped her then the police officer would have picked her up and taken her to Nana. Just like she used to babble before, she would still babble now. At the most, he would have pinched her like he used to do at least. Hey, shut up, I am getting worried thinking that what would happen if that human police officer took revenge, Amma, even if he took revenge, would he say anything to Chanda? Yes, do something for us. Take that Amma, look, let me explain to you, now she is not alone, she has another stomach too, oh poor Zeenat, how long will she earn for her, she has become ill, she dances a little and sits holding me, yes, what happened now? So I drank the milk, I drank it now, I know aunty, raising a child is not an easy task, you already owe me a lot, but for this I am not going to earn a favor myself, Chanda, what else can we do and then I will give it to you. He owes us less. Hey, this room is his only. I was saying that the expenses for the child would have been Rs. 100. I said no aunty, don't worry, I will dance and sing, but remember one thing, I will not let anyone come close, then only he will dance. How much will you earn by singing? Whatever you earn will be enough for us. Did n't you listen to what the DSP was saying? He was saying that he will not throw out everyone. I don't believe that these policemen, from the constable to the officer, people do not hesitate to make rounds. Oh, don't you worry about the police officer, you see, if he had wanted to do something , he would have done it, stop drinking, he will die after drinking, don't worry, listen to me, see had you not come back, otherwise you would have killed me. I love you a lot, I love you a lot, I love you a lot, you used to tell me that you won't let anyone touch you, I used to be very happy, I used to be very happy, Chand, you don't want to be sold, so I swear to God, I will sell you. I don't want you to fuck me, you marry me, haven't you gone mad? You know I love Shehram, he is my Guddu's father [Music] And that is a matter of one night, one night can be important. You lost her, you became her in one night and I, who have been in love with you for so many years [Music] I did not even think of you, love doesn't take time, love doesn't take time, it happens in a moment, how did I know that I have to fall in love with her. When he talked about marriage, I started dreaming, I will leave the area to live a decent life [Music] Lafde tell me that Chanda is really waiting for Sharam, I mean last night she was waiting for Sharam. Oh , I was waiting for someone else, of course, I was waiting, I mean, the money was to be taken from you sir, but then that other customer has come, our work is done, he has gone after paying double the money, he was an honest man, he was a very honest man. Our golden jubilee is over. Sh Ram Sh Ram Lafde, please pray that he comes back. O he has not come back, he has got married and gone away. Forget him, this cannot happen by not remembering him . I will remain sitting in his name for the whole life, don't forget. I can fuck her when you and I get married, you and I will go far away from here with our Guddu, I will get the child far away, I will work hard, I will work as a laborer, you don't like dancing and singing, neither do I, I don't like it. Do you think that I don't take you from here because I think that you will do it? That's why I didn't go from here, otherwise I would have left long ago. No, this can't be possible, I will keep doing this until Guddu grows up and doesn't start going to school. I will not keep doing it. Okay, you want to earn like Zeenat and Ma [music] You want to earn like Zeenat and Emma, ​​you want to raise your child comfortably, I will not do nonsense, I have sworn that I will dance and sing [ music] Kate Na Kate Re [Music] Doing business is not such a difficult task. Even while sitting at home, you have been my business partner since when have I become your partner. Don't be afraid, I am talking about the partnership of business, not of life [Music] And partnership in business is very easy when you feel like it, fire me, what is the need to involve me in this work [music] I am leaving, you will have to handle this business after me, I want to get you out of the suffocation of home and life [ music] If you read all these files then you will understand that life can be spent without anyone's support, not by suffocation, such a person lives for a while and then dies [music] and anyway you should not worry about anything. I am going after making all the arrangements, you will have control over everything and on top of that, Zahid is also here to help you in every matter . What will people say? Being afraid of people has become a habit of yours. Earlier you were afraid of your in-laws and now you have been afraid of your in-laws all this time. Shahra, this is not the point, I don't think that I will be able to handle all this and I am sure that you can handle all this, you try to make up your mind, just take care of yourself and do not give yourself in the hands of the world and at some point in life Even if you feel my need, just give me a call [Music] Give me a voice Get up where come Come come [Music] Sit here from today onwards [Music] Sit here Javed Look, now you don't come here Babara, you are a bastard, hasn't he told everything to Amma ? I told you that you are making me the heroine of the film. Amma got very angry and even hit me. Javed was saying, now please come here, I will break his legs, a big mess has happened, the producer was about to come, so I was going to introduce you to him. If you were going to take me to meet him, please do so and send him here, no, don't send him here now, I will come out, we will meet him somewhere outside, yes, tell me where to find him, he must have come this evening. The meeting was fixed, I was going to bring you to me, not him, I will come out of the market saying no, we will meet him again, yes, think about it, it is a sure thing, your mother will leave you, you will have to make some excuse to mother, but I will come. I will also leave from here, if anyone sees you here then I will not be able to meet you again. Look, in the evening I will do as per your wish. This is the shop of the family member, come in front of him, all of you, go [praise] [music] ] [Praise] [Music] I don't know when I will see this deep and peaceful sea again [Music] You don't feel bad coming here [Music] But I feel very strange that you are going because of me, believe me Do it, I didn't want it like this at all [ Music] Look Shahram, every relationship has a name and that name has a destiny, there is an Ehtram, it is Ehtram, it does not happen that their destiny gets broken by the end of the relationship, relationships made by humans. Yes, but the relationships created by God are lines on stone. You may be very perfect, you argue a lot, everything is your wish, you have never listened to anything of mine, what do you want to make [music], you are not going. If you like a girl there and marry her, don't be alone [Music] Stay alone, you won't listen to me [Music] [Music] [Praise] [Music] Hey my Champa Rani, she is a big heroine of films, isn't she? Sari Ikar Sahab has made this his own show, Zeba Khan Sangeeta Kavita, I did not know anything, this sir has made it a hit in his films. Hi, you have made Shivaji a heroine. Yes, she is a big heroine and now I am making a new film. I am the girl who is coming in it, ay hi hi hi extra, she was an extra, now she will become number one Ron, number one Istakar ji me bhi na me bhi, you make me a heroine like Jeva ji, speak slowly, people are watching, they will know that such a big producer is sitting. Iftekhar ji is here, now you just take me in your film, I act very well, Javed has seen my acting and asked him, I wish I could call you to my house, then you would have come and seen my acting yourself. Oh ji, she would copy Shabnam like this. People think that I am Shabnam only, Shabnam, you are much better than Shabnam, Champa ji, you have big guts, oh guts, advice, fun, acting ji, that is Aasta Bhoot, how heavy is it for you, only then you understand that You have become a heroine, there is a lot of elasticity in your body and flexibility has also increased and you know that it is very important to portray a heroine in films. What did you do? Iftikhar Saheb asked Javed, 'Dance, I do this when I dance.' So you look no less than any film heroine. Oh, just think that you have become a heroine, but for this you will have to come to Lahore. Yes, Lahore, I cannot go anywhere, so Amma does not let me go to the market. How will Lahore let me go, think about it, Champa. If sir, they make films, you want to become a heroine, then you will have to go, otherwise you and your mother are fine to become heroines, so I will leave everything. I can, I will come to Lahore, it's a sure thing, yes, it's a sure thing, it's my dream to become a heroine, I can't give up my dream, here you become a heroine, there it's raining notes on you, it's raining rain, it's raining, how good it will feel here.

Will I be able to come home without informing Amma? Amma came to know that I will leave late otherwise Amma will beat me and I am not going to let you go anywhere. I will drop you home and come back. You just keep the promise of going to Lahore and have caught the advance. If you think of Lahore then I will. I will go after all, I want to become a heroine, if [music] Ji Sadke
