[355.72] you have touched him, he has become exactly like you, may God make him pure,
[361.04] just like me. Well, it's good that I
[366.96] am a beautiful person, he is like his father, by the way, you have done well by finding the medicine for my loneliness,
[375.76] that is why I have brought it so that you can keep looking at it all day, then our child
[380.28] will be just as beautiful, our child is not crazy.
[385.76] Gaya, this is Shahram's child,
[391.88] so come on, the father is the one who raises the child, not the one who runs away. Yes,
[399.20] I will get him, I am his father, see, you will get his face too, Inshallah, he
[403.84] gets the hat from me, see. Is she like me or not? Our factory
[408.60] will export garments to them for the whole season. Yes, this is a big news.
[413.96] Abba Jaan used to say that I cannot do any work. If
[419.16] I join their factory, I will bankrupt them. Now let my first shipment go. Just
[424.48] call them and tell them, ok, I will tell them and you have to pray with me
[428.40] that I get two or four more shipments like this. I
[432.96] am just happy, okay, one
[439.52] more, oh what is this rudeness, so you tell me
[444.84] what rudeness is this. It is rather bullying Rehan, you listen to me, don't say anything,
[450.32] now the whole neighborhood tells the stories of your decency and that's what I came to see,
[455.56] who am I, why does he come here, you don't know who I am, I am
[460.80] just a person. I know that you have nothing to do with them, and you should not
[465.48] talk to them, control your tongue, otherwise what will you do, Rihan, leave her, why do you have the courage,
[470.36] forget about coming to this house, this is not your father's house, this is mine. This is father's house
[474.44] And if I step into this house in the future, I will hand him over to the police. Go, go, call the police.
[478.68] He laughs and hand me over to me. He threatens me after seeing a single woman. Shehram is yours, it
[484.68] is for Allah's sake, you are for God's sake, Shahram, please go. You leave me from here,
[488.64] I see you, what do you do, for God's sake, you go from here,
[491.84] you leave me, I will see me, S. Sheram, for God's sake, who are you
[495.48] to fight for me, go, otherwise go from here
[505.28] [ Music] I don't know what he thinks of
[521.52] himself
[525.25] [Music]
[536.04] Look, he loves me like a sister, you know me, I
[540.44] have been living in his house for eight years, he is like a younger brother, just let me live, I know I am one of these younger
[545.12] Brothers, if you ever step out of the house, see what kind of story is being spread about you.
[551.04] Thankfully, my brother is not alive. Kapka would have died after seeing your actions,
[556.36] Rehan. Why are you blaming me? I don't need you. No,
[561.36] the people of your locality are enough to accuse you and
[566.76] I know one thing that we should not be defamed because of you.
[570.48] Sign this paper and leave this house. The person because of whom you are being so arrogant should not let
[576.52] him down. I will shoot so many bullets that you won't even know why you would shoot him. It
[582.28] is because of him that you have got so much courage. I will come back after an hour. Papers
[587.32] should be signed [Music]
[591.76] [Applause] [Music]
[608.79] [Applause] [Music]
[623.76] By the way This Zeenat has gone alone, no, tests were to be done, well, her aunt and father also
[631.28] went along, I don't know what happened to
[636.28] her, her face got discolored, what is to be expected, she might have got malaria and what else might have happened,
[641.92] listen to her, take care of yourself, darling.
[651.36] I think that when I have a child, he
[657.56] will come to know that he is the son of Tawaf,
[662.24] what will
[666.32] he think, I don't want him to ever know, I want him to study and enroll
[673.48] him in an English school. Never know that he was born in a brothel.
[678.64] I don't even want him to
[686.56] stay here. There is no such place where I
[691.56] can go before the child is born. Janam, what kind of things do you talk, Chanda, the lava of this place is
[699.72] the place. If we have someone born then he will have to stay here only Chanda
[704.56] ji, for two to four years it is not possible for him to know where he was born and with whom he
[709.64] is being brought up and later on he will send him to school, there is
[713.88] no problem, if you listen to me then he should stay here. Only Pal will study and I will send
[720.68] him to school, don't worry about it,
[725.48] it's too late Zeenat and the rest did not know anything, hey, I 'll come back
[733.24] from the dispensary
[736.16] , ba, listen, give a gift to Ma, yes, give a gift to someone, but take care of yourself.
[743.08] I just left, just came [Music]
[764.11] [Praise]
[767.51] [Music]
[804.68] Why did you do it Sai? What did you do?
[810.16] How long did you have to bear the burden every day? You also had a right on that house. You
[816.20] should have fought for your rights. I can't fight the case. Had I done so, who would have gone to the court
[821.52] ? You had no faith in me. I would have supported you, I would have gone to the court. And I
[829.64] had told you to let me talk to Salman uncle. You did not even
[832.64] agree to that, there was no use Shahram, there was no use,
[839.80] leave me. No one ever gives anything to people like you, always snatches it,
[846.08] I had no place after leaving there,
[849.76] Shahram, that's why I have come here, come inside, sit and talk
[856.84] [music],
[864.76] I will not bother you much, I will just find one day.
[871.56] Why are you talking about some place,
[877.08] why there will be no room for you in such a big house, or this is the same house where you used to live, but if you stay here then I
[887.64] will consider my house more like yours, you don't know how worried I
[890.92] was for you, but seeing you. I feel as if blood relation is not a big thing,
[899.40] the relation between sorrow and happiness is the biggest. I was also coming to your house,
[906.56] I am sorry, I scolded you, come and
[915.08] sit inside, I am not sad about that, I regret only one thing. You told
[921.56] me not to talk to Rihaan, you don't know him, Shahram, he is an ill-mannered man,
[926.92] you should have allowed a fight with him, I am not afraid
[932.64] of him, it is only because of you that I have left him, otherwise he would have misbehaved. Well , whatever
[937.28] had to happen has happened, now you
[942.76] forget everything, there is no need to go anywhere, you just stay here, he
[949.40] is not so important that he can come here, he has no trust, Shahram, just don't mess with me. Now even
[956.12] I am not in trouble. Yes, if he tries to misbehave with me, I
[961.40] will not leave him.
