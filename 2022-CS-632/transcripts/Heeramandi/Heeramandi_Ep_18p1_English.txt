I am very sorry for whatever happened, I have even scolded Whiskey a lot, ask him. I have already apologised, now leave me. Auntie forgive me too, I made a mistake I should have not misbehaved with Rani. My dear, that's why they say think before speaking, Forgive her, this happens when people live together. Zarka, I have cooked curry and rice today, you eat with us today, Call  Hema Auntie also upstairs. That's a wonderful plan. You all stay here, I am coming in two minutes. [Song] [Song] Are you crazy? Earlier I had a little doubt that you are mad, now I am sure that you are  mad. Hey Lafrah, you are absolutely right, I have gone mad, luck has suddenly been kind to me, I will play with money, what is going to happen, it should happen once, I am going. Hey, you have been dreaming all your life. He is talking big things, saying that I will bring customers for you from abroad. Hey, you leave him, he talks big things and these days, he is asking Chanda and me to leave this place and shift in  bungalow, now you tell me, does anyone leave his old place? If the new place is good, then one should leave the old place, one should bring changes in life t gain progresses in life. Now  will shift in bungalow. New customer, glamour in life, you will get a new car, I mean ....Serve me tea. I know, you are not going to go without drinking the tea. By the way, Hema Bai you are looking very good, Lafray, you are still lascivious. I am a man and man is always a lascivious , I am bringing you, have patience. By the way,  you still look young.   How is this looking? Very nice. Let me do this straight. Wow Rani, you have good make up skills. Zarka is looking pretty.  It's not my skill. Zarka is already very pretty. Then let's compete with Zarka today. Mother and Zarka, think that I only know English dance but I can also show them what I know and you know on which song I will dance? Which one? Okay, I will also dance on this song and will beat you. It is going to be a lot of fun while dancing, Okay then let's do it! Okay! Hey Chanda, today I will make Punjabi cuisine Mother, I have bought a unique customer, which you never thought about.  Guddu .... Come Madam Asalam alikum. Walikum aslam. Mother, she wants a girl. Guddu, you are crazy. Is this a customer? She wants a girl? Madam, I had told you that in our place girls only dance and sing. Yes, but I don't want to make them dance and sing. I told you that. I know Madam. Pari, Zarka, Rani ... Come out Guddu, you are in your senses? You know that we do not sell girls. I will tell you everything, Quickly, come here, Madam, you can select from them [music] What is your name? Zarka! Guddu, tell me clearly what is going on? Mother, I will explain everything, you go inside, go to Mother's room, go, Go now. What has happened to the whiskey? Hey, in today's times, anything goes. How she was asking my name? What is your name? And you said in style ... Zarka Keep quite. Now you are gone. By the way she was looking very weird, I don't know, Whisky will tell. Let Whisky come, then I will ask him I know that you people do not sell you daughters, that is why I have come here. Sorry Madam, I forgot, you sit, then we will discuss. Please sit. Mother, you also sit  What I am trying to tell you has nothing to do with what you are thinking. Please forgive me Madam but, the person who comes here is concerned with only one thing, whether you hold the ear from here or from there the matter remains the same.  I belong to a noble family. All the people who come here call themselves from a noble family. What are you doing Mother? She is not an ordinary lady, she is a very big lady, please listen to her first. Please continue I have come here due to compulsion. Okay, tell me. I am listening I want a child and I want to take one girl from you. What are you saying? Do you understand the meaning of this? The same bad deed, we don't like. Mother, you sit and listen to the whole thing. No bad deed, I will get the girl I like married properly. Jewellery, clothes, everything will be there till the child is born  she will be our responsibility but after the child is born, we will divorce her and we will take the child and go away from here. And what will you tell people that the child is born in your house? Yes. Why don't you adopt someone else's child? We wanted to adopt someone else's child, but I just didn't feel like it. A person wants his own child to raise. I think your husband tried to amuse you. But actually he want to marry again. Whatever, if you all agree, then I am ready to give up to Rs 5 lakh for this work, the expenses, jewellery, are all apart from this, there will be nothing that is illegitimate.  The work will be done in the right way, But the girl you have liked is my son's ... She is the daughter of our Hema Khala, I will get you to talk to her, don't worry, I will convince her that it will be done, you go Madam, after doing everything, I will call you. Guddu? Mother, Madam is getting late. We will talk later. I am taking with me the belief that you all will understand my helplessness. I will be waiting for your reply. Whoever the girl belongs to, if you wish, you can convince her. Yes Madam, I am saying, I am here, everything will be done, you just relax. I can even give 10 lakhs for this work, Madam, your work is done. Guddu, listen to me. He has gone crazy. 10 lakhs! Jewellery and clothes apart, you can also get 5 lakhs as dowry too. Don't talk nonsense, Whiskey, don't you feel ashamed while talking about me For your fiance? Hey, how did you even think like this? Should I sell the girl? Hey Auntie, this is not selling. This is selling. You are selling me for clothes, Jewellery  and Rs10 lakhs. Mother, I am ready for marriage, he is getting married, and divorce is not a big deal? This happens to girls all the time. You stupid girl  he is getting married, he will not make a wife, and when he has a child, he will keep her too and will kick you out. Hey Whiskey, I am asking how did you even think like this.  We don't want this type of money. Auntie, I swear our days will be filled with money, don't you know? I keep driving rickshaw all day in the sun. Look for customers daily, and they give Rs 50,100 or 200  Neither you people can survive on this nor we. How is our situation will cahnge Aunty , tell me, You will change the situation by selling me? It's not selling, you will get married. Then there will be a divorce, you will marry a divorce girl? [Music] [Music] Allah is merciful. people who don't need, they are blessed with many children and those to whom he has given so much wealth depriving for child. What would happened if this woman also gets child? It is a game of nature, only God knows better. Here, no one gets what he wants . And God gives everything to those who don't want it. Now see, here we manage money to feed the girls, on the other hand Madam, no one in her house will even know how much wealth they have. I am angry with Guddu. How did he bring that woman here? Why didn't he refuse her? How he can be so mean? And look at that woman, she select only our Zarka Tell me one thing Chanda, Do you think Hema will agree? I don't know what she is thinking. But If she agrees, she will make a big mistake and will regret it later. [Music] Rani, do you know what my heart says? My heart says that if there is one sensible person in the whole place, is only you  You will do my work? Try to convince Zarka, You know I will not marry her and that bitch is refusing only because she thinks of me as her fiance. Why are you talking so mean? You had persuaded me that you are her fiance and you love her. Hey, I had said this  to save my life, you know, the day before yesterday when I went to Madam's house and she had told me the whole thing about what she want, since then I was thinking that how will I convince her And this was the only way to convince her and see how ungrateful she is , I am explaining that no one can earn this amount by staying here as she is getting with this work, everyone will be blessed. You are sensible, you try to explain her. No whisky, I don't think that she will agree But you can talk to Lafrah, if he convinced Hema Auntie, then Zarka will agree. You are absolutely right. I said the only intelligent person in this whole place is you. I am going to talk to Lafrah. Lafda will go and talk to auntie. And listen, if she disagree with Lafrah, then you will talk for me. Yes, okay, I will talk. [Music] Think sensibly. Let me tell you one thing clearly, Guddu will never marry your daughter. This is such a big offer. You will never get this again in life. You will marry one daughter and the other's dowry will be ready. How can you talk like this? Hey, he will divorce her and take the child. Hey, does any woman ever sell her child? Who knows whether she will give birth or not? Courtesan never sold her child. All the illegal babies belong them. This child is not  illegal and as far as divorce is concerned Girl should have this much strength that she keeps him in control, if she takes good care of him  he will never leave her. You have two daughters, you have fed your sisters and brothers all your life. Now you are raising girls, you will do this all your life? You can't save money remember one thing, no one will give name to your daughters You are right, but this .... It would not be wrong to do this. Why did Zeenat die from AIDS? Because the marriage took place very late, the marriage was done earlier, she could never get AIDS. And the last thing if you want to agree otherwise I will consider that I have fulfilled my duty. Thing is after sometimes your girls will be fed up with this all and they start prostitution. Then don't tell me You are right, but I can't talk to Zarka, someone else should talk to her. You talk to her. If she agrees, then okay I am agree. Okay, I will talk to her. where is she? She went to market. Okay Thank God, you got my point.
