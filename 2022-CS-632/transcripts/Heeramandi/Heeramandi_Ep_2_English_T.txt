[33.08] Damn on your face Lafra. Damn on your whole generation
[39.56] [ Song ]
[53.76] What you did without asking me? You made a deal of Chanda, and didn't even tell me,
[60.04] you cheated me. Don't talk nonsense. Chanda told me to do
[66.72] So I did. What answer will I give to the police  officer?
[72.00] Don't you remember what he said? That Chanda is only mine. Who the hell he is. 
[80.00] He will not pay anything for her. I have brought a good customer. 
[84.96] He is giving 10000
[90.20] 10000? Yes. Did you bring him under the influence of drink?
[97.24] Do you know, that we don't talk with customer when we are drunk.
[103.92] But that princess was not ready to go with anyone.
[108.92] When and how did she talk to you? Actually Chanda got
[115.56] was scared of police officer and she said to me to bring a customer. The second thing is that this
[121.84] customer is a fool, he is a very simple man. He is not like our regular customers.
[127.32] Chanda, is not an ordinary girl. Remember Lafray, If I 
[137.44] don't get this 10000, I will take away your life, I will not leave you. Okay
[144.44] By the way, listen to me too, what happened to my commission, from Zeenat's customer
[150.84] Husna Bai?
[156.22] [Music] 
[167.27] [Music] 
[182.40] No, I don't want money, I had vowed not to sell myself,
[189.20] now if I take the money, my whole life will be counted by itself
[193.22] [Music]
[198.76] I am sorry
[202.56] I really had no idea that you don't want all this,
[210.48] My friends told me that this is your business 
[216.29]  I'm sorry I'm really very sorry
[225.44] What happens by saying sorry? Dreams of my dead mother go back to the same way by saying sorry?
[232.36] that I will
[237.92] never sleep with any customer
[241.20] and the first man to touch me will be my husband
[249.16] I wonder, how I will face my dead mother
[256.82]  Are you getting 
[261.08] married? Who will marry me?
[266.60] Decent girls get married to decent boys only
[274.41] [ Music ]
[296.54]  
[304.56] Will you marry me?
[311.16] Take this, buy toothpaste for yourself,
[318.88] Don't have money till come here.
[323.59] Give me. Mother, please tell Lafrah that next time don't bring
[331.16] poor and wretched people otherwise he will not get his commission. 
[333.72] Okay, I will say. Shall I tell you something
[336.76] You will be surprised. Why? Are you getting me married? Go away, 
[344.52] Someone has just left from Chanda's room. Are you sure? What was the need for me to lie?
[354.41] He will pay 10k. What 10k? Yes. How much did she give you? Nothing yet.
[360.96] He left the room and she closed the door. No problem, I
[366.96] will take it in the morning, It's her first earning, let her be happy. Okay, I am going to sleep,
[372.76] don't wake me up. You should not be home at this time? Your
[377.40] Parents must be waiting for you. Because of these actions of yours, they
[381.24] are angry with you. Kulsoom aunty has called twice and asked if Shehram
[385.44] has come here. Do you have any idea of ​​someone's problem?
[391.16] Where were you? 
[395.88] You won't get any coffee at this time. Anyway, the coffee is finished. Go home.
[401.28] I want to talk to you. Well, you have tongue in your mouth. Then
[408.84] tell me, what is your excuse? What happened? Because of friend's wedding
[414.48] you forget your family? Or all four tires of the car punctured or is your friend in the hospital?
[418.72] Nothing like this happened.
[424.84] I came
[428.20] to talk to you about my marriage.
[435.04] About marriage?
[438.84] Thank God that you thought about marriage. Your poor parents
[445.28] have come from America in this interest of marrying you and
[448.20] take both of you along from here. I will not go to America. You know
[455.08] how much Bahram Brother hates me. No brother can hate his brother. Everyone wants your well being.
[459.56] The whole world is thinking about my well being. I am enough for myself
[464.08] Okay, don't go to America but tell this good news to your mother. She
[469.04] has confirmed your engagement to Atiya. I don't want to marry Atiya.
[472.68] Then who will you marry?
[481.20] There is a girl. Who is she? Tell me. You don't know her. Tell me her name,
[492.84] Chanda. Who is Chanda?
[504.56] she is
[511.72] a courtesan
[515.60] Your mind has gone wrong? You will marry a courtesan? And your parents
[522.48] will agree? Where did this courtesan suddenly come from? Till yesterday,
[527.56] there was nothing like this. That's why, I have come to you. You tell my parents.
[534.12] You have lost your mind, I will go and talk to your parents,
[539.84] That you have to marry some courtesan and they will give you permission? they
[545.24] listen you more than me. You can convince them. Go to your home and tell this to your parents yourself.
[551.84] I don't have the courage to say such a ridiculous thing. Sister, you know ... I know nothing
[557.60]  I am feeling ashamed to think that you have started going to such places,
[564.00] only this was left, you have done this too.
[570.20] Go from here. 
[583.44] Hey Lafry, you don't wake up very late these days. Leave it,
[591.48] tell me why do you bring flowers in the morning. Your work starts at night. You
[597.40] don't know anything about flowers, they are not available in the evening. We buy in morning,
[603.72] keeping them fresh till the evening is my art, you don't know about flowers. The
[610.96] flowers that live here, they are enough for me, this Champa, Chambeli
[616.16] Yasmine, they are enough to make my life difficult. 
[622.00] Love birds are sitting here. Getting massage in the morning. Okay khan enough
[629.24] your work will be done. Where were you Lafra last night? He was guarding Chanda's
[636.36] brothel. Robbers were coming there? Don't talk nonsense, bring smoke for 
[643.88]  I will give you such energetic thing that you will become a rocket,
[650.48] but there is one condition. What is the condition?
[656.64] Get me married to Zeenat Amaan
[662.59] Have you gone mad?
[668.40] Courtesan don't get married. I am not talking about that marriage, I
[676.12] am talking about the marriage certificate which they make to escape from the police.
[682.04] I am trying to protect Zeenat Amaan's future. What if any new
[686.84] police officer come, than I can say Zeenat Amaan is my wife 
[692.76] Have you seen your face? She will not marry you, she will not even do fake marriage with you,
[700.32] she will hit you on the head with shoes. I am not talking to you Phoolan
[705.24] I am talking to Lafra. If he wants, he can do anything, friend
[711.04] he himself has married twice. This is just a paper, please get it made.
[717.40] Okay ...Promise? First give me smoke,
[724.72] making promises in the morning. I will give you such a thing that you will become an aeroplane and
[730.52] will directly reach Dubai

[749.27] [Music]
[754.62]  [Music]
[770.80] Chanda 
[776.88] Mashallah Mashallah, you are glowing
[786.92] This is what life is, now you have realised how beautiful life is. 
[795.04] Mashallah Mashallah, you are glowing. Get up and look in the mirror.
[803.28] Mother, definitely she will glow now. Stop Zeenat Amaan, don't tease my daughter. 
[809.64] Look What have I brought for breakfast? There is jam, there is butter, there is milk,
[816.80] I also ordered fruits. After some time, eat fruits also. Go, get up, wash your face and
[824.20] have breakfast. I just want to drink tea. Okay, sit down. Zeenat will make tea. Zeenat Amaan, I
[832.80] have kept water on stove go quickly and make tea for Chanda. Okay, bringing
[840.00] Chanda...
[856.64] then how much money did he give?
[861.40] Lafra was telling that the deal was done for Rs 10000. By the way, 10k is less 
[870.24] You are worth selling in lakhs. 
[873.68] If I was at your place, would have never agreed for 10,000? Well, leave
[883.64] come on, give me money.
[889.48]  I have not taken the money. What are you saying? You have not taken the money.
[896.76]  If you had told me, I would have made him pay every single penny. I didn't let him get down until
[902.80] he pay in full. He had given me the money, but I didn't took.
[910.16] What and why didn't you take the money? Because I don't want to be sold. Hey,
[918.00] have you gone mad? What happened mother? Why are you shouting? I am cursing my fate.
[922.60] Leave me alone. Get out of my room 
[929.84] Let's go Zeenat, I will extort every penny from Lafrah otherwise my name is not even Husna
[936.68] This audacity of yours, that you stand under my roof
[943.68]  and tell your mother the story of your and a 
[949.40] courtesan and force us to accept your decision.
[957.16] If you fall in love with that woman, remember one thing. I will never hand over my future generation
[968.52]  to that woman. Not at any cost
[974.52] Before I lose my cool I want you to leave the house
[983.48] What are you looking at? Get out. Mehmood?
[989.44] Just get out of here. Get the hell out of here.
[998.68] Here all these women look the same. Lafray 
[1003.80] come here. Shall I come Husna Bai? Get lost! I am talking to Lafrah, Come up
[1013.24] I want to talk to you. I am coming in a minute. Come quick.
[1019.36] coming just in a minute. What do you think
[1025.20] that only girls should be looked at? How did I know that this boy is like this?
[1031.52]  
[1036.04] No one knows the future. Even if you had come to know, what would you have done?
[1042.88] Because of these apprehensions 
[1050.04] it is said that one should keep a close eye on the child.
[1055.00]  I will not stay here anymore, leave him on his own. 
[1060.64] listen to me Mehmood, he is not sensible, he is stuck in a quagmire, if we
[1066.80] leave him like this, then he will be ruined. Don't say anything. What do you think
[1073.92] he will improve if we stay here?
[1077.88]  what's the matter?
[1079.88] You are looking very angry. Whom did you bring yesterday? A customer
[1085.32] What happened? Did he run away with the Chanda? Who would run away with someone like her?
[1089.72] You had made a deal of Rs 10,000, right? Give me 10000. Oh yes yes take 10000
[1097.00] Take from Chanda, he must have given it to her. Ask for my commission from her. You are a liar
[1102.92] Chanda refused, She didn't get any money. What are you talking about. Chanda did not take money?
[1107.56]  Hey Chanda, come here. What's the matter?
[1115.84]  You did not take money from customer?
[1121.36] No. Why?
[1126.64] No one takes money from their future husband
[1130.52] Have you gone mad, what do you think,
[1136.48] will he marry you?
[1142.08] Why are you not understanding me. She is not a courtesan. Uncle has thrown you out of the house for right. You
[1147.68] are a stupid man, you don't even think that if you take her out of the house as your wife,
[1152.92] then you will find 10 such men who would have seen her dancing and singing.
[1158.76] Life does not end with that one woman,
[1164.48] I will show you such courtesans that you will be astonished and
[1170.68]  is she going to marry you? After marrying you, her business will be ruined, she will
[1176.04] not do business. Why aren't you guys listening to me seriously?
[1179.88] Okay. Tell me.
[1185.96] Well , when I went to her room,
[1191.16] she started crying. She told me that she doesn't want all this.
[1197.20] She didn't even take money from me. They take money for spending the night there, right?
[1202.24] She didn't take money from you because she has confirmed you. This is their business. They
[1207.32] traps someone in their net. That poor guy
[1211.00] keeps bearing her expenses for four-six months. No Zahid, you don't know
[1217.12]  what I have seen in her eyes was not at all like what is in the eyes of courtesan,
[1222.12] you guys don't want to support me, don't do
[1228.20] I came here because you guys are my friends, you will support me, get me married to her
[1233.08] I have made a promise to her that I will come back. And I will definitely fulfil this promise,
[1238.12] you understand
[1243.96] I am no more a Courtesan. Why? You have wings now?
[1252.88] Maybe, and if it doesn't come out, then they will come out soon.
[1259.88] If you are back from your dream than listen, after three days, Sultan Khan's has Program at his house
[1266.60] Mother said that you will go too. I won't go, Why? Why you will not go? This is
[1275.52] the drama that you do, and now that is over. The night
[1281.92] which you had saved for so long has passed away
[1286.15] [music]
[1289.40] I said I will not go
[1295.72] Just watch, I will send her. We will marry him and settle him,
[1302.24] but he is trapped in very bad company and look at me, I have committed
[1310.00] to Khadija. What should I say to her and your father is very upset.
[1317.56] Your father says that he will not stay here even for a minute,
[1321.48] go back to America immediately, but
[1325.08] what should I do, I can't leave my son here
[1331.32] and I know that he will never come to America.
[1337.00] He is also my child
[1342.47] [Music]
[1349.64] Hello yes son, Stay blessed.
[1356.04]  now it's decided that we are going back 
[1361.08] No, instead of trying to explain to me, you yourself understand
[1365.92] that you do not have any brother 
[1370.04] He has fooled you without giving money, he wiped his hands silently and
[1379.36] Shut up. He put bundle of money in front of me. It was I who did not take it.
[1384.84] Well, if he had promised to marry you, then why he was giving you the money?
[1391.24] So I can give to Husna Auntie, he said this while giving money.  
[1397.28] They will ask for money from you but I
[1401.52] was not going to take it. I don't know when I became so close to him. He 
[1407.76] was a very decent man and yet very vicious. Next time he comes, please
[1416.16] get him to talk to Champa. Don't talk nonsense about him, I just told you that he is my future husband,
[1426.36] husband, husband sounds so strange, doesn't this word sound like
[1431.68] 'Vodka' and 'lafrah' are being mentioned. In the papers they are our husband.
[1438.64] This is only way to escape from the law, Chanda, in this way you will be saved from the law,
[1444.92] Maybe he is also thinking like Lafrah and Vodka. If you both
[1449.88] want to do this kind of nonsense, then get away from here, I don't want to talk to you, Oh
[1454.04] Chanda, look what I bought for you. He wants to talk to you, Chanda ji. Why is this the
[1461.64] time, this is not the time for business, not even dancing or singing. Zeenat Amaan is not here,
[1468.36] I have tried to make him understand but he wants to talk to you. Why? 
[1473.84] I don't want to talk. Get lost. Wait, don't send him back. We are here to serve
[1480.80] Come handsome, let's go. Lafray, who you bought?
[1488.60] who has brainwash our Chanda? Take her to an exorcist.
[1493.72] Oh my! What happened?
[1501.40] What happened to you? Whose words are you believing?
[1507.56] These kind of people come and have this kind of dialogues. They say that when these people come,
[1512.12] they want to trap people like you so that people like you can feel their own.
[1518.00] These are ways to trap people and there is nothing else. It is not like that, I also
[1525.72] see them every day,  I recognise the lust in their eyes. Shehram was not a customer, he had
[1533.16] come due to the jokes and taunts of his friends.
[1537.24] Look, he has given me a ring. Take it off, it
[1542.92] is a manly ring. No Lafray, this is his promise when he had promised,
[1548.64] he will come back then gve it to me and I will wait for him all my life
