[0.52] If a child is born then how will she abandon the child? It's a money game
[7.08] she is doing everything for the sake of money. I don't think so
[12.36] Anyway, a woman is the one who keeps even an illegal child close to her heart. She
[18.48] will leave her halal child there? Chanda, you are not sitting in the brothel, you are sitting in the well.
[25.96] You are a saint, you don't know what is happening around. Now a days mother through their children in well
[34.60] and runs away. No mother does this. They do this. Mother do this, I myself is example
[43.52] My mother left me in the garbage. Dogs were going to eat me. Some decent man picked me up and
[49.68] took me to his home. After a month, he also left
[55.16] me in the brothel. Now you understand?
[61.64] Be thankful that Zarka's child will be raise in a good family environment
[70.87] [Music]
[80.84] Hey Lafray, I am going to market to buy one new suit for myself, one
[87.24] gift for Zarka and one a dress for my mother, tell me, do you want anything?
[92.52] I don't want anything. At least wear something nice today. My earnings are not
[97.12] illegal. I don't want anything. Hey, why are you behaving rude?
[103.12] Looking, someone is getting married for the first time in this brothel
[108.60] Go and see they are starting function upstairs.
[111.08] By the way Lafrah, your luck did not support you, otherwise you would have done this long time ago.
[117.68] By convincing my mother. Hey, get lost you bastard!
[122.28] otherwise I will kill you. Hay, lafrah mind it. lafrah uncle mind this!
[128.28] Just wait .... Lafrah Uncle
[133.36] I will not spare you ... Lafrah uncle!
[139.40] Hey, come back! Calling his father uncle.
[144.88] I use to think that my girls get married and now they are getting married, the house is also getting settled,
[153.88] but to get destroyed. Don't think like this. Just pray that her house gets settled,
[163.48] My only prayer is that her house gets settled
[167.63] [Music] 
[171.07] Listen, stick to your promise,
[177.28] it is certain that sorrows are always in the foundation of our brothels,
[184.80] That is why I am scared, weird things are coming in my mind, I don't
[192.28] know whether her house will settle down or not? I don't know what will happen. 
[195.28] Murad will keep her happy or not?
[199.32] Don't think wrong, Inshallah, whatever happens will be good. This is the wedding house, and you are looking sad,
[206.64] Come on, smile now.
[212.44] This is the only song or are there more?
[217.04] There are more,. We have seen only one. Hey, what's going on, feed me some sweets too,
[222.60] Where were you? I had gone to buy a gift. Go and get a chair for yourself.
[233.23] [Music]
[239.09] Hey, look, I have brought a gift for you,
[246.00] I don't want anything, Hey, you are still angry? Look Zarka, whatever I did, is
[254.00] for your good fortune. Don't talk nonsense,
[257.84] whatever you did was to keep your money intact,
[261.96] you got your money, isn't it enough,
[269.96] It means you are not happy? Not your concern, I am happy or not. 
[278.04] Zarka, you can't understand right now what I have done, but later you will know that
[282.44] I have done best for you.
[285.32] If you are angry, stay angry, but keep my gift,
[293.72] I said, I don't want anything,
[300.32] I don't want to keep any memory of your's with me. You have gone crazy!
[312.48] [Music]
[325.66] [Music]
[334.44] How did you go there? Do you have any idea about that place?
[340.48] A woman like you cannot even think of going to that dirty place,
[344.68] men think before going there and you went there without thinking about it. Now
[350.60] it is not that dirty place and then those people do not make their daughters do any wrong work,
[356.52] This is what you are telling me, remember once I too had gone to the same place where
[364.88] you went today and what you said to me? If you go there even now, I
[371.08] will react in the same way. And you yourself went to those dirty streets to those dirty women
[377.00] for this stupid idea, by the way, where did you get this stupid idea from?
[383.12] This idea is disgusting. Is this justified to do to get a child?
[389.80] First marry a courtesan and then
[396.56] give birth to a child from her and adopt child. No matter how many people the courtesan has been with,
[402.08] She will not go there until the child is born. And with how many people she has been before?
[407.84] Is it easy to accept the child born to such woman?
[416.40] Nikkah will make that child legitimate, Shehram. And anyway, every person
[423.16] accepts his legitimate child with great pride, no matter courtesan gives birth to him. Whatever, I
[429.36] will not allow you to do this work.
[432.52] Now too much has happened, Shehram, the matter has gone too far,
[438.48] No matter how far the matter has gone, I will not allow you to do this work.
[443.24] Now it is your choice, you keep my words or!
[451.16] After coming back, the office problems are not yet solved, Now
[456.24] the problems have started at home. I just told you that I
[460.08] will not allow you and you will not go there. No, Shehram
[466.52] Shehram is very angry. He is not ready to listen to this, leave having a child, I don't understand
[471.36] how I will convince him, he is very upset with the fact that I 
[477.12] I went to those women in the dirty streets. I can understand
[481.88] why he is thinking like this, that is why I am finding it even more
[486.72] difficult to explain to him. Yes, now tell me what should we do?
[495.32] This is right. Yes, maybe he understands your point. Okay, yes
[501.72] He is at home at night. Yes, dinner time, okay
[507.68] [Music]
[521.56] [Song]
[532.16] [Song]
[540.80] Oh my prince, stay blessed!
[546.56] Here, open your mouth, eat well. 
[556.72] Mother see what I have brought. I enjoyed shopping so much. Greetings Auntie
[563.04] Greetings, Look, Auntie, I have taken these as per my choice
[569.56] look how beautiful these sandals are.
[574.52] Very good, very good, Hema Auntie, this is of my choice, how pretty it is? It is
[580.40] very nice. It will look nice on Zarka. Very nice colour. Mother, I have seen a dress, it
[585.56] is so beautiful, just give me 2000 more for that,
[589.40] Hema Auntie, where is the Zarka, I will show her me these clothes. Hey, wait, she is sleeping,
[596.08] show her later. Mother, I have brought something for her also. Show me, this one
[601.88] is matching with this one. It is very beautiful, now don't show her now, let her wake up
[607.64] Then show her in the evening.
[625.44] Asalamalaikum, come ...
[630.60] How is his mood? Come sit, Asalamalaikum. Walikum asalam. I think that
[638.96] have come at the right time.
[650.56] What's the matter, today you are ignoring me. I think I
[655.76] have disturbed you all by coming. No, it's not at all like that,
[659.84] eat the food, give her plate, please
[664.44] I already have a plate in front of me. Then start.
[676.52] I have come to meet you only,
[699.40] I know.
[703.32] Then you must also know why I came.
[709.65] I don't know whether you agree or not, but
[719.56] I feel that
[724.12] without children, life is exactly the same as
[727.66] the way we
[734.72] are sitting around this table and we are not able to understand
[739.96] what to talk about, how to start, how to communicate.
[749.28] You might not agree with the point because you are a man and
[755.36] can live without many things but perhaps a woman cannot do this.
[763.00] Are women born to have children only? I am not saying this but
[770.04] any woman cannot consider herself complete until she has a child in her womb.
[780.20] Why, Zaira, don't you consider yourself complete?
[785.08] In that life in which only me and you are present and
[791.16] there is no one else left. I became complete the day you held my hand,
[795.68] man. I need the company of a person, I have got that company
[802.72] The life of both of you is very different from the life of me and Murad,
[810.84] we both live under the same roof and keep searching for each other
[820.12] There is no one  in your life, but I have my in laws in my life
[827.80] There are questions in their eyes and these questions 
[835.08] cross my body, they wound me. My mother-in-law's desire, wounds my soul,
[843.32] insecurity surrounds me all the time. Don't know
[851.40] how long Murad and I will stay under one roof, don't know which
[857.68] moment will be the last moment between us.
[862.20] Will you tolerate a courtesan in your house? Yes, I will do it because I
[870.84] will keep her as a woman and a mother and not as a courtesan.
[877.44] In my house 
[884.72] You can see your husband under the same roof with a courtesan in another bedroom?
[891.84] Yes I can see because she is a courtesan
[898.72] or not from a good noble family, that later she becomes a compulsion for my husband.
[903.60] She is a woman with whom my husband is not ready to spend even one night, he
[908.44] cannot even think of spending his whole life with her. Do you think that
[911.96] your husband will accept that courtesan? This is the problem, that is why I
[918.08] need the help of both of you. Please, only two of you, apart from both of you,
[924.64] there is no one so close to me who can help me in my legitimate or illegitimate matters,
[929.24] on whom I can trust. Please, I need the help of both of you
[935.80] to convince Murad till the child comes in my lap, please. Will your in-laws
[942.76] accept the child born from courtesan?
[946.60] They will not know anything, they do not live in this country and
[951.68] what happens in my and Murad's life in a year and a half
[956.04]  They won't know. Please!
