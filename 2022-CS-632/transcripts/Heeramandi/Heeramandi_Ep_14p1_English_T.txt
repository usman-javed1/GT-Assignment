[3.04] I don't know how Zeenat would be, she even eat anything or not?
[7.57] Don't worry, 
[15.56] I made chicken broth and shami kebab for her, you take it with you. Maybe she will eat.
[22.56] Auntie, I have come to go to the hospital with you, Chanda has already visited
[29.32] Okay Auntie, you take her. Okay, you get ready, I tell Lafrah
[36.20] to stop the taxi. Auntie, I am very sorry that doctor has said
[42.64] that Zeenat is not going to survive. Why are you talking nonsense? You are blabbering
[48.68] without thinking about whom to talk to. It doesn't matter Chanda,
[54.44] now it doesn't matter, ask a mother's heart,
[61.04] what is she going through. Seeing her child go in front of her,
[69.72] Life and death are in Allah's hand. Maybe our Zeenat recovers.
[74.56] she gets better. See who is here. You bought her home?
[83.32] Dr allow her to go? Doctor said
[88.92] that she will be fine in a few days, she will run,
[105.60] Vodka, why did you bring her home?
[109.60] Shall I leave her to die in hospital? 
[116.72] Doctor said take her home,
[122.80] there is nothing left in her.
[127.00] At any time 
[141.20] How come Shehram? How did uncle and auntie die?
[147.64] why didn't you tell me?
[153.64] what should I tell you? What could you have done,
[158.60] They
[162.28] met with an accident.
[167.80] You went there?
[176.96] When I reached there, Baba Jaan was conscious,
[189.20] but mother
[195.04] How do people pass from among us and we do not even realise,
[207.00] Still we do not value people. 
[213.04] After their death we realise what we have lost
[221.08] and what gained.
[233.44] You know,
[237.72] I could not sleep peacefully there even for one night, I
[244.84] just kept thinking that you are alone.
[250.69]  
[262.04]  I was not alone. Saeeda Auntie was with me.
[269.88] you were alone.
[274.80] I am still alone
[284.04] I am no longer the old Shehram,
[288.88] I can get my point across
[295.16] and I have come with a decision that
[303.76] I will not live alone,
[312.00] Tell me what happened? Our Zeenat is leaving us,
[318.72] Where is she going? She is sick, in the hospital. She
[325.76] is leaving the world. She is dying,
[334.88] She is going to God. People die when they grow old, Zeenat can't die,
[344.12] Do one thing. You marry her, she won't die. she won't
[351.40] I will marry her, yes, I will marry her, she
[358.20] should get some happiness,
[362.00] but what will I do if she dies?
[367.88] How I will live without her. Don't cry Vodka
[371.44] We will pray, she will be fine. 
[378.75] Lafray, Get me married to Zeenat. No dear,
[393.56] you will die. Have you gone mad? Yes, I am mad.
[401.44] Get me married to her, I want to give her some happiness. 
[408.20] who knows, may she get saved. Maybe she get's courage by new life, may
[416.24] she get the hope of living, who knows. I beg to you.
[424.20] hold your feet, friend. What happened to you my dear. 
[433.77] Please get me married. For God's sake.
[441.36] How this can be possible, Lafrah? Think yourself, have gone crazy 
[447.20] Everything is possible. The biggest thing is that it
[454.24] can happen because of Vodka's luck. Maybe Zeenat survive. He is right
[460.20] In this way, Vodka's wish will be fulfilled. Our Zeenat
[466.16] Will take one happiness with her.
[472.48] Zeenat is dying but why do you guys
[479.08] want to kill Vodka?
[482.84] If he marry's Zeenat, then he will also catch this disease.
[488.52] Don't worry about him, he knows everything,
[494.00] he will take care of it and then the biggest thing is Zeenat don't know,
[499.56] go and tell her, Go.
[507.65] [music] 
[514.13] [music]
[533.76] Now you are asking me to marry? Why what happened now?
[540.52] Mother, I am sick, why didn't you ask me when I was in good health,
[546.04] Now Vodka will take care of me through out my life.
[552.92] You will be fine,
[558.36] Mother, you used to say that courtesan can't become anyone's wife.
[564.16]  never marry. But she can
[569.83] Today I am regretting
[576.40] I wish I would be like Dil Ara. And make you dance only
[584.76] I wish these thoughts had occurred to me earlier
[591.22] Being born in a courtesan's house does
[598.04] not mean that you cannot take up any other profession,
[604.12] it is on a person's own will, washing someone's clothes, you can make a living
[613.04] even by washing utensils, isn't it? Mother
[618.80] if you realise your mistake in advance, than you never commit a mistake. 
[628.32] You are making a mistake again by marrying me to Vodka. This is not a mistake,
[636.24] You don't want to become a Bride?
[642.94] Mother, Which girl doesn't feel that
[647.60] she should get married and make her own home, that's why I say,
[654.08] you marry Vodka. He loves you very much. Greetings Auntie
[666.11] [Music]
[683.35] [Music]
[690.02] Zeenat
[704.97] [Music]
[710.32] You loves me very much? Yes
[719.36] Wants to marry me? Yes
[723.28] You know that I am sick
[731.88] You will recover, I will get you treated
[736.95] Treatment
[739.52] The doctor said that you will be completely fine,
[743.40] We will not stay here, will go away from here and will stay at some good place.
[750.88] I just want you to be happy, just dress up for me.
[758.24] I don't know for how long I have been dreaming of making you my bride,
[764.80] why didn't you do this before Vodka? I did
[772.40] but you didn't agree. How could I have agreed Vodka.
[779.40] Since childhood, the point was made clear that a courtesan never marries 
[790.00] and cannot raise children, she can only feed herself.
[796.84] The whole world works like this?
[800.84] a woman in the world does thousands of jobs, she can do many jobs. You can also do it,
[807.80]  
[813.72] Man, I always misunderstood Chanda but she is good.
[822.32] I am hating myself, I used to bring customers for you, you
[830.56] were so sick and I used to bring customers for you. 
[839.88] Sorry friend, I got emotional.
[846.60] Don't worry, everything will be fine,
[852.84] Tell me, you will become my bride?
[858.77] In your hands
[863.64] apply mehndi of my name? Yes
[870.61] [music]
