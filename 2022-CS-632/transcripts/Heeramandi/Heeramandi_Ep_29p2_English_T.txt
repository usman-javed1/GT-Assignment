[0.12] Now she will not come to this house Murad, no way. She will come, Shumail
[5.12] She will definitely come in this house
[10.64] because she is my wife 
[15.68] Because she was the mother of my future child
[19.88] Because she is a human being and not an animal that I kick her. She is worse than animals,
[26.64] she is a courtesan, people hates them more than animals, 
[38.12] I am hating you
[41.92] there is no humanity in you
[45.88] You don't even realize that she was dying because of you
[52.44] Shumail, neither does she want your money nor anything else, she is even
[58.56] ready to serve you. You think I need her services, I
[63.08] will keep a courtesan in my house and let her serve me? You really think so? 
[68.12] You wanted a child from her? You got me married to the same courtesan.
[74.72] She couldn't give you a child. Where is the child, she didn't give the child, now I 
[78.44] will throw her away in same trash from where I had picked her up. Even you
[83.52] couldn't give me a child, shall I throw you too in that trash?
[88.24] It was you who picked her up from that garbage, not me. Yes, I made a mistake,
[94.16] I agree. I have made a mistake, I want to correct that mistake, I
[98.88] want to end everything, the child is dead, divorce her, throw her out, otherwise I
[104.00] will not let her come into this house, I will push her out, I will kill her. 
[112.68] Come and take that courtesan
[117.60] You have crossed all the limits,
[122.76] Murad, you will divorce her otherwise you will divorce me!
[133.04] Let me tell you one thing Shumail, I cannot leave Zarka
[139.20] and now I will not leave her
[143.08] I never realized you could be such a mean, selfish, and helpless woman,
[151.52] perhaps Allah showed me all this so that your reality
[156.36] can be revealed before my eyes. What is her reality? A courtesan? Dancing and singing?
[162.36] She is bought and sold? Murad wives are not bought and sold. I don't
[168.24] know whether you are telling the truth or a lie because I have neither seen brothel nor have I
[173.08] ever seen her dancing. You told me that she is a courtesan, and you are the one who told me
[179.08] she is a non-selling courtesan, that's it,
[184.32] I don't want to argue any more,
[191.40] now you will not take decisions about my life, I will do myself.
[199.56] I am going to take Zarka. Listen to me, Murad, and listen carefully, if she comes to this
[207.44] house, I will kill her, or I will take my life and I am not joking.
[215.41] [Music]
[237.96] But Hema you were saying that Murad
[240.12] is taking her home from the hospital, then what happened? Chanda Khala, when I called to talk to Zarka
[247.56] her number was off and Murad Brother's phone was also not reachable
[252.44] and Shumail started shouting as soon as she picked up the phone. She was so rude, she said
[260.52] take this courtesan away from here, no matter what happens, now we will not
[267.40] leave Zarka there.
[271.44] Chanda, A calamity has befallen on my daughter again. She hasn't even gotten over the shock of the child.
[279.40] I don't understand, when Murad himself had said this, then ... Oh, you can't understand such small thing
[287.88] Murad is in love with Zarka, his wife is doing this all.
[292.12] Lafray, you take me to my daughter, I don't know in what condition
[298.52] she will be. Come on, don't be mad, relax, she
[303.32] is Murad's wife, he will take care of her and handle this all. Habib is right, look, this
[310.56] is a matter between the husband and wife, you should let Murad take care of it, don't interfere. Yes mother, we
[317.12] should not go, if she is upset, she would have called us herself.
[323.12] You just relax and wait. Everything will be fine Inshallah.
[340.76] I don't understand these rich people. 
[346.00] Yes brother, whom do I want to meet? I want to go inside
[348.00] to meet madam. You cannot go inside, stay here, I will ask madam.
[352.16] Hey ...
[357.20] At times, they tell me to go to the hospital, and at other times, they say come home
[362.76] Anyways, today Zarka will be mine.
[375.00] If they did not give my Zarka back, 
[379.96] I will kill them.
[391.64] How did you get inside? I came to take Zarka. If you want to take her, go to the hospital, take her
[398.12] and then get lost. Oh, madam, send Zarka out, or it won't end well
[404.80] She’s not at the hospital. Your husband brought her here, and I won’t go without taking her
[408.12] Are you in your senses? Get out of here, otherwise I will call the police. 
[412.12] This is beyond your father's jurisdiction. Give our girl back, or I’ll call the police
[415.88] and say that you have made her disappear. Stop this nonsense. Kick him out and if he doesn't go,
[420.40] tell me, I will call police. Get out! Hey, don't touch me.
[426.72] Tell your madam, I will not go without taking Zarka.
[432.60] I will set this house on fire. Are going or shall I hit you? Zarka is not here. Get lost.
[438.64] I will hit you. Open the door. Zarka!
[460.80] What is her reality? Courtesan? Dancing and singing? Brothel? She is bought and sold
[467.08] and Murad, wives are not bought or sold. I don't know whether you are telling the truth or
[473.76] a lie because I have neither seen brothel nor seen her dancing. You
[479.92] told me that she is a courtesan and it was you who told me that she is not to be sale
[484.84] courtesan, that's it, I don't want to argue any more about this
[492.02] Now you will not take the decisions of my life,
[498.60] I will do it myself,
[503.12] I am going to take Zarka. Listen to one thing, Murad, listen with open ears
[510.36] if If she comes to this house, I will kill her
[523.20] [Music] 
[547.52] Not for Zarka, I am worried about Guddu.
[549.00]  He had gone to take Zarka, then why he has not returned yet?
[558.72] Habib ....
[560.32] don't you think, Zarka will be with Guddu?
[565.52] No ... I don't think so.
[571.48] Where has this boy gone? I don't know where he has gone, I am tired
[576.36] of searching and calling, he is not picking up
[582.52] my heart is also very worried. Habib,
[587.28] please go and find him. Where shall I look for him?
[594.56] He will come back himself.
[601.88]  
[604.92] I can't end the sorrow of my Guddu, I am sad about this. Chande, he loves 
[613.16] Zarka a lot. Then why was he sold her? 
[618.40] She loved him so much, how much she cried for him. I
[625.52] had explained so much to him at that time he did not listen to me. Remember what he said about her?
[631.72] I do not love Zarka, I will not marry Zarka, what is she?
[637.24] No one knows when they can fall in love. It's not a color that can be seen nor fragrance that a human
[646.04] can feel. It just happens. For some it happens early, for some late.
[653.68] Guddu came to know late; he realized later that he loves Zarka.
[660.80] when she left, and many people do not even whole life
[668.00] realize that someone is in love with them
[674.40] It's late in the night, you go and try to search for him. It's not too late, it's
[682.64] dark, he must be roaming somewhere in darkness.
[688.24] Must be sitting and crying
[696.60]  
[702.04] It's good, no one can see your tears in dark
[709.61] Today, for the first time, I have realized
[718.24] that Guddu is very unluck. Oh, very unlucky
[727.68] Anyways, I am going to look for him.
[734.20] Thank God you are sitting peacefully, you have become habitual to being restless.
[741.56] Give me slippers
[744.84] I will go and ask Neighbours and call him. 
[753.80] You recite prayers and Quran.
[758.00] Pari, my heart is in peace now.
[765.52] It's night, Murad must have taken Zarka home and he must
[774.60] have taken care of everything
[777.36] that's why madam and Zarka's call has not come yet,
[783.64] I have only one wish in my heart, that my daughter settles down,
[789.72] Mother, but it would have been better if Zarka's child had also survived
[794.52] isn't it? God, who had given her this child,
[801.28] God will give her more children too. Now I just pray to God that
[808.64] our Zarka gets pregnant again, relation becomes stronger because of children. Mother, shall I call her?
[817.72] Don't call there. You called at that time, madam had picked up,
[824.52] maybe the phone is still with her and what
[830.48] is the need? My heart has got peace., So mother, now we will never be able to meet her?
[838.40] Why not? A child can never be separated from their mother. Have some patience. 
[849.72] Murad's house situation gets better, he will let her meet us. Go to sleep,
[854.28] I am not able to sleep, mother, I don't know, my heart is restless
[862.08] Who has come at this time? Go and check.
[867.64] It must be mischievous Whiskey. Don't let him enter the house,
[873.40] Zarka?
[876.56] Are you okay? Everything is fine? How you are here, at this time?
[884.48] why are you not saying anything? What has happened to you and why is your condition is like this?
[889.88] Zarka? You are here? You are empty handed? Mother,
[899.96] let her come inside, come in. Are you alright?
[909.16] Where is your husband? Pari, go and see that Murad will be standing outside. He must have bought her
[914.36]  Come with me.
[919.60]  
[924.16] My child, are you alright? 
[931.00] Oh Allah, my heart is scared, what happened, Murad did not take you home?
[939.48] oh, what has happened with you, tell me something?
[945.64]  Say something? Oh Allah!
[952.28] My child, what has happened with you, come here and sit down,
[960.44] sit here
[963.32] Hey, what has happened to you, tell me something?
[970.36] Please say something, what has happened to you, Shumail said something? 
[977.32] You had a fight with Murad? Hey, what has happened with you, tell me something!
[983.36] Mother, is Murad brother is not outside. This rickshaw driver is saying that Zarka has come with him
[990.24] Hey, Rickshaw driver, there seems to be some misunderstanding. My daughter's husband
[998.64] has a very big car, why would she come on your Rickshaw. I don't know this.
[1003.68] madam, I have brought her from the hospital. With much trouble, she explained the address to me
[1009.04] We have been roaming around the area for three hours. I will charge Rs.1000 for it.
[1014.64] Okay, you go, I am sending you the money.
[1020.56] Pari go and give him the money. What kind of trouble are you in?
[1028.28] Hey, what's the matter with you? Say something.
[1035.20] Murad said to you something. Did you have a fight with Shumail? Say something,
[1044.36] why you are not saying anything, what's wrong, what happened to you?
[1051.96] O Allah, what happened to my daughter?
[1057.68] Hey why are you silent Say something Say something
[1063.79]  
[1070.08] Oh Allah! What happened with my daughter?
[1079.65] [Music]
