Oh my, this motherfucker Mari Champa, where did she die? Hey Baba, why did you let her go? What did I know at the time of business? I had gone saying that I am going to the market to buy earrings, she has been buying earrings for three hours without any reason, what do I know? She had gone after saying for an hour that today I will get such news about that person that she will remember for the whole life. Heroine Sahiba has come and bought the earrings. Hey, where did Manu die? Oh, you motherfucker, shameless, where did that mother go? Hey, she is not going to tell me, motherfucker. With whom were you, tell me? With whom did Amma go to the market? With whom have I been going now? Why are you beating me? Didn't you die? It would have been better if you had died. If you disappear during business time, you fucking mother. If I had died, where would this money come from ? Well, who gave this money? She is saying again that she had not gone with anyone. She was an idiot. She saw my beautiful face and gave me the money. Ha ha ha, you are a very beautiful angel, didn't anyone see your face? And you have given the money, now go and get ready, I am going, I will come towards Husna now, lest she be full by the time I come, and listen, hurry up, don't delay, yes, I will tell you , my woe is this world that keeps complaining. It is very bad, death is better than such a life. What is the use of such a life in which there is neither mother nor father, all the relations are deceitful and liar, there is no one in this world like me, Amma said to me when I came a little late from the jar. I will never forgive those who have hurt my feelings, I will never forgive them. Hey, you had gone to meet that producer who had promised to make you a heroine. No, that producer is not here for a while, he lives in Lahore, then you. She has gone mad whenever she is speaking dialogues like film heroines. If Amma finds out, she will tear off your skin. This is a ghost that doesn't come down. Look at the weather, I wish it rains and this is not there, there is no one, this is this. This compulsion, this season and this distance, torment me for a moment, O your job worth two pillows and my monsoon worth lakhs, go away, this compulsion has become crazy, leave me, before you know it, get ready, Amma is about to come [praise] [music] [ Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [ Music] [ Music] [Music] [ Music] [Music ] [Music] [Music ] [Music] [Praise] [Music] [Praise] You pray that your father May we find Allah teri sun le [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Coffee What time is the flight at one o'clock Okay when will you come back when you call Listen [Music] I know you are angry and I I can't leave you angry, I know what my crime is, only that I had expressed my desire to give a name to an unnamed relationship and I did not express this out of jealousy or fear of people . It was an expression of my own emotions and no one realizes when any emotion comes into the heart. I am a person bereft of love. I am bereft of love. I cannot express myself. Now perhaps I am so close to love for the first time in my life. This happened once, there was no wall of love between you and me and there were no forests of distance, it was a nameless relationship which had to get a name if you wanted, otherwise this nameless relationship still exists which I am also feeling and you are also feeling [Music] [Music] [Music] Shara I should go with you where on the journey of life I meant not the airport , I will not be able to call you Avi [Music] Ho [Music] ] [Music] Oh oh man, give me the whiskey, man, all day long Champa and Hema keep hold of it, at night you take it with me and I will not let it go, you will spoil it from here, what will you do, will you make him a king, will you install DSP so that he Come and make our Chhol here, I will definitely make Chhatral also, in your insha'Allah, give it to me friend, unless you call it Guddu, I will never give it to you, you keep calling it Whiskey, it makes a lot of noise, I will never give it in its name, my son. A lot will happen when he grows up, you see, go away from here, I am putting him to sleep, my friend, ever since he was born, your eyes have changed, you have started behaving like a satellite with me, and what's more, I Whenever I ask for money, she says, now he has to be brought, now he has to be fed, now he has to be put to sleep, and if you ask, she gives it immediately, oh come on, my heart is beating, come here, my son, my child will become a government officer, he will learn English and will teach everyone about it. -He will talk big, he will do as ordered, ok my princess, now I will tell you the story, you just listen to the story and go to sleep, okay, our God is your king, God's minister, don't be careless, don't forget God, oh oh, I will tell you the story of the king, he will tell it in this way. Then what do you tell to the child Lohi reciting lohi here and there I tell you Aa oh give me yaar la fad dhade se aaj jaadi akhiyan mein nindiya jaade aaja dheere se aadi akhiyan mein nindiya aaj re aja dheere se aaj jaadi akhiyan mein [Music ] [Music] [Music] [Music] It does not happen that the fate of relationships gets broken due to change. Relationships created by man are not set in stone. Yes, but relationships created by God are set in stone. It was right that I used to say. And when was our relationship such that it could never change?
