Shehram, I am not able to understand If it was the same robbery as it happens nowadays, then why didn't he snatch any wallet, mobile, car or anything from you? Another thing is coming to my mind, maybe that boy Whiskey did this? No no, he don't have this much courage. You hit him, it is possible that he did this in anger. He could only make noise, I don't know. Asalam alikum ...Walikum asalam. How are you?  Much better but I am sorry, I can't get up. It's okay, you lie down. Did you found out who stabbed? No I think someone wanted to rob me. He saw someone coming and ran away from there. I still don't understand why he stabbed when you didn't protest on anything. Same thing we are also not able to understand that Shehram has no enmity with anyone. I will bring tea for both of you [Music] Now you have done the right thing, absolutely right, now just pray to Allah that the sooner the matter is resolved, the better it is, But I am still hanging. I told you it would be difficult Shumail. Okay, tell me, there was any meeting between the two? Nothing special, a little conversation, just nothing special, I think, Murad. Despite wanting, is not able to do it, as something stops him. You Shumail You are stopping him. Your presence stops him. What should I do? Don't go home today, stay here with me. Send Murad alone to Zarka. [Music]  I feel that I will never know who he was for the rest of my life. So why don't you file an FIR? In whose name shall I file? Leave this. As you wish! Shall we leave? I am staying here tonight. Yes Murad, let her stay here today. You can pick her in the morning. As you both wish. Anyway, take care of yourself and if possible don't go to the office. Come on, it will be fine in a day or two. It will not be fine in a day or two if you don't take care and please don't let him go to the office.  I will not let him go. Great, I am leaving now. Khuda Hafiz. Murad, Zarka, is alone at home and she is your wife. Please you know what I am trying to say. [Music]  Who is there? Murad! Thank you.   Where is shumail sister ? She will stay there today How is uncle's health? He is better.   You had dinner? No, I was waiting for you guys I will change and then we will have dinner together.  Wound is deep? Uncle ... No, he is out of danger now, I mean he is is fine, but he got 12 stitches Did he found out who had done this? No ... nothing has been found yet and there is no robbery either. Will you drink coffee? It would be great, if I get after dinner. You will drink coffee? If you will drink, then I will also drink. I will make it. Yes [Music]  [Music] Wait, I will make it, that day you had burnt your hand [Music]    Now that hand of yours is fine, the one that was burnt? It's better now.   I wanted to talk to you about something important. Tell me, what you want to say? Well, I was thinking that you never, I mean you had never asked for anything. I don't really know what you want, you can ask, you can say whatever you want. You can say to Shumail, I don't want anything You were trying to say something I was saying that what is the use of me staying here silently like this then you leave me [Music] [Music]  [Music] Murad, where are you? I have been waiting for you for a long time. I thought that you will come Okay, then come quickly. I am waiting Okay! Uncle has woken up? He slept after taking the sleeping pill, I did not wake him up. It's good, let him rest. I had received a call from Murad, he is coming. Shumail do not fight with him. I know Thanks. [Music] You are not happy? I am happy You are quite so I thought I was thinking Shumail sister will be more happy about this. She want this all as soon as possible What happened between you, Shumail and antie ... I was not part of it I know,  Zarka, I feel as I have done a big loss with my hands, Don't say anything. It's a deal. And there is always profit and loss in the deal. I pray you get profit, I don't know but I am feeling bad about you. very insulting for you You don't have CD? Actually yesterday the car had gone for service. All the stuff is lying in the garage. Are you fond of listening to songs? Yes You do not wear anything in your hands, I mean, no bangles etc. Glass bangles, I like their tinkling sound. I just like their sound when it breaks, it injure  wrist My wrist got cut many times from it. It's been so long, I don't know where Murad is? He will come, at this time the traffic is also heavy, Hello I am coming Murad. Call him inside. He has to drop me then he will have to go to the office, it will be too late, we will come tomorrow.
