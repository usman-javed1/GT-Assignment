[12.66] [Music] 
[46.40] Shumail ....Please ...
[53.16] Please listen to me I am really sorry I should not have gone to the kitchen 
[59.16] Did I asked you?
[62.20] I want to tell you something. But I don’t want to hear anything.
[68.18] But I am very hurt. I had even sent you to her myself.
[73.58] but you men have a habit of sneaking
[77.28] Listen, Shumail. If you listen to me just once... No, I don't want to hear anything. Nothing at all.
[85.09] Shumail please .... No .... No ....
[93.20] What's the trouble, man?
[97.43] What was the need to go into the kitchen?
[104.40] Yes, tell me.
[109.50] No, no, everything is fine. I'll tell you when I come down.
[115.94] Bye!
[119.10] Neelam, I wanted to talk to you for a long time,
[127.52] but I thought you might feel bad. Chanda, I have heard so many things in my life.
[133.56] Now I can't tell which thing I liked and which I didn't. You tell me what you were saying?
[142.18] I was thinking, get Guddu married.
[148.62] If you agree, make Rani my daughter in Law
[155.56] Look, I know Rani is much better then Guddu.
[161.24] But you also understands that a good woman can reform a wayward man.
[168.66] Guddu is very bad but ....
[172.40] He's not as bad as you think.
[175.56] And anyway, why would I take offense at what you said?
[180.60] That's something to be happy about. After all, Rani had to get married someday, right?
[187.42] Honestly, I was very worried. If something happens to me tomorrow, what will happen to Rani?
[194.68] And the stain that's on us won't go away.
[199.72] But not everyone's fate is as bright as Zarka's.
[203.16] At least it's a happy thing that Rani will also get married. Thank God, that you’re thinking like this too.
[210.00] I was really scared that you might take it the wrong way.
[214.42] But listen, make sure to ask Rani.
[218.56] Her consent should be included. Yes, I’ll ask. I don’t think Rani will have any objection.
[224.62] They have a strong friendship. They go out together.
[228.44] Hey Rani, enjoy peanuts!
[232.55] Hey, why would you remember that?
[234.24] Everyone must be serving you roasted peanuts but today try the cold ones! Whiskey bought for you.
[241.46] Whiskey! You really care about me.
[244.87] Hey, apart from you, who else would I take care of?
[247.49] You're the only one here who understands me. In fact, you are my queen.
[256.17] What are you doing? You've started drinking again. What's the point?
[260.96] I used to drink sometimes before, and I still do occasionally. I had told you not to drink.
[265.60] Hey, you didn’t really mean it from the heart, that's why it hasn’t had any effect, see?
[268.28] Okay. Hey, what are you doing?
[272.51] Hey, why did you break the bottle? I just had one sip! Okay
[278.76] Put your hand on my head and swear that you won’t drink alcohol again.
[282.00] Hey, let go of my hand.
[285.14] No, I won't let go of your hand. Swear on my head.
[289.71] Okay, I'm saying I won't drink. But I won't swear. If something happens to you...
[294.55] But what was the need to throw it away? I had just taken a sip.
[298.87] Oh no, You are so upset about the bottle. I bought it with my own money.
[304.95] You don’t care about me at all.
[309.21] Okay, forget it. Just give me peanuts. Take ... Peel them ... Shall I put in your mouth too? I'll eat them myself; just peel them
[320.49] [Music]
[328.64] [Music]
[335.83] Hey, maybe there's a little left.
[342.93] [Music]
[395.48] You've been sitting here for the last two hours.
[399.66] It's dew outside. Why do you want to get sick? Come on, let's go inside.
[408.28] Nothing will happen by sitting here. Come on. I know nothing will happen even if we go inside.
[416.25] Please leave me alone. Just let me be.
[423.96] I said, leave me alone, just leave me alone
[440.79] [Music]
[459.70] Son, I am not forcing anything on you. If you want, you can deny it.
[467.52] Think about this: there’s no one else in this world for you and me. We don’t have a home.
[475.00] No man other than whiskey with whom I can live peacefully after marrying you
[482.20] and the torture that you and I have faced. Yes, you must not have forgotten it,
[488.89] No mom, how can I forget all that,
[494.46] Anyway, we have not found better people than Whiskey and Chanda in the whole world
[502.49] Chanda, said to me to ask you if you like Whiskey or not?
[511.61] Mom you are absolutely right, and apart from these people, who else do we have?
[519.49] If you want this, then it's fine.
[525.04] May you live long, my daughter. I only have one fear, my child.
[531.07] If my eyes close tomorrow, what will happen to you? Mom, why are you talking like this? Nothing will happen to you.
[538.32] Shall say yes to them? Yes!
[542.82] Evil eyes off!
[549.48] She is not your wife, and if she is, she won't be anymore. Divorce her right now.
[553.16] Speak softly; your voice is going outside. I don't care, let the whole world hear.
[558.43] I didn't bring her to this house so that she would wander around in my house 
[562.98] You keep following her around the house. You have hurt me.
[567.72] You’ve deceived me. I had even sent you to her myself.
[571.86] Then what was the need to meet in secret? What are you saying?
[575.27] When have I met her in secret? Now be quiet, okay?
[578.37] I won’t tolerate her in this house for a second, understand? Divorce her now.
[585.85] You want me to divorce her, right? I will, but let me talk to Aunty.
[591.22] because it was her responsibility. She is noone's responsibility.
[594.44] I brought her into this house, and I will be the one to kick her out from here.
[608.03] What happened to him?
[618.57] Why is Murad's phone off?
[639.43] [Music]
[648.52] [Music]
[672.26] Murad, listen to me clearly one thing,
[674.72] if this woman stays in this house, I will die by consuming poison, Oh, I don’t want children.
[679.56] I made a mistake, please forgive me. Speak softly. I won’t say it softly. Please, for God's sake.
[685.68] I will tell the whole world. I will scream and tell everyone that, I made a mistake.
[690.82] Divorce her now. Why are you making a spectacle of this?
[697.04] You are making my life hell. I’m suffering because of you. So put an end to this 
[702.15] torture, give her a divorce, otherwise I will leave this house,
[705.68] I will give up my life. Stop this nonsense, now end this all.
[709.48] Whatever you want, however you want, I will do in the morning. Not in the morning,
[714.92] not in the morning, right now, you will divorce her, otherwise I will push her and
[719.72] take her out on the streets, now. Shumail, listen to me, Shumail, don't do this like this
