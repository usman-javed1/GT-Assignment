Mom, it means Zarka will never be able to come here. Hey, I pray that she doesn't come here.  What are you saying? Why wouldn’t she come here? You don't know Pari, I am a mother I wasn't even a courtesan. I came from a good family. I had already spoiled my own soil it would have been better if I had married and given birth to you how nice it would have been. now Allah has found a way, my daughter is married I pray that she never comes back, I think for you too, May I find a good place for you to get married. May Allah grant you good fortune. Let it be, Mom. You didn’t marry her;  you have sold her  Those who are keeping her confined today will be the same ones after the child is born will send her back home. Oh, don’t say such things. Don’t do that. May her child does not born too soon. Oh Allah, perform such a miracle that my daughter does not come here. Alright, now you go, all the household work is pending. Go and make tea for me. I have a headache so I can take some medicine. I am feeling hungry. Let me eat first. You didn’t let me eat there. Take tea later. Alright, let’s just eat. But you listen to me. Don’t worry about her not coming over here. They are decent people. That boy has gotten married. Does anyone send their wife to a brothel? Just don't give me a headache by talking like this anymore. If we want, we can go meet her. Have they stopped us? What good people they are. Alright, go and bring the food. [Song] leave this,Today, I’ve brought good food from a big hotel. Move this food. I will not eat a bite with your earnings. This is disgraceful earnings. And what you have been eating your entire life. By bringing customers and taking commissions. That was not unlawful earnings? That was not disgraceful earnings? Look, I’m telling you old man. Don’t be clever with me. You all are ungrateful. I got her married, didn't book her for one night. Hey, have some shame. Be ashamed. If you had married Zarka, she would have been serving your mother. Oh, you are enough to serve her. Whenever she cries, just keep wiping her tears. I feel a lot of regret, Guddu. You should have died at birth. It would have been better if I had died at your birth. It would have been better if I had died at birth. If I hadn’t been born, who would have deposited 3 lakh in Mom's account? Have you ever seen 3 lakh in your life? Guddu, just get up and go away. I don’t want to eat your food. Go to hell, Guddu. Alright, alright, I'm leaving. If you don’t want to eat, then don’t. Why are you throwing a tantrum? At least think about your age. Hey, what a lentil you have cooked, you could have learned something from Zarka Stop eating lentils and rice. Here, I’ve brought chicken for you all, from a big hotel. You probably have never tasted such food in your life. I guarantee it. We don’t want to eat, take it back. And tell me, what deal you made about Zarka? that she will never come here? What does that mean? Oh, didn’t Zarka come? Auntie, you went to bring her. Pari, I had told you not to fuss or make a scene. Tell the whole story; why didn’t they send her? That's why you made a deal. Oh come on, I didn’t make any such deal.  How we can break relationship with her? Whiskey, listen to me and let her blabber. They are absolutely right.  The deal was that they would take her after marriage and send her back after having child? Does any decent man send his wife to a brothel? Auntie I won’t allow any such thing to happen. We didn't give her away forever. And neither we will break our relationship with her. Even their father will send her. I will go bring her back. Let’s see who stops me. Hey, listen to me. You are not going there, understand? I’ve fallen into such a difficult situation. Everyone's mind is messed up. They didn’t let Zarka come. I was just about to go there, but Auntie stopped me. No, Whiskey. Just see, they won’t send Zarka. And you don’t need to go there either. Why no need? She didn't went there forever. Alright, forget it. I don’t understand. What will you and Auntie earn, and what will you eat? The brothel has been abandoned. Now it’s just you and Pari left. Why don’t you start dancing and singing? I can do it. And you know, I’ve learned to dance too. Now that’s the spirit! And see, there’s nothing wrong with it. Think, Neither Lafrah have any work nor do I have any.  I still drive a rickshaw, but poor Lafrah. And, I did get Zarka's money in my share, didn’t I? Poor Lafda is sitting at his betel shop, but there’s no one to buy from him. You know, Whisky, Mom had saved some money. Now that’s about to run out too. But who will explain this to Mom? My mom is no less than your mom. I will say to Lafrah. He will convince to both of them. Alright, Whisky. Tell me one thing. Speak honestly. What? Zarka used to say,  You loved her and wanted to marry her too. So then what happened? Oh, it’s not like that. I neither loved her nor wanted to marry her. I hate the name of marriage. People deceive with the name of marriage. My father did the same thing. I swear, the day I meet that guy, I will hit him. I feel like God created me to take revenge for my mother. I will kill him the day I find him. Okay, kill him when you find him. Don't get angry now. I'm feeling hungry again, please feed me something. I'm tired of feeding you since morning, how much do you eat?  What I want to talk to you about now... Promise me. You won’t tell anyone. Chanda, you don't trust me? Tell me, what's the matter? I went to Zarka's in-laws' place. I saw Guddu's father. What? Which one was he? Why didn’t you tell me? How should I tell? That's why I left from there. I've been worried since then. Why was he at Zarka's in-laws' place? That's why I didn't go to Zarka with Hema. So you should have asked Zarka. I just told you I don’t want anyone to find out. How can I ask Zarka? And even if I ask, what am I supposed to do? I'm already hurt anyway. Chanda, it would have been better if you had met him. He might still remember you even today. If he remembered me, he wouldn't have come here? He must have seen me too. He must have figured it out. That I am someone related to Zarka. He might have even asked Zarka about you? No, if he had asked, Zarka would have told me. Anyway, who remembers a prostitute? He came here at the insistence of friends. He must have left because of his family's threats You are right. But you could have told him; he has a son with you. What should I tell him? That his child is a broker?     Who brings customers for the prostitutes? He smokes weed and is lost in a life of aimlessness. He even sold his fiancee. What should I tell him? Won't it hurt him to hear all this? I don't know whether he will accept Guddu or not. He is a respectable man, he have respectable children  They must be studying in good colleges. If he accept's Guddu then Will he take him to his home? Chanda, why didn't you tried to send Guddu to him when he was young? I tried very hard. I searched for him a lot. But Guddu and I have really bad luck He never showed up. I never found him. Listen, Neelam. Talking to you has lightened my heart. If you ever meet Zarka, even by mistake, don’t let this conversation slip out. What are you saying? Don't worry; it will never happen. You don’t need to stress. Alright, Don't think too much. Alright, you should sleep. Rani is also alone in the room. I'll go check on her. Alright, don’t think too much. Just sleep.   [TV Sound] [Music] You are drinking tea on an empty stomach, it is not good for health. It is my habit since childhood. I'll make breakfast for you. No, no need. I woke up early because I had to go to the office. Come, sit down.  Shumail sister, Shall I make breakfast for you? No, I don’t want to have breakfast. Shumail, listen. Shumail, Shumail, listen to me. Shumail What happened to you?  Is something wrong with me, or is something wrong with you? Why are you behaving this way with me? Should I regret what I've done, Murad? Tell me. I did all this because we both needed a child.So what am I doing? You are doing what’s in your heart. You are doing something, Murad, that I never expected. After all, you are a man. Otherwise, why do you sneak into her room at night? Stop talking nonsense. That's why I said no to you. It's my mistake Now I'm regretting it. I told you that you would regret it, but you didn’t listen to me. And even now, I'm not doing anything. Neither I bring that woman into this house, you bring her. I don't want a child. I don’t want a child. I really don’t want
