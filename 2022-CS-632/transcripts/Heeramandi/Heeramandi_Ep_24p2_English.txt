[Music]  Shumail ....Please ... Please listen to me I am really sorry I should not have gone to the kitchen  Did I asked you? I want to tell you something. But I don’t want to hear anything. But I am very hurt. I had even sent you to her myself. but you men have a habit of sneaking Listen, Shumail. If you listen to me just once... No, I don't want to hear anything. Nothing at all. Shumail please .... No .... No .... What's the trouble, man? What was the need to go into the kitchen? Yes, tell me. No, no, everything is fine. I'll tell you when I come down. Bye! Neelam, I wanted to talk to you for a long time, but I thought you might feel bad. Chanda, I have heard so many things in my life. Now I can't tell which thing I liked and which I didn't. You tell me what you were saying? I was thinking, get Guddu married. If you agree, make Rani my daughter in Law Look, I know Rani is much better then Guddu. But you also understands that a good woman can reform a wayward man. Guddu is very bad but .... He's not as bad as you think. And anyway, why would I take offense at what you said? That's something to be happy about. After all, Rani had to get married someday, right? Honestly, I was very worried. If something happens to me tomorrow, what will happen to Rani? And the stain that's on us won't go away. But not everyone's fate is as bright as Zarka's. At least it's a happy thing that Rani will also get married. Thank God, that you’re thinking like this too. I was really scared that you might take it the wrong way. But listen, make sure to ask Rani. Her consent should be included. Yes, I’ll ask. I don’t think Rani will have any objection. They have a strong friendship. They go out together. Hey Rani, enjoy peanuts! Hey, why would you remember that? Everyone must be serving you roasted peanuts but today try the cold ones! Whiskey bought for you. Whiskey! You really care about me. Hey, apart from you, who else would I take care of? You're the only one here who understands me. In fact, you are my queen. What are you doing? You've started drinking again. What's the point? I used to drink sometimes before, and I still do occasionally. I had told you not to drink. Hey, you didn’t really mean it from the heart, that's why it hasn’t had any effect, see? Okay. Hey, what are you doing? Hey, why did you break the bottle? I just had one sip! Okay Put your hand on my head and swear that you won’t drink alcohol again. Hey, let go of my hand. No, I won't let go of your hand. Swear on my head. Okay, I'm saying I won't drink. But I won't swear. If something happens to you... But what was the need to throw it away? I had just taken a sip. Oh no, You are so upset about the bottle. I bought it with my own money. You don’t care about me at all. Okay, forget it. Just give me peanuts. Take ... Peel them ... Shall I put in your mouth too? I'll eat them myself; just peel them [Music] [Music] Hey, maybe there's a little left. [Music] You've been sitting here for the last two hours. It's dew outside. Why do you want to get sick? Come on, let's go inside. Nothing will happen by sitting here. Come on. I know nothing will happen even if we go inside. Please leave me alone. Just let me be. I said, leave me alone, just leave me alone [Music] Son, I am not forcing anything on you. If you want, you can deny it. Think about this: there’s no one else in this world for you and me. We don’t have a home. No man other than whiskey with whom I can live peacefully after marrying you and the torture that you and I have faced. Yes, you must not have forgotten it, No mom, how can I forget all that, Anyway, we have not found better people than Whiskey and Chanda in the whole world Chanda, said to me to ask you if you like Whiskey or not? Mom you are absolutely right, and apart from these people, who else do we have? If you want this, then it's fine. May you live long, my daughter. I only have one fear, my child. If my eyes close tomorrow, what will happen to you? Mom, why are you talking like this? Nothing will happen to you. Shall say yes to them? Yes! Evil eyes off! She is not your wife, and if she is, she won't be anymore. Divorce her right now. Speak softly; your voice is going outside. I don't care, let the whole world hear. I didn't bring her to this house so that she would wander around in my house  You keep following her around the house. You have hurt me. You’ve deceived me. I had even sent you to her myself. Then what was the need to meet in secret? What are you saying? When have I met her in secret? Now be quiet, okay? I won’t tolerate her in this house for a second, understand? Divorce her now. You want me to divorce her, right? I will, but let me talk to Aunty. because it was her responsibility. She is noone's responsibility.
