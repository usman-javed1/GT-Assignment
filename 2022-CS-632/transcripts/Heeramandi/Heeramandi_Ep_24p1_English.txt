Hey, I have done the right thing, Mother, never see my face neither kissed me! That she is sad for me now. Talk slow. Someone will hear you. If they find out what you did, Hema auntie and Pari will definitely be angry. They will break your hands and legs. Hey, breaking hands and feet isn’t that easy! And even if they find out, what will happen then? Look, this is my personal matter. That guy slapped me. I didn’t wear the bangles; that I won’t take revenge from him. Tell me one thing: you arranged Zarka's marriage yourself, right? So why are you doing all this? That’s why they weren’t letting me meet her. So what wrong did they do? You were the one who married Zarka off to them. They bought Zarka. Once you sell something, you don't have any rights over it. Oh Come on. We didn't sell her forever. Whatever time period it is, you have no rights over her now. Accept this fact now. Besides, if you cared so much for her .... I made a mistake It was a mistake. I didn’t realize it then, but now I do. When she was sitting as a bride with Murad, right? It came to my heart that I should end this deal. That's why they say, that a person should think carefully before taking any step. Otherwise, time passes, and a person keeps regretting. I am going   It has become so messed up. I told you before. You didn’t listen. Alright, listen. Habib, I'm really worried.Why don't you do it like this that You go to their house and somehow convince them. Make sure they don’t file a report. If they file a report, he will get caught. And you know how much the police beat people up. Fall at their feet or do whatever it takes to convince them. Or I can also come with you. I’ll fall in their feet and convince them. You’ve gone mad, Chanda. Sit down and relax; we’re not going anywhere. But Habib .... If they filed a case... They would have arrested Guddu by now. Got it? And first of all, Zarka should have found out. She would have told Hema. Hema would have broken his legs. You're right. But you can at least do this, that you go to Zarka's house for some reason and find out what the situation is there. Hey, I don't want to know anything. I'm not going there. Didn’t you see how much Hema scolded Guddu? There was such a commotion last time. And then Zarka said no to both Hema and Pari. Chanda ... Chanda.  Hema is here, so don’t talk in front of her. I know. Hey, Chanda. You look so happy! Yes, I’m really happy.  Is everything alright with Zarka? Everything is fine now, and Zarka is very happy. Mashallah! Sit down. Lafray, Hey Lafray. Oh, there never seems to be any happiness in your life. At least bring some sweets. If you can’t bring sweets, then at least bring sweet pan! You're absolutely right. There is nothing in my life. Oh, that’s why I gave up all bad things in life. By the way, you did a really good thing by giving up alcohol. But I miss it a lot. Oh no! Who are you talking about? You're bringing up something that makes the heart ache.  Alright, go and bring some sweetness, please! Let me fix the machine, then I’ll go. Okay, forget it! So tell me, how is Zarka doing? She's doing very well. So well that I'll sleep soundly tonight! Oh, where are Neelum and Rani? Have they gone out somewhere? Chanda, now my only prayer to Allah is to find a good boy for Pari and get her married too. Then we will look at Lafrah, we will think something about Lafrah also. Hey, Hema, consider your age! Making jokes isn't good at this age. Got it? You are not going to the office? No, there was no such work in the office today so I thought that it will be done  Hello! Who? Walikum Salaam. Well yes Zarka, call for you. For me? Yes, why don’t you keep your phone with you? I forget Shoukd I keep the phone with me in the kitchen also? Okay, give me now. Hello, Pari! How are you? I’m doing well. I’m very happy! How about you and mother? [Music]  [Music] [Music] [Music]  [Music] [Music] [Music] Whisky Listen, see, you said that you brought it for me, so why are you hiding it?  I want to see this, give me Whisky .... Listen,  I can't give you like this!  Alright, fine. I don't need it now. How can you say you don’t want it? I brought it especially for you! Okay, fine. Give it to someone else; I don’t want it. Hey, listen don’t be upset with me. Here, take it. I brought it with great care. Such a small gift? You brought this with great care? Open it and see; it's very precious. I really brought it with my life in my hands! You brought it with your life in hands! I should also see what kind of precious gift you've brought. Whisky. Hold it once. I will kill you Whisky! I will give you a good one too, first you hold it. I will kill you. Look, it can run also. Whisky, I will not spare you! I’ve given such a nice gift; what more do you want? Oh no mosquito! Hey, silly, where are you wandering off to? Come on! Go inside and sleep. I’m not coming. I’ll come later. Hey, don’t go crazy! Get up and let’s go. I’m telling you to get up! You’ve gone mad! You’ll get sick. Come on, get up! Okay leave my hand. I’m coming. Your antics never seem to end! Always being so dramatic!  If I die, you will also die. Take care of your health, okay? Always lying around here! I’m tired of running after you.  Good evening! The weather is quite strange. It’s cold in the morning when you step out. In the afternoon, it gets hot. I swear I’ll get really sick! What happened to you, Shumail? Something should happen to me? No, I mean. Murad, I have made hot tea for you. Thank you! I've also made kebabs; you like them, right? Yes, you make shami kebabs very deliciously. Give me some! Here you go, enjoy! These are really delicious! They deserve an award. Seriously? For you! I brought for you too! I hope you like it. These are gold. I asked Zarka why you don't wear bangles? She said, glass bangles are sharp and give cuts! That's why I've brought same for both of you! You like them? They're very beautiful. Now please make some tea. Sure! Hey, Chanda, you’re again crying? And over there, Whiskey too. I felt really sorry for the poor guy. He came to meet you upstairs last night. And for a long time, he was watching you sleep outside your door. Don't you feel sorry for him? Please forgive him. A mother's heart isn't that hard. What can I do, Neelam? I'm his mother, but I'm embarrassed by his actions. Always misbehaving, always being naughty. What can I do instead of crying quietly? But Chanda Auntie, you always forgive him. Please forgive him again. It's been so many days with this anger. He can't even enjoy himself without you.  Chanda Auntie, just call him upstairs. No, Rani, If I forgive him this time as well Then he won't realize how much his actions hurt me. Just stop. The child has realized, so how much more punishment will you give him? I am getting punished for giving birth to him and raising him. Isn’t it my responsibility? I have to bear the consequences. Don't think like that. Everything will be fine. He loves you a lot. Forgive him. Embrace him; he’s your son. Hey, where have you been? Are you in Islamabad or  have you moved to America? What’s going on? You just vanished. It's been so long since we talked! Yes, oh no! A person shouldn't be so unfaithful; they should care about their friends. Murad says that your best friend didn’t even give her number and just disappeared. Murad is fine. He came from the office and  then went somewhere. Now he've just stepped in. He just came home. I’ll give your regards and greetings, whatever you say! yes, okay.. Yes, we're waiting for that happy news! You know the situation well. So, how are the kids? Did you talk to them? That's very good! Now that you're here, we'll keep talking. Right? Okay, Salma, I’ll talk to you later. Okay, I’ll call you back. Allah Hafiz! You really enjoy making shami kebabs! Taste them! It's hot! It was too hot, Shall I give you water? No, no, it’s okay. I burnt my tongue. What Happened?
