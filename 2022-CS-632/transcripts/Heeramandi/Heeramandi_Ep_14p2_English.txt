I like that you are worried for me, but the way to get me out of trouble is not that you start thinking about marriage This is not your problem, but solution of my problem Are you mad? Neither am I mad, nor I am child, I can understand my good and bad. I know what will be the outcome of the decision. Now please don't say this because you are older than me, hence this marriage cannot happen. It's fine. I have not made any big promises of love to you, but I know this who is important for me and who is not You are very sensible Shehram, you understand things, that is why I expect you do not take any decision without thinking. Look, if you live in this world, you have to listen to the people of this world.  Then why are you afraid? I am not afraid of anyone, that's why I don't want to marry anyone out of fear. I know Shehram that I can't marry you. I respect your feelings. I admit that you have been useful to me in all my good and bad times, I also admit that I have got used to of you, maybe you too. But not marriage Look, if you say, I will not leave from here, I will stay here, and face everyone. Okay, when they see that there is nothing like this between us, then they will become quite them self. But you will not marry? No! Why? Am I this bad? Can't I support you? Can't I give you the happiness that is your right? Look at me, now tell me what is lacking in me? There is nothing lacking in you, you are very good, that is why I want you to marry a good girl.  Good girl? A good girl, is the one whose age is less than me. Whether she know me or not, our life after marriage is good or bad? You are very emotional, how can I explain to you this. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]     [Music] Why are you crying? Why are you crying?  Tell me, aren't you happy? These are tears of happiness, tell me why are you crying  Vodka,  I'm crying because why mother didn't get us married earlier   We are so unlucky, we make other's happy and kill our own happiness. I'm crying just because why didn't I listen to you earlier So what happened? Now you have accepted what's wrong now? What's the use now? Don't talk stupid. Do you know how happy I am today, don't see the benefit in everything, today you are my wife  Today I am very happy. The dream that I had seen years before has come true today, You have applied mehndi of my name on your hand, today you dressed up for me.
