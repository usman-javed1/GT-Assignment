[9.84] Zarka, we have come to take you. Why have you all come here?
[15.16] I don't want to go anywhere. It's okay, she didn't want to go, you do this, give birth then come back.
[22.76] Keep quiet Lafray, No Zarka, I came to take you, you called at night, right? Yes, I
[28.92] did. Then why did you say that he has divorced you?
[35.08] My heart was worried, that is why I said it, but neither has he divorced me,
[41.48] nor do I have to go anywhere.Lafray, there is something wrong, I will not go like this.
[50.60] You heard what she said. Zarka, you go inside.
[58.08] Zarka ....
[62.36] Now you have heard everything, so go now. I will not go from here like this, sir. Hey, you
[67.96] will not keep quiet? Clear the amount and send the girl with us. What am I saying, let's go back!
[71.92] Leave me, Lafary. Hey, you are not doing well, I had seen Zarka's face, they have forcefully stopped her
[77.44] don't know what they did with her. Go away from here decently, otherwise I
[83.08] know other ways also. Sir, there is no need to threaten, we too are not wearing bangles, explain
[87.40] Explain him, it only takes two minutes. You get lost from here. I will not go,
[92.20] I will not go, leave me. For God's sake, for
[96.92] the sake of Chanda. Don't swear to my mother, I am going.
[102.20] Listen, I am waiting for you bring Zarka with you. Go from here.
[114.04] Sir, he is short tempered. I say sorry on his behalf. It's okay.
[119.96] You don't worry, Madam Zarka is your's. You just take care of her,
[127.04] Obviously, we have to take care of her and you also don't worry at all. Sir, I
[135.28] don't his words. Come I will drop you till gate. 
[141.20] Sir, that Sheram Sir who met me, how do you know him? He is my wife's relative
[150.96] the aunt who got this marriage, He is her husband. Okay Why are you asking?
[157.68] Nothing sir, I met him a long time ago, I recognize him, he don't recognize me.
[171.51] Take care! I will manage, you don't worry.
[176.98] Zarka, did not come along with you? I
[182.24] brought you along so we can take Zarka back. You came here to fight, you bastard, I will leave you here,
[186.76] come back yourself. Don't talk non sense,  listen to me. Hey Guddu ...
[191.84] How you can leave me here, hey my child, I know, listen to me, see this
[197.44] Hey Guddu ....
[238.72] Asalam aleikum Sheram Brother, It's good that I found you here
[246.36] actually, Chanda had given a message for you ... Money ...
[252.76] You know that we have made a good deal with you, we have not cheated you at all,
[257.80] Don't talk non sense, I had given her money, she refused
[264.60] because she ... She refused because she wants, 20 instead of 10. 
[271.48] This was the reason, by the way, you never turned back. Lafra, tell me that Chanda
[277.04] is really waiting for Sheram, I mean last night she was waiting for Sheram
[282.64] or for someone else? She was waiting for him. She was definitely waiting. I mean,
[289.32] he had to give the money, but then another customer arrived, our work was done.
[294.84] He paid double amount. He was an honest man. We had golden jubilee.
[306.20] [Music]
[317.76] What is wrong, even whiskey is not picking up the phone, and Lafhrah has no phone,
[323.88] Hey Chanda, my heart is sinking. You come with me. Okay,
[328.56] I will go with you, Hey Pari, please call Zarka again. I am calling her.
[339.20] Hello Zarka, are you okay? Why were you not picking up the phone? Give it to me, 
[347.84] Zarka, it has been the whole night that we stayed awake. Please tell me what happened?
[354.04] Lafra and Whiskey did not reach there, you are coming with them? No,
[361.60] mother, I am not coming. Yes, Lafrah and Whiskey have left,
[370.12] Mother, nothing happened.
[374.16] I heard Shumail saying to Murad that he  divorce me, I got scared
[383.20] and called, but Murad did not divorce me,
[387.80] Mother, yesterday
[392.32] I became unwell, Murad took me to the hospital,
[398.20] do you know what happened there? Tell me quickly what happened? Tell me the truth. 
[406.20] My heart is sinking. I feel that you are lying, I am just coming to take you.
[410.72] Now I can't even go and you know mother, Murad has said that he
[419.24] will never divorce me, do you know why? Because I am,
[425.96] going to become a mother. Hey, what are you saying? Thank God!
[434.64] We were worried all night, you talk to Chanda. What happened?
[442.08] Hello ... Zarka
[447.72] Really? Allah bless you, congratulations! Mashallah!
[456.72] now you just take good care of yourself and switch off the phone,
[462.96] let me congratulate your mother, she was crying because of your problem, now she
[466.88]  crying after hearing your good news, Okay dear God bless you! Hope
[473.00] everything is good, what are you congratulating for? Hey, I have talked to Zarka, she
[478.20] is going to be a mother. Ah, congratulations, thanks to God.
[486.64] You were getting worried for no reason.
[490.48] You have made everyone, yourself, Murad and Zarka sad!
[497.28] I had said sorry to Murad. You said sorry to Murad, and you have
[503.64] spoiled Zarka's and your relations? Just imagine if she refuses to give her child to you?
[509.48] How can she do this? She can do everything to do so. It
[516.28] was a matter of understanding. If you end that understanding by fighting,
[520.20] then you can not take her child by force. That child is ours, how can
[526.08] we let her take? Give up your stubbornness and have good terms with her, if she leaves,
[533.12] you will not get the child, there is only one way to stop her,
[537.60] say sorry to her. 
[541.52] Keep good terms with her.
[547.88] Zarka, I am sorry. I just got angry. Sister, why are you talking like this and
[557.56] anyway, it was my fault. It was not your fault, nor
[563.60] did Murad anything wrong. Shumail should not have done this, but you did not talk
[571.48] to anyone in your house about this? I had called mother
[577.96] but later I told her what the doctor had said, Shumail sister
[584.88] I know such things makes angry, but now everything is over, isn't it? Please
[592.40] don't be worried. I am not worried and now there is nothing like this between us
[600.00] and now you have to be happy and I have to keep you happy, if you need anything
[605.76] then just tell me. You both have to live like a sister in the house
[612.56] till the child is born. I have also hired a maid and I will explain
[619.16] to her to take care of your food and drink. And if you feel like eating any special thing,
[624.72] then tell without any hesitation. I feel like eating curry since morning.
[632.48] Okay, I will get it made for you
[657.84] [Music]
[709.72] Murad Bhai, for a few days, we
[711.40] are related to you, and after all, I am also auntie of your child. Mother and
[717.48] I want to celebrate the happiness of Zarka. Can't we meet her? Who said that you guys can't
[723.24] meet? Of course you can meet, come in the evening. Okay?
[730.08] Thank you Murad Brother. We will come in the evening. You welcome!
[746.12] Pari had called, she wanted to meet, so I said, they all can come in the evening,
[754.28] You have taken permission from Shumail sister? Don't worry about it,
[762.44] Thank you Murad!
[767.72] It's okay
[775.49] [music] 
[781.92] Oh Allah, you have heard this prayer. Listen to me just one more time, don't let me
[790.76] go anywhere from here, never ever.
[811.80] Look Chanda, such precious things around, Zarka's destiny has opened. Seems all imported items.
[818.24] Hey, what are you doing, don't touch? I am just watching. The thing will break. And if it is broken then
[825.40] where will your mother bring it from? Sit down.
[831.24] Zarka Bibi is calling her mother and sister.
[837.16] She is the aunt, she has also come to meet Zarka. I don't
[842.28] know, Badi Madam has said that call her mother and sister,
[848.84] It's okay, you go, I'll wait. What Chanda, all three of us come together, how can I
[856.80] leave you and go? Asalam alikum Madam, Walikum asalam.
[862.76] Suriya, you take Zarka's mother and sister, I want to talk to you about something,
[870.36] Okay, you go, Madam wants to talk to me. Okay.
[879.72] Please sit down.
[887.16] This is a great deed of Allah. He has given us great happiness. Our wish has been fulfilled
[895.32] But do you remember the deal that was decided? Yes!
[901.00] Because today, what is the name of that boy, Whisky, he has misbehaved very much
[908.76] with Murad. Please explain to him
[913.20] and also keep in mind that this daily coming and going is not right, especially
[919.68] for that boy
[922.16] The person who came with him? Habib ...
[929.08] Lafrah. Yes, him
[932.08] You are understanding me?
[937.20] Yes, I am understanding
[941.60] Okay, you sit, Suraiya will take you to Zarka.
