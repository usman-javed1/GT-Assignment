Leave it, tell me why do you bring flowers in the morning. Your work starts at night. You don't know anything about flowers, they are not available in the evening. We buy in morning, keeping them fresh till the evening is my art, you don't know about flowers. The flowers that live here, they are enough for me, this Champa, Chambeli Yasmine, they are enough to make my life difficult.  Love birds are sitting here. Getting massage in the morning. Okay khan enough your work will be done. Where were you Lafra last night? He was guarding Chanda's brothel. Robbers were coming there? Don't talk nonsense, bring smoke for   I will give you such energetic thing that you will become a rocket, but there is one condition. What is the condition? Get me married to Zeenat Amaan Have you gone mad? Courtesan don't get married. I am not talking about that marriage, I am talking about the marriage certificate which they make to escape from the police. I am trying to protect Zeenat Amaan's future. What if any new police officer come, than I can say Zeenat Amaan is my wife  Have you seen your face? She will not marry you, she will not even do fake marriage with you, she will hit you on the head with shoes. I am not talking to you Phoolan I am talking to Lafra.

Lafra was telling that the deal was done for Rs 10000. By the way, 10k is less  You are worth selling in lakhs.  If I was at your place, would have never agreed for 10,000? Well, leave come on, give me money.  I have not taken the money. What are you saying? You have not taken the money.  If you had told me, I would have made him pay every single penny. I didn't let him get down until he pay in full. He had given me the money, but I didn't took. What and why didn't you take the money? Because I don't want to be sold. Hey, have you gone mad? What happened mother? Why are you shouting? I am cursing my fate. Leave me alone. Get out of my room  Let's go Zeenat, I will extort every penny from Lafrah otherwise my name is not even Husna This audacity of yours, that you stand under my roof  and tell your mother the story of your and a  courtesan and force us to accept your decision. If you fall in love with that woman, remember one thing. I will never hand over my future generation  to that woman. Not at any cost Before I lose my cool I want you to leave the house What are you looking at? Get out. Mehmood? Just get out of here. Get the hell out of here. Here all these women look the same. Lafray  come here. Shall I come Husna Bai? Get lost! I am talking to Lafrah, Come up I want to talk to you. I am coming in a minute. Come quick. coming just in a minute. What do you think that only girls should be looked at? How did I know that this boy is like this?   No one knows the future. Even if you had come to know, what would you have done? Because of these apprehensions  it is said that one should keep a close eye on the child.  I will not stay here anymore, leave him on his own.  listen to me Mehmood, he is not sensible, he is stuck in a quagmire, if we leave him like this, then he will be ruined. Don't say anything. What do you think he will improve if we stay here?  what's the matter? You are looking very angry. Whom did you bring yesterday? A customer What happened? Did he run away with the Chanda? Who would run away with someone like her? You had made a deal of Rs 10,000, right? Give me 10000. Oh yes yes take 10000 Take from Chanda, he must have given it to her. Ask for my commission from her. You are a liar Chanda refused, She didn't get any money. What are you talking about. Chanda did not take money?  Hey Chanda, come here. What's the matter?  You did not take money from customer? No. Why? No one takes money from their future husband Have you gone mad, what do you think, will he marry you? Why are you not understanding me. She is not a courtesan. Uncle has thrown you out of the house for right. You are a stupid man, you don't even think that if you take her out of the house as your wife, then you will find 10 such men who would have seen her dancing and singing. Life does not end with that one woman, I will show you such courtesans that you will be astonished and  is she going to marry you? After marrying you, her business will be ruined, she will not do business. Why aren't you guys listening to me seriously? Okay. Tell me. Well , when I went to her room, she started crying. She told me that she doesn't want all this. She didn't even take money from me. They take money for spending the night there, right? She didn't take money from you because she has confirmed you. This is their business. They traps someone in their net. That poor guy keeps bearing her expenses for four-six months. No Zahid, you don't know  what I have seen in her eyes was not at all like what is in the eyes of courtesan, you guys don't want to support me, don't do I came here because you guys are my friends, you will support me, get me married to her I have made a promise to her that I will come back. And I will definitely fulfil this promise, you understand I am no more a Courtesan. Why? You have wings now? Maybe, and if it doesn't come out, then they will come out soon. If you are back from your dream than listen, after three days, Sultan Khan's has Program at his house Mother said that you will go too. I won't go, Why? Why you will not go? This is the drama that you do, and now that is over. The night which you had saved for so long has passed away [music] I said I will not go Just watch, I will send her. We will marry him and settle him, but he is trapped in very bad company and look at me, I have committed to Khadija. What should I say to her and your father is very upset. Your father says that he will not stay here even for a minute, go back to America immediately, but what should I do, I can't leave my son here and I know that he will never come to America. He is also my child [Music] Hello yes son, Stay blessed.  now it's decided that we are going back  No, instead of trying to explain to me, you yourself understand that you do not have any brother  He has fooled you without giving money, he wiped his hands silently and Shut up. He put bundle of money in front of me. It was I who did not take it. Well, if he had promised to marry you, then why he was giving you the money? So I can give to Husna Auntie, he said this while giving money.   They will ask for money from you but I was not going to take it. I don't know when I became so close to him. He  was a very decent man and yet very vicious. Next time he comes, please get him to talk to Champa. Don't talk nonsense about him, I just told you that he is my future husband, husband, husband sounds so strange, doesn't this word sound like 'Vodka' and 'lafrah' are being mentioned. In the papers they are our husband. This is only way to escape from the law, Chanda, in this way you will be saved from the law, Maybe he is also thinking like Lafrah and Vodka. If you both want to do this kind of nonsense, then get away from here, I don't want to talk to you, Oh Chanda, look what I bought for you. He wants to talk to you, Chanda ji. Why is this the time, this is not the time for business, not even dancing or singing. Zeenat Amaan is not here, I have tried to make him understand but he wants to talk to you. Why?  I don't want to talk. Get lost. Wait, don't send him back. We are here to serve Come handsome, let's go. Lafray, who you bought? who has brainwash our Chanda? Take her to an exorcist. Oh my! What happened? What happened to you? Whose words are you believing? These kind of people come and have this kind of dialogues. They say that when these people come, they want to trap people like you so that people like you can feel their own. These are ways to trap people and there is nothing else. It is not like that, I also see them every day,  I recognise the lust in their eyes. Shehram was not a customer, he had come due to the jokes and taunts of his friends. Look, he has given me a ring. Take it off, it is a manly ring. No Lafray, this is his promise when he had promised, he will come back then gve it to me and I will wait for him all my life
