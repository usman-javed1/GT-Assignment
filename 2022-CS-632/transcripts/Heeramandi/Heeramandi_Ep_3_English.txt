Are you ready to support me? I am ready to support you in every way, if it is proved that Chanda is really yours, I will get you married and I am also ready to keep both of you in my house till your parents agree. She is mine. Yes, she is yours, don't mind but let me tell you one thing, if I prove that Chanda was someone else last night. Asalam alekum Shehram brother, thank God, I saw you here. Actually Chanda has send a message for you. You know that we have made a big deal with you, no cheating with you Don't talk nonsense, I had given her money, she refused it because she ... You know why she refused? She want to take 20 instead of 10, this is the issue. By the way, you never came back. Lafrah, tell me that Chanda is really waiting for Shehram? I mean last night was she waiting for Shehram or someone else? She was definitely waiting. I mean, you have to pay money but then she went to someone else, our work was done as he payed double money. He was an honest man, a very honest man. Our Golden Jubilee is complete Shehram! Sir, my food? I will bring you food. Hey, come here. This is the file of this house  and I have transferred this house in the name of Shehram and apart from this, I have also transferred enough money to his bank account. that if he wants to do any business then he can do it. Whatever he has done, according to the law, I should have disown him, You know why did I not do this? I did not do it because one day I will die. Apart from that, I have to satisfy myself too, I just want you to tell him this thing properly, from today onwards we have no relation with him, neither with me nor with his mother. Uncle, please listen to me Now don't say that you want to favour him, You want to favor him on such a bad thing? I am not favouring, I am just saying that when children do not get attention at home, when no one listens to them. They search for love outside. Love can't be measured. All the parents in the world love their children. Mehmood, don't say that. You never hugged him lovingly. Didn't ever talk to him nicely. Don't talk non sense, he is not a child, whom should I carry in my arms and love him. How shamefully he was asking to marry him to a courtesan and you want me to talk to him nicely? Welcome Sir, We were waiting for you  Hey, you are here empty hand? What do you mean by this. I mean you should have brought some gajras, fruits, sweets, a pair of clothes for me and Zeenat Amaan, at least.  You are very greedy Husna. No sir, I am not greedy, I am just demanding our rights, Yusuf. Yes sir, take this and flowers, sweets, gajras, whatever you get, and bring it, Okay sir, don't worry, I will be back in no time Husna Bai has fulfilled her promise, saved the Chanda for you, she was so arrogant.   I will take out her arrogance. I like arrogant people I have habit of taking out the arrogance of big criminals. I  know how to deal. Why not Sir, Who can know better than you?  You know why she refused? Because instead of 10 she want 20 by the way, you did not turn back. I don't want money, I swear not to sell myself, now if I take the money, then the whole life I will feel embarrassed of myself. Other customer arrived, our work was done, he paid double. he was an honest man. You remember this, a girl named Chanda will be waiting for you with her eyes on the door, neither will she sleep nor will she die [Music] At our place sir, there is a celebration but Well, now it was a compulsion, Zeenat Amaan had to go with someone so she went and I am her just for you  Hurry up, keep here This is good Chanda, today have got ready very beautifully, just like a bride. [music] Take this Husna, this is your's and Zeenat's Aman's dress money. Thank you sir, it is very kind of you Now go Chanda, is waiting for you. Look, I am here. What are you doing? Why do people come here? Come on. Get out of my room. How should I go out like this? Husna Aunty, take him out from my room. How Husna Auntie will come? And why she will take me out? She herself has given you to me, By the way, she kept her promise, That's enough, leave me  I am giving you this paan, gave them to Husna Bai. Police man had sent money. Okay. Oh, Phoolan, you are being dishonest, you had promised that this time I will take paan, give it to me. Wait, what do you say. I say, they will not  let him enter, give this to me, I will give it. I am coming, stay You stay here. Hey Lafrah, this is not fair.  Asalam alikum Husna Bai, how are you? Walikum Asalam, this is sent by Phoolan.  I am saying, don't come near. Chanda? Yes, there is no need to go, give me paan and go away. It's Chanda. Yes, go now. It will take time, go, But Husna Bai ... I said to you ... Get Lost! Husna Bai .... You going or .... Leave me. Stop this or I will shoot you? I understand, I will shoot Sir, who is this? Sir, it is wireless. DSP sir is reaching the police station. You go I am coming. Yes sir. You show great decency, I will take out all your decency and keep you in jail for the rest of your life, otherwise change my name. Go, threaten someone else with jail, I will die but not with you  Hey, what happened sir?  Listen to me carefully Okay? You have gone mad?  You will send all courtesans to jail, they all will tear you apart. He was so angry. He will destroy you now. What will he do? Will he put me in jail? Let him do. Will he kill me? I am not afraid of anyone. You also remember one thing, in the future if you send anyone to my room, there is no one worse than me. He will take it out now you arrogance [Music] [Music]  You have lighter? Weather is pleasant today. There should be something to enjoy this weather. Yes. Do you want it? What do you mean? Where is the girl? Not here, sir. If you come with us then I will show you First, show me. I will show you there. Let's go. You have enough money. it Is this work possible without money? Your glasses clicked me that there is something in you. I am waiting for you. Why you are sitting like this? it has been so many days, your lover has not come and your busy in looking at his gift you are looking as if you will rub the ring and suddenly he will come out of it. Leave this, Chanda, these stories of love and affection. happens in novels only. Everyone wants something from you. Stop crying now and back to business, if you had been with us yesterday, you would have earn something Although they were all useless, but me, Champa and Babra earned 3000 each only for dancing in one night, Leave it Zeenat Amaan, what is the use of telling her. Dil Ara died and left her burden on us She is the bone in the throat, neither we can spits nor swallows [Music] [ Song ] [Song] [Song]  What are you doing Vodka?  Acting like a courtesan. Bari Amma, I wish I too was a courtesan, instead of taking rents from you, I would have danced in the night and make money. Seriously Babra, next time you take me with you, I will apply make up and wear girls clothes, the customer won't be able to know which is the real thing. Look at him. Champa he is trying to destroy our business. He is looking like a girl with make-up. Go away from here. I had come to talk to Amma, Amma, increase the rent, inflation has increased, Survival is difficult, petrol has become Rs.50 kilos. You have gone crazy? what will you do with so much money? You eat lunch with me and dinner at Chanda's place or with Lafrah? What is the need for you? Just do this, stop drinking petrol. I don't drink petrol. Then what will you do? Drive a car on petrol? Petrol has become expensive. Okay, enough now. I am having a headache, it's so hot outside. Should I come in the evening? Yes. Hey, leave my scarf. [Song] Asalamalikum Husna Bai. Walikumsalam, come, Sit. I am here just to ask My friend Shehram came here? Why will he come here? We have good clients for our Chanda. Where is Shehram? No, I have come to see that he has come here or not? I just told you that he has not come here.  Sir, listen to me, I am looking for Shehram, does he have any number? Chanda, he is already married. He has gone out of the country, I just came to see if he came here before leaving. Hey, if he has gone out of the country, then how will he come here Okay, I am leaving, Allah Hafiz [Music] I heard that the man, Chanda was waiting for the one who had promised to marry her has gone out of country after getting married, Zeenat told me. Chanda is mentally disturbed. She don't know that no one loves us. Hey Amma, she must not have seen that movie Umrao Jaan Ada, otherwise she doesn't wait. She was waiting like Umrao Jan Ada, she must have seen the film, I have heard that all the ashes have fallen off, Husna was saying that now she is ready to dance also. Definately, after all it is a question of the sinful stomach. Yes it is the stomach that forces a person, Hey Why are you sitting here reading magazine? Go make tea for me and listen add extra milk in it. Okay than? Auntie and uncle are very tense. I am here since morning, don't tell his mother that he is missing, you know that she will get worried, Then? you just say that he is with a friend Okay, it's fine if he is with a friend. Then it's fine, thank you Zahid, it's also good that we know where he is. Okay, Allah Hafiz What happened? He is at a friend's house, Zahid has tried to explain a lot but he is not ready to come. You relax and go. I promise, I will send him back to America    [Music] [Music] Why are you standing? Kulsom, your son will not come. because he will come after we leave to bring that courtesan to this house, the house needs to be empty, It's flight time. We are getting late, come, let's go come, there is no use of wasting your time, Allah Hafiz  and take good care of yourself, come. You go, I am coming I have only your support,  Iflooks tall, keep one thing in mind, don't let him marry in Tawaf, son, explain to him that the honor of the family is not to be taken away in the market like this. Look, how proudly and respectfully we have lived in this house. Lest he turn this house into a hut, Sahara, son, my only hope is in Allah and you. I know you will make him understand. And see, when he gets angry, he does not eat food for many days. Kulsoom, it is getting late, please. Come quickly [Music] [Applause] [Music] No house keys [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] Son, where were you thinking about him? Do you have any idea about someone's problem? How worried were you? Amma, do you know what has happened to us, if you had not met us, but at least you would have told us where you were, at least you would not have gone crazy searching for us, where was everyone, with that wife, she had hidden you or you somewhere. Had taken her somewhere [Music] Tell me, haven't you married her? Tell me, haven't you married her? Have you come here after getting her drunk? Open me, open me, dry me. If you can go there, you can drink alcohol too, right? I don't drink alcohol or even go to the music [music]. In your eyes, there is no Tawaf, what is its name? Only the body is not sold. Every bad habit is sold there to control men, but what difference does it make to you? If it is not yours then consider your mother, think about what she must have gone through, how much she has been crying. My heart wanted to take her straight to the place where you are debauchering you in such a condition. If you see, maybe their hearts will find peace. Close the door, where are you going [Music] Home takes too long, people are gone [Music] America, all men are the same Chanda, you are still a child, you have nothing to do with them right now There was the first man who came into your life, you made him disrespectful. Every person who comes here declares that he will sacrifice his life for us, will leave his home, will marry and take us home, but all this is exempted from this brothel. The first step is taken outside and one forgets everything. Here no one belongs to anyone else, why don't we give money, why can't anyone be ours? What crime have we committed and I, I don't even talk to anyone, you know, I could have asked Sumi, I could have gone to the locality and asked some other girl about me, if she had found something wrong with me or she Had it been known that I was meeting someone else, I would have left the lie. Why did he lie? No one tells me the truth. Mother also died talking like this. She lived her whole life hoping that someone would come to marry her. Will take him but no one has come, his dead body has gone from this very brothel. Look son, people like us are not destined to have a husband and a home. Take care of yourself [Music] I know it hurts a lot, those who give pain go away and never come back. Tears coming, don't even go to ask, go to sleep, it's too late, I just went there on the advice of my friends, you won't believe but for the first time in my life, I went to the brothel of a Tawaf, I liked it, the second Tawaf. She told me that she doesn't want to be sold, she wants to get married [sangeet] And you, like an idiot, offered her marriage without even thinking about who you are, what is your family background, has anyone ever told you in your childhood? I have never seen the face of such a place and you had gone to marry her. Has the ghost descended? It would have been better if it had descended two days earlier. Now only one thing can be done - you go to America, I will not go to America. You know brother, I like you very much. No, they created so much hatred for me in Amma Abba's heart, no one has done anything, everything happened because of your actions [Music] I am going, where are you going home, stay here, go in the morning, Rehman's clothes are food. I had eaten, I had eaten, okay, if you want tea or coffee, please let me know, if I fell asleep then I will not be able to get up again, no, I am fine, it is enough for me that you are caring for me so much, don't talk too much.
