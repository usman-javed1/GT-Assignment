[53.96] Shehram, get up, it's time for the flight, it's late
[66.96] [Music]
[70.36] Shehram, let's not go anywhere. Stay here 
[75.88] I am ready to stay here, you are in a hurry to go to London
[80.98]  Yes
[86.20] even here I will be scared. Scared of what? 
[92.76] What if again you started feeling scared with society
[98.32] Fear of what people will say, fear of someone seeing us, there
[105.20] is no such thing as society in London. Now I am not afraid of anything,
[109.52] so it is your choice, miss the flight or else get ready quickly.
[115.32] What's the time? If we  missed the flight then everyone
[121.04] will be left stranded, we have only one hour, if you have not packed, do it quickly,
[126.92] I will be back from washroom in just 10 minutes 
[133.32] And yes, thank you in advance for coming with to London forever. 
[152.24] Come auntie, have tea, you have not eaten anything since the morning. No, Chanda
[160.68] I don't feel like eating anything. Bring me one more pill for headache. I feel like
[168.60] a burden. Aunt if you takes the pill on an empty stomach, it will cause burning
[176.56] Hey Lafrah, any information about Vodka? I don't know where he is,
[183.60] whether he is alive or not. I have lost my mind, my
[188.76] legs are becoming weak while walking. I swear to God,
[195.28] You want tea? Yes, give me. Hey, why don't you go to shrine and look,
[202.92] last time also we found him at the shrine. I was sitting at the shrine
[207.60] I have been searching for him for eight days, he has been missing for eight days
[210.84] and Phoolan also closed his shop in the evening and went away. Hey Phoolan had opened the shop but
[216.84] was sitting idle, he didn't even make gajras. A man came and was asking about a Vodka.
[222.96] Phoolan went with him. How did you know? I was with him. 
[229.52] Someone might have come to ask, stop worrying about Vodka,
[232.48]  worry about yourself, Vodka will come after sometime.
[235.52] He has us only in the entire world
[241.68] For whom it has come?
[247.08] Lafray, you were looking for Vodka, I have found him
[253.96] him.
[257.57] [Music]
[261.56] O my dear, our friend is gone. Open it. where will I
[273.68] bring him from. From where Phoolan will bring Vodka
[283.28] Hey move, move
[287.36] Who is it?
[293.36] [Music] 
[300.24] He drowned in sea
[316.50] [Music] 
[326.17] [Music]
[336.79] [Music]
[345.68] Hey Chanda, for how long will you survive by sewing? Hey, now
[352.96] your son has become young, he is running Rikhshaw, why don't you take his earnings,
[358.60] He earns illegal. I will not take from him, my livelihood is done, what do you
[367.16] think, I don't know, even today he brings customers for courtesan in his Rickshaw 
[372.92] look at the life styles of the courtesan, they live in big bungalows,
[376.24]  he has relations with them,
[379.24] He bring customers for your daughters too. Chanda, don't talk nonsense to me,
[385.48] my girls don't do illegal business dancing or singing, they have to do for living.
[390.52]  
[393.32] I had made a big mistake by not going back home.
[397.28] I said to you to go back
[399.28] I wish I had gone, my girls would not have been here.
[403.40] Whatever happened is in front of you, till date I have not seen my siblings
[409.60] I think not even one of them has thought that the sister
[415.16] who earned for us, where she has gone? They had searched for me, you
[421.20] look for me around. Forget it, this world is selfish, and this creates courtesan.
[429.24] You are right, Chanda. I came to you for a work.
[438.40] Talk to Whiskey, he should marry Zarka. At Least I will be free from one girl's
[445.36] responsibility. What do you think? I have not explained it to him,
[447.84]  I have told him a thousand times, he doesn't even listen to me.
[453.84]  He ignore this topic. Now we
[457.48] can't force him.
[463.12] If anyone tries to force me, then see, I am telling you, Lafrah, I will not marry Zarka,
[469.72]  tell my mother. Either she doesn't meet me, if she meet, then it's only one thing,
[474.20] get married. Say to mother break this engagement, even Zarka also smiles
[480.52] after seeing me, I don't like this. Hey,
[486.52] your engagement was fixed by Zeenat.
[493.28] She herself died, and put this noose around my neck.
[497.36] You also used to say that I will marry Zarka. I was so small that time
[504.36] at least you all should think once. She is a very nice girl,
[510.80]  Guddu, you will not get any doctor in your life, marry her. I don't know Lafray,
[518.96] My heart does not want.
[522.92] Hey, What kind of trouble is with Aslam.
[529.52] You went to him? He was not there.
[534.68] Hello, yes, there was no credit in my phone, tell me.
[542.68] Okay, I will bring the girl. Hey, tell your master, if he sees her dancing, he
[550.32] will keep watching. I swear, then she will add more colour to your party.
[557.56] She dances in such a way that everyone starts dancing. Talk to your boss.
[562.84] If he didn't like than I will return the money Hey, people die to see her dancing.
[569.76] Yes, I swear.
[571.80]  Look Chanda, look what I have brought for you.
[577.84] Hey Chanda,
[581.56]  
[585.28] What has happened, why are you making so much noise?
[588.88]  Look what I have brought for you to eat. Come let's eat food, 
[593.88] where did you bring it from? Oh God, I swear it is not by illegal work, come
[599.88] eat. Guddu had given you the money? No 
[606.84]  I have brought it from my own. Nowadays, with your blessings, the shop
[612.52] is running very well. Oh come on, hurry up, bring the plate,
[618.92] listen to me, see, somehow I have spend my life, yours
[627.28] has also passed, you don't feel the pain sometimes?
[633.12] It's over now, no use of talking about it. Senseless people also live, I also lived.
[643.20] Shall I ask you one thing Chanda?
[646.92] My life is ruined because of loneliness. You are not afraid of loneliness?
[655.96] sometimes person's past life becomes the support of living
[661.92] this is my support too
[666.52] You have not forgotten him, right? 
[674.84] Come on, bring food. Let's eat food, come on, eat food, come
[683.80]  I don't know whether Guddu has eaten or not. He will eat
[688.56] He is going to the function with Pari and Zarka, he will manage.
[694.52] He will eat there. Bring quick and bring water too.
[704.88] Mother, I am was very tired. I swear, there
[710.68] were very stingy people. They paid only 2000. Tell Whiskey to
[718.32] settle the money in advance and only then I will go. That's why I don't work so hard. Hey,
[723.96] what is the benefit of killing your life, mother now you also leave Ustad ji. We get
[729.56] hardly two to four thousand rupees, out of that, he takes 2000 for himself,
[734.44] 1000 to 1500 paid to Tabla master. Tell her leave classical and learn disco dance.
[740.92] Nowadays, it is the era of disco dance. Why do you get what you get
[745.80] by going to these disco parties? Last time I brought only 5000. Mother, tell her. These
[752.20] disco parties are organized by very big rich people. They spend day and night
[757.40] playing with money. Pari is right. Nowadays, it
[763.28] is the era of senseless dance. All these people like this. Hey mother, you are
[769.16] calling disco dance senseless. Wait. I am playing a song
[774.12] and show you a nice item. What's the problem, Pari,
[779.52] have you come after listening to so much noise? Are you not tired yet? 
[782.92] Hey, why am I getting tired? You have danced there,
[784.96]  you always keep ordering me. Now I I will not share room with you,
[790.48] Don't share
[795.18] Mother, now I will not stay in the room with her,
[800.56] She does not let me do anything, neither listen to songs, nor does she let me read the magazine.
[805.20] If I play song, she says turn it off. I am having headache. When I read, she says
[810.36] turn off the light, I want to sleep. Why do you keep reading these novels all the time?
[815.88] I just told you, pick up your things and go to her room, give me your room,
[822.52] at least I I will be able to decorate it as per my wish, I will put up these big posters,
[829.12] I feel like I have to do this only.
[835.00] I feel relieved.
[851.68] Hey Lafrah, I talked to my mother? Why
[856.88] is she angry with me? Even today, I keep knocking at the door?
[860.76] She did not open it. She is angry with you. Why? What have I done?
[868.24] I gave you the money, she returned it, then
[872.32] you sent the same money with Hema Auntie, she did not take it. What she want?
[878.36] Guddu, she came to know that you are sending customers to
[884.08] Hyderabad and bring girls from Hyderabad and you know that she
[890.60] doesn't like this work. Why don't you listen to us? Zarka and Pari
[898.20] are dancing for you, you get a good commission, I have given you a new Rickshaw.
[904.12] Why are you not earning legal money? That's what I do
[908.48] I send all legal money to mother. what is the matter, why doesn't she listen?
[911.80] What should I do?
[917.84]  Tell me one thing, how is my mother?
[924.16] She is not well, Guddu. I meet her, she seems 
[931.32] down, like dry flower. She is a very nice woman and a very good woman,
[941.04] she has lived in this locality with great respect, I swear to God, since childhood, she
[947.44] wanted to take you away from here, but it was not in her hand. 
[952.60] Guddu she doesn't like this work,
[960.72] she wanted you to be a big man, people respect you. Oh friend,
[967.20] Stop this. Since childhood, I have been listening this speech every day.
[971.96] What Respect? let me tell you one thing, I have good respect, at least here. Someone
[977.96] calls for a girl, I clearly refuse, I say that we do not do illegal work 
[982.64] Singing and dancing is art. Tell me one thing, sometimes, I think I
[991.32] should establish a relationship with a TV person once Zarka gets the work.
[996.68] Hema Auntie says that we will leave all this and go somewhere far away and I will also
[1001.36] take mother to her.
[1005.32] You sit here for a minute, I am coming. Listen to me Guddu, don't
[1014.00] go to your mother, she will get angry.
