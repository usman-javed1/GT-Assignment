Today I have sent Vatka to get customers. He brings very good and strong customers who are not even poor. Champa will eat you. She says that Vatka brings customers only for us. Oh wow, what has Vatka bought, he has given commission. She gives it, we will also give it, okay tell me for how long will Hema remain angry with Champa, I will not talk to her for the rest of my life, I am not going to forgive even if I die, and Zeenat, do you keep taking the name of that wretched person again and again, okay leave it in front of me, tell me. What are you wearing today? You have to prepare well today. A very strong customer is coming. He is coming with Vatka. Akh ladi bad badi [Music] Excuse: You are a shameless unemployed person by giving a job and doing shamelessness here. The name of the family is Ti, you are a child. Leave it to me girl, who are you and get out of here, leave me in such a disrespect, why didn't you come to ask me whether I am alive or not, keep quiet, don't talk nonsense, who is he, he is my uncle's son, he is my relative, look at his face, he is mine. Relatives are like this, relatives are like this, after the death of our parents, they did not even look back at us. I and my sister and brother remained hungry for a whole week, kept dying, where did they go then, so much disrespect, then they talk nonsense while sitting in the kitchen, you don't even feel ashamed. I am ashamed, not this, you should be ashamed. Today, when the disgrace of this family is visible, it was not visible when these people were thrown on the streets and dying. Come on, get out of here, this is not your house of nobles, where they raise hands on women. If I touch this girl here, I will break her hands and legs and put them in my pocket. Come on, get away from here, I could not even imagine that you can be so disrespectful, Rihanna. Hey, go, you have come to do a very good deed. Keep quiet here, now if you step there or else I will kill you, I died for you and you for us, you were already dead for us and from today your brothers and sisters also died for you and I will tell you, Abba. I will go and tell you, oh Amma, talk to Lafe and call him, we will get him out by hitting him. Bhai Garat Bhai, I cannot give the remaining two rotis, but because of the risk, he has come to kick me. Hey, why are you crying, Hima, just tell me about this. I was afraid, how did I know that this man would come to this place, uncle, I am not afraid of him, he will not let Sultana Gagar meet me, who is Sultana, she is my sister, with whom I have left my brothers and sisters, sister me. Oh, I won't let him see his face [laughter] Why didn't you tell me, my friend, I would have taken out his wick-like arm and given him ashes. Oh go, both of them were amazing and died. Hosana brother, I had taken the child with me and you were crying. Oh! Listen, you should have stopped him here, oh why didn't you stop here, he is doing wonders here, friend, you were a customer, I was a customer, oh you should have given a call to Phoolan Phoolan, ok ok let's go and get buried, by the way, where is this Hema, she has been awake the whole night. Sister has been crying remembering her brothers, she is sleeping now, I don't feel like waking her up and it is good, uncle has taken the sister, he will get the brothers, you yourself will come to know what cradle is, Hema lost her life. As long as the customer is here, you guys stay downstairs, there is no need to take Guddu to the shell. Oh, I had taken Guddu to the shell so that when Chanda dances, he will cry. Oh no, if you take him, you will sit in front and watch. By the way, where is brother Chada, she is also awake with Hima all night, she is sleeping, just listen brother, I came to tell you that Imtiaz Sahab has given a useful gift, his daughter has got off, Kach Pup Kach Pup, how did you know that he is gone? I was with Imtiaz Ali Khan and he said, SHO, take care of us all, we will take care of everyone, now you have told me very good news, see, I did not say this but I used to stay awake the whole night in trouble, oh that you are worried about your mother. You trapped me, otherwise it was good news, so I had come to give you all, now you all rest comfortably, ok then let 's go, let's go, Raab Rakha [Music] [Praise] [Music] Hey Champa, you haven't eaten Amma's bread yet. The branch has come, otherwise it will break your face. And what is this? Why have you taken out my clothes? Will you wear them in the evening? I will iron them. Good, big love is coming on me. This is a very precious pair of mine. Keep it with dignity. Beware of anyone who touches you. And I went and made Amma's roti and became a great queen. Yes, I will make it [Music] What happened to you [Music] It is better if I die so that I will be spared from these tortures, I thought, Chanda, if this is what I have to do, then I have to stay here. Let it happen, I pray to Allah that you are a daughter, why do you talk like this, you also have a family, go to them and they will accept you, my love Chanda, they will not accept me. You will do it, you don't know them anyway, what will I do by going there, hey, who will marry me, I have just decided that since I have to stay here, this is what I have to do, then let it happen, my child will also grow up like Guddu [Music] Why have you all come here? If Champa wants to make friends with you, will you force me? Yes, no, he himself has said that he should make friends with you [Music] Do it, it was my mistake, I know, forgive me, I am sorry. Come on, Ma, she is apologizing. End that conversation and hug me, let 's go, I consider you like my sister, I have always considered you my sister, that is why I am saying, please forgive me, come with me, now I don't know what has happened to you, Chachanda, my heart is very heavy today. It is full of Hema, that and there was a song that we used to sing, so tell us which one today, if we miss the party, don't cry if we miss the party, if we miss the party, don't cry, you console the heart. Don't ever get scared, don't cry, we are leaving the party [Music] [Music] [Music] Hey, don't you sleep, go to sleep, just sleep here, yes Amma, I am going to sleep, Amma Amma, please forgive me [Music] [Music] Khuda Hafiz Bagra I don't know whether I will ever be able to see you again or not. Forgive me [Music] S [Music] [Music] Oh hey, you have come, you have brought a big new model car, you too are my new model. Hey Chamak, let's go, sit quickly, come quickly, come Lafra or Vatka, otherwise they will take away my life. Bring the luggage, yes, everything is there, you will need some cash also and you will have to stay in Lahore for a few days. Oh Baba, everything has been kept. Come on or you will be caught [Music] Peepal leaves [Music] Come on from here, go inside, go inside, why did I come and why did I come and forbid you? Then why did I come? Tell me, please forgive me, Amma, I will not come again. Amma, please forgive me, I will never come, I don't want you to see everything, why don't you listen, why don't you agree with me, Amma, I was standing outside watching and those people sitting inside were watching, don't do nonsense, come and see me. Show me there, I will gouge out your eyes, I will break your leg [Music] I had come asking you to sleep, you have to wake up early for school, you have to study Kutu, we don't want to stay here, don't do this work, don't want to see anything, your elder one Before it happens, we should go away, but fate does not support us. This dancing and singing is not the work of the nobles, so why do you dance? Why do they pay? How many times have I told you to mind your own business? Why does everyone watch? Everyone sees something, why do you refuse me [Music] Ho Gu, I don't want you to see everything, I don't want us to stay here, but what should I do, son, I am very helpless, I don't even want to dance [Music] I want you to grow up I have to become a very big man [Music] Okay Guddu, now I will not dance, I will never dance
