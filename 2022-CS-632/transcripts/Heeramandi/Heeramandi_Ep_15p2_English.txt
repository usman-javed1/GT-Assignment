Come here, you also take some Show some dance Vodka, I am very happy today. I feel as from my heart all burden is washed away. I will leave this world with many sins, but when mother promised me  that she would never do anything wrong  then my heart felt relax  and when Chanda and Hema agreed for Whisky and Zarqa's wedding, I felt that I had paid for my all sins Today I have got everything, I have got everything, your dreams has also been fulfilled and mine too Hey, Zeenat marrying me was your dream too? Always ... I use to tease you. I was scared of mother.   It's every woman dream that she should belong to only one person and that one person belongs to her only. she make family with him and make his house a paradise  I just want that I wish I could say this to every courtesan that don't do this work for the sake for your bread and butter Non of the woman has to do this work for the sake of her living. It becomes a big torture They suffer in this world and in the hell also. Here hell too and there hell too  Look at me when I will die. Oh no dear you will not die. I am getting your treatment, I have prayed a lot for you. I have prayed a lot and I have ask for forgiveness from God and it is not all your fault, dear What is your fault? We ourselves have instigated you to commit crimes and if the customers do not come here, then such areas will not exist. Man comes, that's why women commit crimes  I think that why do these respectable people leave their respectable wives at home and come here to get? What do they get, what do they leave behind? Sins, sorrows, diseases and  people like me. Punishment for this, we deal with big losses, dear and this is neither any benefit to them nor any benefit to us, just we carry the burden of our sins all our life and we just keep on moving like this and one day, everything ends. Everyone has to die friend, one day everyone will leave the world. But I will not let you die. I have prayed a lot for you dear, If you die, I won't survive either,  how can I stay alive without  you. You can't die ... Zeenat?   You must be tired We had fun filled day. You must be tired now. Take some rest We have to go out also, Lafrah has invited for dinner in hotel Take rest Have make preparation to go to Lahore also, Will visit shrine there, will pray there. I had asked for a wish.

You must be tired, take some rest You will be fine You will be treated You will be fine Take some rest You will be fine. Take some rest You must be tired Is it good? Try yourself. It is bitter, you did not told me I have to add sugar in it. I was waiting for this time,   it's still bitter. It is strong for me   Will you be able to spend your life with me? Have you ever looked at me carefully? In the last few years, I have grown even more. Perhaps there is no more life left in me like it is in you. You are insisting to marry? Have you thought how far will Zaira be able to run with you? What if you move ahead and I will remain standing behind, neither will I be able to call you nor will I be able to run to you   15 years ago, when I saw you for the first time, exactly You look exactly like you look today. I have been searching for this Zaira for so many years [Music] [Music] Coffee... Shall I order more? Are you sure? Now enough   Oh my dear, My son What happened Vodka? Oh my dear, you accept that she is dead, Zeenat is dead, we all have to die, who remains alive till the doomsday. But before leaving, she has improved everyone.  Vodka, Zeenat has paid for all sins Hey Vodka,  Are you listening to us or not? Your wife is dead.  She loved you very much. When a person, who loves you most goes away a man should cry. Cry my dear.
