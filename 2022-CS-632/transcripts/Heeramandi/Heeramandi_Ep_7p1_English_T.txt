[0.00] [Music] Zahira's brother-in-law Rehaan called your father
[2.72] and told him, "I am telling you to immediately throw him out of your house, Amma. You know her in-laws very well.
[8.28] You also know what kind of person Rehaan is and I
[14.72] have also been in love with Rehaan." [Music]
[46.87] [Music] Hello
[49.48] Amma, she was asking a lot about you, we had talked to you, yes, yes, I have talked to her,
[57.84] she was very happy that you have come here, and she was telling me to be careful if it is
[66.20] more than Zaira. I got served, so now if they had come to know that you make tea
[71.40] , coffee and food for me, then I would have been scolded a lot. Are
[78.44] you going somewhere? Yes, there is a meeting, after that go through Zahid. I will come
[86.40] , it will be a little late tonight, please don't mind, okay yes, I
[96.84] said about tea, tea is being made or the pie is getting ready, I had prepared it, it will be cold, then I would have made it and
[104.32] brought it [Music]
[118.43] [Music] [Praise]
[133.92] My I have nine bangles in my hands, wait a little, sir, these
[141.48] are compulsions, wait a little, sir, these
[150.36] are compulsions, we will meet now, the distance is only for one night,
[158.48] I am tired, Ma, you know, Javed said that he
[165.92] is a producer, right? He wants me in the film. This will help. The film will be shown on such a big screen
[172.72] in the cinema and there will be a very long recording. Hi Hi, how famous will I become.
[184.08] Ouch Hi Champa, please talk to your producer for me too . I am afraid because of my family
[191.00] that they might come to know about it. What do I do here? I
[196.20] will work in the film otherwise this fear will also go away. Speak slowly,
[202.20] even the walls have ears and if Amma comes to know then she will strangulate me.
[208.76] She will talk to me dear. Alas for me, first let me make my point. Well, if
[219.16] I get a job in a film and become a heroine, then I will be free from these poor people,
[226.12] but Hima is an issue, friend, and Javed says that
[232.96] I will have to go to Lahore for recording. Yes, you. She will go so far to Lahore without telling Amma,
[239.04] now she will have to go, after all this is my hobby,
[244.96] where will I go, there is talk of where to go, no no, Amma, where to go,
[252.96] where to go Amma, I have to go to become a queen, whatever she
[259.52] knows, can't she touch the butter, Javed She has given Lara the opportunity to get work in films and dramas. She
[264.92] sits all day long and watches TV. She is learning acting, not dancing. She considers herself
[270.88] a Sridevi and that has not been seen. She sits all day long reading magazines. Oh,
[275.52] you will wear so many shoes, won't you, you bitch? The ghost of all acting will be gone from your head
[282.04] Amma, the elder heroine, by the way, if I become a heroine, then only your name will come among the noble ones,
[289.88] don't talk nonsense, don't make me get your name among the noble ones, and what is that name
[295.48] , what is the name of that man? Javed, yes, if I step on it now, I will break that bastard's legs.
[305.04] Mother, I am calling you Chanda. Yes aunty, you are dying. Sit straight,
[311.32] heroine, press my feet and let's dance. Her legs are hurting, she is
[319.92] coming back from the market. My legs don't hurt
[326.11] [music]
[331.68] Where did you go? I have been worried for so long. I had gone for some work. You have come
[337.28] home early. Don't you have to go anywhere? Why
[344.04] should you go somewhere? You were asking me just like that.
[349.16] What is the point of getting angry in this,
[353.16] I am not angry, I asked you something, you did not answer , where did you go? I can't go anywhere, that's why I am asking,
[360.16] okay, get ready, I am also going to say the same to you. It was because you
[365.08] must not have cooked the food. I went out to eat the food. I had cooked the food.
[369.80] I am asking you to get ready because some guests are coming. Who are the guests? Not your in-laws,
[377.28] your in-laws
[381.40] . It means that some people are coming
[386.68] to you. Look, I have liked a girl for you,
[390.72] Shara, you should get married now, Amma, why does anyone marry out of fear of Baba,
[398.68] but you are getting married because of their fear, aren't you ashamed,
[404.20] why are you like this on everything? You think, after all, I am not going to stay here all my life,
[410.52] where will I go? You can go anywhere, I can die,
[419.64] so can I. And who told you to look for girls for me?
[424.24] Listen to me, you take the decisions of your life on the advice of people. I ca
[429.92] n't do it out of fear Shahram, where are you going, I have called him, I don't want
[437.04] to meet anyone in the evening, Himma, please pick me up, yes, come on, I am late,
[442.60] Oi, look who has come, wow, why have you come alone, where is the customer?
[451.60] When did I say that I will bring a customer? Well, we have refused to laugh, they are
[457.88] bringing a lot of customers. I did not tell anyone that I
[461.92] will bring a customer. Look, Amma came to know that if no customer comes today, she will kill me.
[467.08] You didn't bring me the customer, so why
[472.72] did he come to talk to Zeenat?
[478.44] Ok, you want to talk to me, tell me, what do
[483.92] you want to talk about, I want to talk to you alone

[540.28] ?
[543.30] [Music] Why marriage?
[548.84] Isn't he crazy to marry you? Will Zeenat love you very much?
[556.44] Yes, I will keep you in the car, I will give you the pleasure of wives, yes, what is that,
[562.72] Chanda, listen, another lover has been born, who is my
[568.36] lover, who made you my lover, I am not talking to you, I
[575.36] am talking to Zeenat, hey Hima, this is So he is talking to me, he will marry me and
[581.76] like Chanda, I will become the mother of his children and only one woman will be left dancing in this brothel,
[586.52] that is Husna
[593.20] Bhai Zeenat, what difference does it make, marry her, yes Chanda, do you understand this? The whole life will keep dancing like this.
[601.04] Come on, I am just saying a little. Come on, we

[641.72] even if no customer comes. I will break his legs, no customer will come
[647.96] from here, I will see who comes [laughter]
[655.48] Here, you are very bad, you are crazy, you want to marry me,
[662.00] but what happened to Zeenat, if I talked to her about marriage, you are not so much fun with her.
[667.44] You should have blown it away, you yourself know Amma, I will never let my marriage take place,
[673.84] why should I see such stories which cannot be fulfilled
[679.24] ? Come uncle and everything is fine tomorrow, of course son, you
[686.68] are fine
[697.76] please Maya, you have the opportunity to meet us. There is no time, we thought that we should just meet,
[704.84] Uncle, what should I tell you, I am so busy in work, I don't get time,
[709.20] you have plenty of time, you come home in the evening and
[716.12] are seen roaming around in the car at night, would

[740.80] am a very old friend of your father, I know your entire family, the thing that your family has earned the most
[746.32] is respect [ Music]
[749.40] Uncle, but why are you saying these things to me, son, you have forced me to
[756.44] say these things to you, to make you realize that you belong to a respectable family, I have
[762.68] the sense of intelligence, you please say whatever you want to say,
[767.72] you live alone. In such a situation, it doesn't feel good that you have brought Zaira and kept me there.
[773.52] Uncle, you know her too, you know me too, I am like a sister.
[779.92] Whatever I told you, there are relationships, they are not an illusion.
[783.72] It has been many days since we stayed with her. Earlier, there was something else.
[789.80] But now it is not right for this wife to stay here. Look, it was my job to make you understand,
[796.16] so I explained further, it is your
[802.20] choice, just don't forget this, son, Sholay is like a spark, uncle,
[809.08] thank you very much for telling me, but you guys are ours.

[837.20] brother, it's good to listen, see, stubborn like a child. Don't do it friend and listen to me, Jinat
[843.76] will not marry you. Yes, don't do it. Why are you not able to understand such a small thing,
[847.88] friend? Well, listen to me for a minute , what would happen if Nath were to marry you after a while?
[853.36] All your life you will keep on giving me the pleasure of talking to her. O friend, wife is the one
[860.32] who is there for herself. Yes, oh yes, he is right. Look, even if Nat marries you, will
[867.08] she leave this business and what will happen when she gets inside? She must be singing and outside you
[873.08] must be writhing like a fish. What do you think? I will give her a job.
[877.52] I had told her earlier also that I only want to make her my wife and keep her at home.

[913.68] who was your father, who was your mother, what will I tell them, what will I tell them that my mother is a So
[919.08] I had a wife and even if I told, would he marry me? Tell me, oh my friend, oh
[930.28] my brother, here [music]
[935.72] Come here, my friend, what should I do with yours, why don't you understand that Tawaf and
[942.84] broker are one and the same ? We are the same, we have the same fate
[946.78] [Music] This Tawaf of theirs,
[952.00] carrying the plates of infamy around their necks
[957.92] , is also attached to our backs, for them these are the brothels and for us these are the brothels. I die in
[964.52] the shell, we die in the shell, this is our life
[970.54] [Music]

[1040.16] Gaya Oye
[1046.64] Batka O Ba Ke O Chai,
[1052.96] Gaya Ki Kise Mar Ga O Baat
[1057.44] People are saying wrong. Everyone knows what is the relation between me and Shehram. They are like my younger
[1063.88] brothers, earlier also we used to live like this, you know well,
[1069.84] me and Shahram also did not live like this, we, these people used to live upstairs, we look below,
[1075.80] who lives where in the Zahira house. No one can say anything about it,
[1081.76] it is better for you that you go somewhere else, where would she go and who are you
[1088.48] to give advice, Siyaram, don't be stupid, I have come to make Zaira understand, please
[1096.68] take the advice from this. I'll see who takes them out, you go, please go
[1102.07] [music] Why are you crying,
[1110.96] what else
[1115.16] should I do, Sir, send me, okay, you
[1121.72] go up, why didn't he come, just like that, now you go up,
[1128.76] tell me, I am saying. I am here, please come,
[1134.36] I will talk to him, you go [Music]
[1143.20] Yes, come
[1149.08] [Music] Sit down, tell me what do you people want Shahram,
[1156.12] what we want and you know very well, who are you, my caste,
[1161.64] the drunkard in life, the jungle. Not me, you live in a world and in this world , it is unacceptable for
[1167.40] a man and a woman to live together without any relationship.
[1172.00] You are blaming a decent woman and defaming her. If the woman is so decent then why don't you marry. Do
[1178.24] it, don't worry, I will leave this house today and
[1184.48] will not go anywhere. You heard
[1187.76] that she will not go anywhere because I am marrying her.
