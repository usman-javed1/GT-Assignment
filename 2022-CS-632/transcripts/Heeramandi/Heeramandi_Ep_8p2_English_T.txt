[0.89] [Music] You hate me so much that you
[5.36] left the house. I thought you cared about me a lot. You didn't care whether
[11.32] I ate food or not. You didn't even think that
[15.64] I would be tired when I came back. Who will give me coffee? I will make it up to whom will I talk, all this
[20.64] is not for me to do, that's why Shahram was saying, settle down your house, bring someone who will
[25.16] take care of you, don't make me take care of anyone, I will take care of myself,
[31.48] whatever you do with me. You have done a favor to me, I
[36.20] can never repay it, I have
[41.04] not done you any favor, I have expressed a wish, I have not forced you, I
[47.12] have never given you any trouble, When have I told you, you have given me trouble, but you have given me a lot of trouble.
[52.44] If you have taken care of me, I will never be able to forget this favor of yours, you
[57.96] have supported me at a time when I wanted to be supported for the whole life,
[63.76] you did not accept,
[68.28] however, you will not go anywhere from here,
[73.32] so I have to accept this Shahram. Why don't you accept that
[79.68] what you are thinking cannot happen, I have accepted that I have accepted that what I
[85.08] want cannot happen, but whenever I wanted something, it did not happen
[89.21] [Music] I have a request
[96.08] , I don't know whether I will agree
[101.92] with you I don't know what you are going to say, you are not for marriage
[109.38] [music] Kanga, but you can stay here, don't
[114.00] worry, I
[117.36] will leave from here, what are you talking about, you, I will stay here and you will leave from your house,
[122.08] I this I am not leaving my house and going to another house, I
[129.08] am going to UK
[132.88] and I don't know when
[137.00] I will return. At first I thought of not going but then I thought what will I do by staying here,
[143.88] it is better that I go. Look, if you
[149.28] are going because of me then I I am
[155.24] leaving not because of anyone but because of myself.
[159.76] What will I do by staying here? Who am I?
[164.00] Earlier I thought that you are [music]
[169.96] but you are not mine.
[180.96] You felt bad about me. Please forgive me.
[186.48] Go to aunty. Make them ready to stay with me
[192.04] [Music]
[196.28] I can't even leave you alone
[206.86] [Music]
[219.36] Yaar Lafde Yaar, come with me to the grave and pray for me, Yaar Allah I
[225.36] had heard you, but you didn't listen to me, my friend. I have prayed for you, my friend, I am a very sinful
[230.80] person. O friend, I had gone to do wonders and towards Ghazi Saheb. I have listened to him, but who
[236.56] listens to us, friend, but Ghazi Saheb listened to you but did not listen to me. Look, friend,
[241.80] not brother, take it. Go friend, take me,
[248.96] okay brother, I will take you but there is a condition, tell me or tell me, I mean,
[259.52] for a long time we have been drinking the pot of our money, this
[264.16] is not a good thing and I already knew that, that is why I I had brought it with me, I thought that when you
[271.56] promise, I will give you the pieces of my life, this is the ring, I love you
[281.74] [Music]
[307.81] [Music]
[315.59] [Music]
[328.64] O
[332.36] La La Ra Ra Ra
[346.48] [Music]
[367.43] [Music]
[380.84] Mother's Girl, have you gone mad? Yes,
[385.52] I have gone mad. It was my mouth, how did you take it? Yes, the poor people who come to the village leave it for me
[390.40] and the well-paid customers take it for themselves. You have become very smart, oh your father's
[395.44] customer . She liked me by suppressing you, you engaged her in conversation and took her away. Hey, you also had a
[401.20] client. What did you do? Hey, you kicked me away. I don't want such a client.
[406.44] You are very fast. You have girls worth Rs. 10,000. All the bangs are for me,
[411.64] I will not leave you, and
[417.28] oh what has she gone mad, what is happening, why do you guys want to leave me, she
[422.96] thinks of herself as a big courtesan, yes and you are not even a courtesan. We are a courtesan,
[427.80] wow, she is saying to the elder [ __ ] that she is a courtesan, you don't even feel ashamed, I don't feel ashamed,
[432.60] you feel ashamed, oh oh, to whom are you clapping, are you fighting like dogs
[438.80] and cats, you lesser devotees. Look, Amma is sitting in our room and taunting
[443.88] us, oh come on, I don't live for free, I give commission to your Amma, yes
[449.08] and she also breaks our strong ass, oh shut up, shut up, enough of
[454.40] this drama. You too, shut up, Sharif Jadi, I am a spit, I have come to your house and have been
[460.96] a fool, so you guys have made me work here in the evening and also
[465.60] eat at their expense, get out of here, give me a good commission for that song. The commission is gone, you leave it,
[472.04] not from here,
[478.08] you don't leave from today, go away, you keep quiet, mother, please keep quiet, they are girls, you are
[485.20] intelligent, no, aunty, no, now the matter is not going to end, Navasi. You tell me, when the customer
[492.92] comes, he comes in front of everyone, neither does he like it in front of everyone, nor if I like it.
[498.72] If he does, then what is my fault in it? Hey, if I had not known such men
[503.48] then I would have had bungalows and cars. Listen, this is what I don't
[508.44] understand. I am doing all this because of my sisters and brothers. If I had not
[515.64] had my sisters and brothers. Neither would I have sacrificed my life by jumping into a well, nor
[519.92] would I have kicked my honor, nor would this have been just
[526.48] to feed my sisters and brothers, and I would have stayed in their house for free and would have given them a full month
[534.20] 's commission. Aunty used to
[539.96] give food to everyone on a tray and she used to serve food to everyone on a tray and that wretched Champa
[546.28] keeps sleeping all day long. Now you tell me, am I cheating
[551.72] or are they cheating on me, okay leave it.
[555.76] Son, if there are only four utensils in a house then they definitely get dirty and
[562.92] small things happen everywhere. Small things are not small things. Aunty Champa
[569.56] has hit me by holding my hand. Leave me and don't worry. You do it, I
[576.52] will talk to Champa Amma, you know Champa, Champa's tongue
[582.72] is always on his shoulder, leave him, I will not go there, Aunty, I
[588.56] came to you so that you keep me here, which used to give commission there. I will give you
[593.36] the work that I used to do there, I will do it here and if not, then I will leave everything
[598.24] and go, I will give my life. Hey, haven't you gone mad?
[603.60] Why would you give your life? Yes, hey, and what do you think we are? We will keep you here as a maid,
[609.72] anyway, I
[613.00] do all the work in this house, so I will do it, it's just that you don't want to go there,
[618.44] it's okay, aunty Hema will now stay with us, okay Chanda, talk is not of use,
[627.72] work is. Wherever a man lives and does, it is a matter of favor, second favor is
[633.16] accepted, aunty, there is no return of a favor, a favor is just there, do
[640.92] n't end it now, Zeenat, I know Heera aunty will come here and that aunty will get her hands on me. Will you join me
[646.96] or fight with them if I stay here? Why does she insist on me?
[654.32] The matter is over, you don't go to her, no, you have to stay here, let
[659.76] the matter be over, come to my room [Music]
