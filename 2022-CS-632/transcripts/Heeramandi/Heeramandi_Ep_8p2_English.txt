[Music] You hate me so much that you left the house. I thought you cared about me a lot. You didn't care whether I ate food or not. You didn't even think that I would be tired when I came back. Who will give me coffee? I will make it up to whom will I talk, all this is not for me to do, that's why Shahram was saying, settle down your house, bring someone who will take care of you, don't make me take care of anyone, I will take care of myself, whatever you do with me. You have done a favor to me, I can never repay it, I have not done you any favor, I have expressed a wish, I have not forced you, I have never given you any trouble, When have I told you, you have given me trouble, but you have given me a lot of trouble. If you have taken care of me, I will never be able to forget this favor of yours, you have supported me at a time when I wanted to be supported for the whole life, you did not accept, however, you will not go anywhere from here, so I have to accept this Shahram. Why don't you accept that what you are thinking cannot happen, I have accepted that I have accepted that what I want cannot happen, but whenever I wanted something, it did not happen [Music] I have a request , I don't know whether I will agree with you I don't know what you are going to say, you are not for marriage [music] Kanga, but you can stay here, don't worry, I will leave from here, what are you talking about, you, I will stay here and you will leave from your house, I this I am not leaving my house and going to another house, I am going to UK and I don't know when I will return. At first I thought of not going but then I thought what will I do by staying here, it is better that I go. Look, if you are going because of me then I I am leaving not because of anyone but because of myself. What will I do by staying here? Who am I? Earlier I thought that you are [music] but you are not mine. You felt bad about me. Please forgive me. Go to aunty. Make them ready to stay with me [Music] I can't even leave you alone [Music] Yaar Lafde Yaar, come with me to the grave and pray for me, Yaar Allah I had heard you, but you didn't listen to me, my friend. I have prayed for you, my friend, I am a very sinful person. O friend, I had gone to do wonders and towards Ghazi Saheb. I have listened to him, but who listens to us, friend, but Ghazi Saheb listened to you but did not listen to me. Look, friend, not brother, take it. Go friend, take me, okay brother, I will take you but there is a condition, tell me or tell me, I mean, for a long time we have been drinking the pot of our money, this is not a good thing and I already knew that, that is why I I had brought it with me, I thought that when you promise, I will give you the pieces of my life, this is the ring, I love you [Music] [Music] [Music] O La La Ra Ra Ra [Music] [Music] Mother's Girl, have you gone mad? Yes, I have gone mad. It was my mouth, how did you take it? Yes, the poor people who come to the village leave it for me and the well-paid customers take it for themselves. You have become very smart, oh your father's customer . She liked me by suppressing you, you engaged her in conversation and took her away. Hey, you also had a client. What did you do? Hey, you kicked me away. I don't want such a client. You are very fast. You have girls worth Rs. 10,000. All the bangs are for me, I will not leave you, and oh what has she gone mad, what is happening, why do you guys want to leave me, she thinks of herself as a big courtesan, yes and you are not even a courtesan. We are a courtesan, wow, she is saying to the elder [ __ ] that she is a courtesan, you don't even feel ashamed, I don't feel ashamed, you feel ashamed, oh oh, to whom are you clapping, are you fighting like dogs and cats, you lesser devotees. Look, Amma is sitting in our room and taunting us, oh come on, I don't live for free, I give commission to your Amma, yes and she also breaks our strong ass, oh shut up, shut up, enough of this drama. You too, shut up, Sharif Jadi, I am a spit, I have come to your house and have been a fool, so you guys have made me work here in the evening and also eat at their expense, get out of here, give me a good commission for that song. The commission is gone, you leave it, not from here, you don't leave from today, go away, you keep quiet, mother, please keep quiet, they are girls, you are intelligent, no, aunty, no, now the matter is not going to end, Navasi. You tell me, when the customer comes, he comes in front of everyone, neither does he like it in front of everyone, nor if I like it. If he does, then what is my fault in it? Hey, if I had not known such men then I would have had bungalows and cars. Listen, this is what I don't understand. I am doing all this because of my sisters and brothers. If I had not had my sisters and brothers. Neither would I have sacrificed my life by jumping into a well, nor would I have kicked my honor, nor would this have been just to feed my sisters and brothers, and I would have stayed in their house for free and would have given them a full month 's commission. Aunty used to give food to everyone on a tray and she used to serve food to everyone on a tray and that wretched Champa keeps sleeping all day long. Now you tell me, am I cheating or are they cheating on me, okay leave it. Son, if there are only four utensils in a house then they definitely get dirty and small things happen everywhere. Small things are not small things. Aunty Champa has hit me by holding my hand. Leave me and don't worry. You do it, I will talk to Champa Amma, you know Champa, Champa's tongue is always on his shoulder, leave him, I will not go there, Aunty, I came to you so that you keep me here, which used to give commission there. I will give you the work that I used to do there, I will do it here and if not, then I will leave everything and go, I will give my life. Hey, haven't you gone mad? Why would you give your life? Yes, hey, and what do you think we are? We will keep you here as a maid, anyway, I do all the work in this house, so I will do it, it's just that you don't want to go there, it's okay, aunty Hema will now stay with us, okay Chanda, talk is not of use, work is. Wherever a man lives and does, it is a matter of favor, second favor is accepted, aunty, there is no return of a favor, a favor is just there, do n't end it now, Zeenat, I know Heera aunty will come here and that aunty will get her hands on me. Will you join me or fight with them if I stay here? Why does she insist on me? The matter is over, you don't go to her, no, you have to stay here, let the matter be over, come to my room [Music] [Music] Come on, you probably have forgotten everything, today is your birthday, I brought this cake and coffee [Music] [Music] Ho Aa [Music] [Music] [Music] Today is my birthday, don't do it for me [ Praise] [Music] Katu Candles [Music] Happy Birthday to you Happy Birthday to you Happy Birthday dear [Music] I saw you once in a saree [Music] I brought a saree for you [Music ] Thank you [Music] Hamara Guddu will be better Then what will he do for us?
