[ Singing ] [ Singing ] Zenu, oh Zenu, you are not ready yet. Mother, my full name is Zeenat Amaan. Yes, Zeenat Amaan, why are you not ready? Lafrah, must be bringing the customer, you are always late. Remember  When customers enter, their eyes should be immediately drawn to your dazzling beauty. All girls are outside already and you are still getting ready, Customer will move on. Why move on? I gave Rs.50 to Lafrah. What happened to you? You gave him the money even before he brought a customer. When he brings a customer, he immediately ask for his commission and than drink wadka. Hey Mother, he doesn't drink Wadka, he drinks local wine. He just says to show off that he drinks Wadka and mother, I am telling you one more thing clearly, there is no need to spend my money on your sister. Tell Chanda to earn her own money, get her mother treated, Okay, don't talk nonsense, she is not Chanda's mother, she is also my real sister, she has the right on my earnings. You earn yourself? Okay, there is no need to talk much nonsense, By the way,  a little make-up and you will look no less than Meena Kumari.  [ Singing ]   Hey Babra, no one has come yet. Someone will definitely come Hey, whom you are taking with you? You have not seen such a thing in your entire life, just see her once, Hey Lafray, I knew you were about to come. Sir, come this side. I will come after dropping him  Come on. Stop him, he seems to be rich. [Singing] [Singing] Chanda, you are not ready yet, I have to say it every day, get ready, Come on, get up. Atleast think about your mother. Zeenat has clearly said that she cannot earn for your mother and I too cannot force her. Hey Chanda, you can sing, you can dance. I also earn money by dancing. I, myself taking care of  of my mother, what are you taunting about? About her treatment. Now she cannot be treated in any charity hospital. Look Chanda, you know very well that you cost the most. If you want, your mother will be able to stand on the steps within a month, but if you don't want, then Get up, get ready, come out quickly. Hey, Phoolan ... What else is the matter, my king? Prepare paan very well and send up here. Send with Vodka. Just sending. Be quick Hey Vodka, I am preparing paan and giving it to you, go upstairs and give it to Lafra. I am not Lafrah's servant, tell him to come and take it himself, I am busy doing very important work, Every person here is very busy, playing havoc, busy as if he is doing government work. Get lost. Hey, Maqbool, come here, I will give you the paan. Go and give upstairs to Lafrah.  Ruined my shot. I had instructed you to go and get an injection from the doctor, but it appears that it hasnâ€™t been done. Hey Mother, the doctor is a fake and also gives fake vaccines. She even charges Rs. 50 for a vaccine. And listen, refuse Lafrah  Don't bring that moustaches one man     in the future. Hey, go and apply ice. Don't apply oil. I'll go and see her. Let Lafrah come.  [Music] [Music]  [ Music ]         [music] Aunt ... she doesn't even do the work herself, she doesn't even let anyone else do it, you sit down, sit down, sit down, I will bring you.

Phoolan, where did you disappear, What happen? A big mess has happened here. They took Chanda's mother  mother Dil Ara to the hospital, she has had a heart attack. Prostitutes don't have heart. how they can have a heart attack. Man, this is not a joke, go up and see Chanda is crying. The doctor had come, put her in his car and took. Are you telling the truth? What reward do I get by lying? Yes man, you don't get any reward by lying, okay you take care of the shop, I am coming in a short while. And don't touch the flowers. otherwise I will charge money from you. This is your shop not Sridevi whom I will touch. How unlucky I am and how unlucky you are. Neither do you know who your father is nor do I know who my father is. I wonder who would know who their father is How much pride must they have,  I wish, I could give you this pride. Mother, what pride looks like? I don't know. But in my youth, when I used to walk with my neck high, my mother used to say that this is the pride of youth. One day, When the end of life will come, this pride will fall at your feet. Hey Chanda Mother has come? Mother ... what happen to you? Mother, how will I live without you. [music] Despite being a Prostitute, She often taught others about goodness. It's good, she is dead I provided her with the best possible options, but she ended up spoiling Chanda. She has been lying in the dark for four days now, yes, I will decorate the bed, I will decorate the bed, I will decorate the bed, she don't know that one cannot decorate the bed before marriage. Now tell me one thing, will anyone marry her here?  it's good that she died, it's very good that she died, which bank balance has she left behind which Chanda can eats all her life Oh stop it my friend. For God's sake, Stop it now. You are high now. Otherwise all the night you will keep sitting here and abusing them . It is good she is  dead. Oh my friend, if Lafrah is not around, then this market will become silent. As without music and tabla we can't sleep, similarly, I can't sleep even without listening to his abuses, I don't abuse anyone My friend has spoken the truth. Listen to me, how long will this mourning continue? I don't know. Leave this all. Sing a song. Hey Vodka,  you finish the whole bottle. No dear, I just took one sip, still some remaining inside. Sing any song dear [ Singing ] [ Singing ] It's been so many days because of you, it's dark here. Dil Ara aunty has never kept brothel dark. Chanda,  We finish mourning in three days, if we do this then how will we fill our stomach. Get up, get ready, I don't feel like doing anything    Chanda Dil Ara was crazy. She used to see such dreams which she should not have seen, customers come in the dreams of a courtesan too Chanda and you are also a courtesan, you too have to live and die here Chanda. And here  the woman whose body has more wounds due to labor is richer, this is our fate, we cannot fill our stomach with just dancing, this is a very long life which has to be spent in this brothel, You should ensure only a few customers. Respectable people can give a lot of wealth, but not a handful of respect  But aunty, I don't like this work, I don't want to do it. What else will you do? Hey, you can't even handle washing utensils by going from house to house. Say to anyone for job. They will kick you out. Aunty, there must be someone who will marry me, take me away from here, Listen Chanda don't listen to the woman inside, the woman inside everyone is not a courtesan The woman inside everyone would die for sweet words of loyalty and love but she wants to remain with only one person, but this loyalty is not there in men, they leave their respectable wives and come to lick our soles, how will anyone marry you? Leave such things, otherwise you will dye of hunger, she is dead [music] Get up, get ready, Customers are about to arrive  [music]   [music]   [music] Whenever a good customer comes, go straight to Chanda's brothel.  Zeenat Aman is sitting here ... Chammak Challo and no one even pays attention to Chanda. Three customers have broken by Zeenat Aaman. Hey, why are you cursing Zeenat Aaman? The courtesan should throw tantrums like Zeenat Aman. You stand outside and come inside with a thud. Hey, go and learn some from neighbour's courtesan. Heera Bai, I have come for the last time. If your Hema created any trouble,  I will not come, I don't want to go to jail. If she does any such thing then I will strangle her and go to jail myself.
