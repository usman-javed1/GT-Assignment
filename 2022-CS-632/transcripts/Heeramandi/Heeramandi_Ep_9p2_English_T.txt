[122.52] was absolutely right, this must be the same bastard
[127.20] Police Station Officer, Heera Laffada was absolutely right,
[133.40] that scoundrel police station officer did this and if it is true that the SHO has kidnapped my Chanda,
[140.40] then
[143.68] my Chanda is gone, don't say such things. Just pray to Allah that our Chanda comes home
[153.40] and also pray that the police officer has not led her away.
[158.40] Heera, if Chanda is not found then I
[164.28] will comfort her on the day of doomsday and then how will her child grow up? Oh why does she worry? You
[172.44] do this, let's go to the shrine and pray.
[176.40] Yes, I will not return from there until we get donations.
[180.60] Oh no, we will go there and take a vow and if you remain sitting there, then
[187.48] who will see the child? And Husna. What will happen if you leave your hands and feet like this?

[722.44] you never told us, not only this many times. Was that you can love?
[729.56] Why am I not a human being? I don't have a heart. The human being who doesn't have parents,
[738.44] who doesn't have any name or mark, who sings to these women, doesn't
[746.04] have a heart. Can't I hate? Can I love
[750.60] or can I do everything [music]
[755.76] Be patient O take out some of your heart and take it away otherwise I will ask you

[784.24] I am done, kill me,
[792.60] my friend, make a fuss, make a fuss, when I am saying that I will drop you to home, then
[798.12] what is the problem Guru? No sir, why can't you go there?
[804.72] Yes, there is a huge excavation there. Yes, there are big pits, your car will get stuck. Yes,
[813.20] the streets are narrow. Don't you leave me here, I will help someone get a taxi. Yes,
[818.44] I will go here, here, here.
[822.84] Stop, thank you very much
[828.45] [music] Kindness and you have gone mad, this friend is giving me alcohol,
[837.64] if he doesn't drink then he will die, if he doesn't
[845.60] drink, he will go anyway If something
[850.84] has happened to Babu, then I have to commit suicide and the second thing is that when she
[856.48] was marrying Babu, she was not marrying Babu, she was doing it, that too I
[861.44] had said that if I had sex If something has happened to him, then stop it, my friend, stop it. Who is this light?
[868.64] He
[871.12] doesn't listen. Tell him that there is no dada. Today you will not get anything here and
[877.32] I swear to God, I will shoot you.
[884.44] O donation from here. Oh my, what happened to the small donations, I would have crossed it, I
[897.84] don't know who she was, she told you the truth, lied to you, who knows, who knows
[904.28] what her motive was, maybe she came with you to see the house on purpose, not so. No Shahram, it
[911.36] is not like that, you were running in the street, I followed her because you
[917.08] were feeling very helpless. Please do not get involved in these matters, in fact, you
[922.48] should not even study in such matters. You know, I am with you. I was so worried, okay
[927.84] don't worry, I
[932.28] will take precautions in the future, you are not understanding what I am saying, I will leave from here, you will be alone here,
[938.20] if something happens, what will you do,
[942.32] you are not afraid, you do not think anything, you are not afraid
[951.24] . Earlier I used to feel it, now I don't feel it anymore. When fear exceeds its limits, it ends.
[961.32] Fear never ends. A person becomes addicted to fear.
[968.20] The fear of your loneliness made you fearless, but remember one thing, someday or the other
[976.88] you will definitely feel this. It must be that you should not be alone.
[982.96] When is your flight
[987.92] on Saturday? You are trying to send me early,
[994.80] it was not meant to be
[999.72] mine. [Music]
[1004.36] I am always thinking of coming and getting you [Music]
[1009.04] Une Ok Oye, it was the same, it was the same. I understood and
[1015.36] who he was, I don't know all the policemen, not
[1020.12] all his brothers, I told you that he is the one who started it, but what will happen now, he
[1026.56] has become the police station officer of this area and you know what a scoundrel he
[1030.40] is, lol. I am telling you that she will trap all of us by making some fake case or the other. Okay,
[1036.52] she will do all this to you all because of me, I would take my child and
[1042.00] go somewhere from here, oh where will you go and I am
[1046.56] not afraid of her liar. We are good courtesans, but this
[1050.64] is our country too, there is no law for us, what else, at the most he
[1055.40] will lock us up and what else can he do, why is he so blind,
[1061.24] he did whatever he had to do. It's enough, Bibi, now whatever I do with him
[1066.56] will be seen by the whole world, whatever you do, Lafayya will not leave his dog-like status and I do not
[1071.92] want that because of me, Husna Aunty, Heera Aunty Champa Zeenat, any harm should come to anyone. Hey
[1078.24] Chinda, why are you? She worries, oh brother, we are all with you,
[1084.64] if we don't support each other, then who will support us? Who else do we have other than each other, oh
[1091.04] listen to my cheek, tomorrow you take it to Imtiaz Ali Khan yourself.
[1095.36] She will talk to him herself, otherwise he will call her himself and taut that dog.
[1102.00] Yes yes Lafda, why don't you do this, take Chanda.
[1109.00] Okay, then I will give the DSP, then he will give it to that SO and see, then
[1115.76] it is not a fake.
