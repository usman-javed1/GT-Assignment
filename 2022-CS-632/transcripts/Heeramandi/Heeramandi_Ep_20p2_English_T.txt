[26.00] Shumail
[32.00] She is sleeping. Where were you? I was in the drawing room.
[40.00] Why there?
[43.36] Come upstairs, let’s talk. Close the door.
[55.60] So, you...
[58.00] Were sleeping on the sofa all night?
[68.00] What was I supposed to do?
[71.00] I came, but your door was locked. You must have been asleep.
[75.00] No, no, Murad. I was not asleep. You should have knocked. I knocked.
[82.00] But I thought you were in a deep sleep.
[87.00] Then I went downstairs and slept.
[91.00] I'm sorry. I might have locked it absentmindedly.
[98.00] Murad.
[106.00] Actually,
[110.00] When you ....
[114.20] went in Zarka's room. Why did you bring juice?
[118.60] You know, I take tea in the morning. I am having a sore throat. 
[124.00]  I'll bring tea for you. You can drink juice.
No, I won't drink it.
[129.00] You took the helpers out. Who will take care of the house, breakfast, and water? 
[139.52] I'll make breakfast, don't worry. You know that It was necessary to let all servants go.
[144.64] I don't want them to...
[148.40]  find out about your and Zarka's relationship. You know what I mean.
[156.60]  You understand, right?
[163.08]  Murad, now...
[168.00] How is Zarka? I mean, you...
[172.00] I mean, you and her... Shumail
[186.00] Hello!
[189.20]  Walikum salam.
[194.00] I don't know. I mean, hold on.
[204.00] It's Zarka's sister on the phone. Take to Zarka.
[210.00] [Music]
[232.00] Zarka.
[247.00] Zarka.
[249.00] Hello. She is in the washroom. So, please hold.
[256.00] Yes, sister, you were saying something. It's your sister's phone.
[263.00]  She was calling on your mobile, it’s probably off. Yes, I turned it off.
[265.00] Yes, Pari, speak.
[268.00] Yes, I turned my phone off last night.
[273.00] I just didn’t feel like talking to anyone, that's why.
[278.00] Who?
[282.00] Yes, he is nice. Really nice.
[287.00] That's enough for me.
[291.00] Yes, and...
[297.00] You tell me, how is Mother?
[309.00] Look, Shumail, now it's not the time to think or understand.
[315.00]  I agree, it's not easy to tolerate other woman.
[317.01] But to gain something, you have to lose something.
[321.00] Now don't worry just be strong.
[326.00] I just can't be strong anymore. I've done enough of that.
[331.40] This is the first time I was alone in my bedroom like this.
[335.40] And this thought is driving me crazy—that Murad is with someone else in the other bedroom.
[340.40] I wanted to...
[342.20] make noise and break everything around me.
[346.20] I wanted to break down her room's door and pull him back.
[349.40] Don't even think like that, Shumail. Don't bring such thoughts in your mind, or you'll lose Murad.
[357.40] Seriously, right now you need a lot of strength, my dear.
[361.00] Don't let them know that you have any problems.
[364.40] Be very nice to both Zarka and Murad.
[368.40]  Otherwise, everything you've done will go to waste, and you won't achieve your goals despite all your hard work.
[375.40] Sheram is having breakfast.
[378.00] When he leave's for the office, I'll ask him to drop me at your place.
[382.40] Please come up!
[384.00] [Music]
[410.00] Shumail is getting worried.
[412.60] Yes, Sheram.
[414.00] She is worried
[417.20] I'm amazed on her strength. How can a woman share her husband with someone else?
[422.60] She did all this for the sake of the child, right?
[425.60]  Now she should be able to endure it.
[428.00] Or she shouldn't have done any of this.
[430.73] I told her the same thing—that fighting against fate is wrong.
[435.76] Sheram 
[437.79]  Please drop me at her house on your way to the office.
[440.21] Okay, I will drop you.
[443.00] [Song]
[449.00] Oh, wow You look like a hero!
[452.65]  It's good you came! Mother and I are going to Zarka's place.
[455.20] If you’re coming, let me know. No, I don't want
[458.16] I'm going out to have fun today.
[459.80] I'm going to places I've never been before.
[463.00] "And I'm going to eat at places I've never eaten from before."
[465.59] I'll eat to my heart's content. Come along with me!
[468.52]  I know you must have collected 50 thousand. That’s what's bouncing around in your pocket!
[474.13] I’ve never seen that much money before!
[477.20] And I don’t like saving money.
[479.32] If God is giving, then make use of it.
[482.20] If you save some money, it will come in handy for you.
[485.72] Okay, let me know if you are coming with us!
[487.28] I thought if you are coming, we can go together in your rickshaw.
[491.40] Okay!
[493.00] I understand everything. One minute, Auntie
[495.40] I know how selfish you are; that's why you're saying to go with me in my rickshaw for free.
[500.00] Hey! Don't be too cheeky. Just take the fare!
[503.28] No need for that; there are plenty of taxis and rickshaws in the market.
[507.16]  Hey, Auntie!
[509.16] I think you're still upset with me. I'm telling you, you're not being grateful.
[513.00] Look, don’t start again.
[514.93] My head is getting messed up. Just get out of here and go enjoy yourself.
[519.20] I'm going to have fun. I just came to ask how Zarka is.
[523.70]  Pari, you ask her on my behalf.
[525.40] She's happy in her home. I talked to her on the phone.
[529.40] I'll ask you all after a year. We’ll pray that she stays happy.
[536.20] He messed with my head. Now what are you doing? Hurry up!
[539.76] Mother, Pari, and Hema Auntie are going to Zarka's house. Can I go to?
[544.76] No, dear. There's no need for that. Mother, let me go.
[550.00] I don't think Chanda will go either. No one is going, just sit at home and relax.
[554.00]  
[555.40] Everything has gone to waste. If you do good, there's trouble; if you don't, there's still trouble.
[560.00] What happened? Neelam Auntie, Hema Auntie deposited half million. She went with me to the bank.
[565.40] And then she treated me like I am her biggest enemy.
[569.20] Anyway, forget about those people.
[570.20] It’s just a matter of two days; then things will get better on their own.
[573.00] Okay, I'm going out to have fun. Are you guys coming with me?
[576.32]  No, dear. I'm not of an age to go out and have fun.
[580.56] I'm going to Chanda. Rani has been insisting since morning to go, take her.
[586.72] I'm going to Chanda's. Thank you, Mother. You're great. I'll be back!
[594.80] Hey, where are you taking me?
[597.16] I'm taking you to the beach. We will eat gol gappas!
[600.12] I’ll take you to a big hotel and will eat there. Enjoy yourself with Whisky. Seriously!
[604.52] I swear on you.
[605.64] Okay, I'll get ready right now. You're already looking good!
[610.12] I'll go in these clothes. You're crazy! I am coming in a short while.
[616.56] [ Song ]
[622.92]  Chanda, what's the matter? You seem really worried since last night.
[629.00] You seem more upset than Hema on Zarka's wedding.
[633.52] You quietly left during the wedding ceremony too.
[636.16] And since you came, you've been worried.
[638.84] What's the matter?
[642.64] Neelum.
[645.40] Those wounds that hurt us years ago...
[649.80] with the time
[652.16] the pain lessens, and we feel as if all wounds have healed.
[660.28] Than small happiness reopens those wounds again.
[668.72] I have no sorrow over Zarka's wedding.
[672.84] Actually, I'm happy about it.
[674.88] That she didn’t marry Guddu.
[678.32] What would he have given her?
[683.12] At least she would be happy there for a year, right?
[686.88] Until the time came for divorce
[690.40] I just want that time never comes.
[693.04] In fact, I pray that God doesn’t give her child so soon.
[698.28] That she has to come back here after getting a divorce.
[701.60] What do you think? If there’s a delay in having a child, will they still keep her there?
[708.24]  God forbid. If they send her back even then...
[714.16] That's exactly what I'm praying for.
[716.00] That she doesn't have to come back here at all.
[718.64] Okay, Chanda. You didn’t tell me, which wound is reopen?
[725.04] Leave it, what will you do knowing that?
[729.56] I know you’ll never tell me.
[732.40] Come on, get up. Let’s have breakfast.
[735.44] Rani already had breakfast. I was waiting for you. Come on!
[752.28]  Hey, Chanda!
[753.80]  Chanda, I'm going to Zarka's house.
[757.56] Are you coming with me? How she will go? She is having fever since last night.
[764.08] Has she taken her medicine? Yes, I have taken the pill will feel better soon.
[769.68] Give my love to her.
[772.12] I'll definitely give, but you take care of yourself too.
[776.24] Okay, then I’m off!
[778.48]  Hema, I’m making tea, drink it then go. Oh, just forget it.
[781.88] It's already late, I needed to reach there quickly. Okay, Allah Hafiz!
[786.80] Alright, I'll make tea for you. Just sit back and relax.
[791.16] [Music]
[830.56] Yes, Zahid.
[834.88] I left home to go to the office, but I just don't feel like going.
[839.84] Don't worry, I'll come over, man.
[844.44] If I manage to control heart, then I will come, Alright!
[869.08] This is her third cup of tea since morning and hasn’t had breakfast yet.
[875.20] Why, Shumail? What happened?
[878.20] If I don't feel like it, then why should I force myself to eat?
[884.44] There are many things that a person may not feel like doing.
[888.48] But sometimes, you have to force yourself to do them.
[891.76] Then just refuse.
[894.28]  What are you saying, Shumail?
[896.04] Whatever has happened, it was for your happiness.
[901.36] I know.
[906.28] Where is Zarka? She didn’t come for breakfast.
[909.28] I sent breakfast to her room.
[912.00] Is it really necessary for her to sit with us here for breakfast?
[916.24]  I don’t want her to share everything with me.
[919.12] Or try to compare herself to me.
[922.48] What things won’t you share?
[925.00]  May I have breakfast here? I'm not used to eating alone, and...
[928.72]   I couldn't eat, so I thought I’d come here. I was asking about you. Come and Sit down!
[942.08] How are you?  
I'm fine.
[945.16] Sister, my mother and sister are coming today.
[948.40]  I was thinking of going home with them and then...
[951.72] he can come to pick me up in the evening.
[953.56] No, he won't come to pick you up from that area.
[956.40] [Music]
