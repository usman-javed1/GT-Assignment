[0.04] Hey, I have done the right thing, Mother, never see my face neither kissed me!
[5.05] That she is sad for me now. Talk slow. Someone will hear you.
[10.24] If they find out what you did, Hema auntie and Pari will definitely be angry. They will break your hands and legs.
[15.63] Hey, breaking hands and feet isn’t that easy! And even if they find out, what will happen then?
[22.56] Look, this is my personal matter. That guy slapped me.
[25.82] I didn’t wear the bangles; that I won’t take revenge from him.
[28.51] Tell me one thing: you arranged Zarka's marriage yourself, right?
[32.15] So why are you doing all this? That’s why they weren’t letting me meet her.
[36.16] So what wrong did they do? You were the one who married Zarka off to them.
[40.52] They bought Zarka. Once you sell something, you don't have any rights over it.
[46.40] Oh Come on.
[48.50] We didn't sell her forever. Whatever time period it is, you have no rights over her now.
[53.68] Accept this fact now. Besides, if you cared so much for her .... I made a mistake
[59.48] It was a mistake. I didn’t realize it then, but now I do.
[68.84] When she was sitting as a bride with Murad, right?
[72.56] It came to my heart that I should end this deal.
[77.76] That's why they say, that a person should think carefully before taking any step.
[83.72] Otherwise, time passes, and a person keeps regretting.
[90.80] I am going
[95.20]  
[104.05] It has become so messed up. I told you before. You didn’t listen.
[110.05] Alright, listen. Habib, I'm really worried.Why don't you do it like this that
[117.16] You go to their house and somehow convince them. Make sure they don’t file a report.
[124.88] If they file a report, he will get caught. And you know how much the police beat people up.
[133.71] Fall at their feet or do whatever it takes to convince them.
[136.30] Or I can also come with you. I’ll fall in their feet and convince them.
[142.40] You’ve gone mad, Chanda. Sit down and relax; we’re not going anywhere.
[148.20] But Habib .... If they filed a case...
[151.80] They would have arrested Guddu by now. Got it?
[156.00] And first of all, Zarka should have found out. She would have told Hema.
[161.00] Hema would have broken his legs.
[164.35] You're right. But you can at least do this, that you
[169.81] go to Zarka's house for some reason and find out what the situation is there.
[175.35] Hey, I don't want to know anything. I'm not going there.
[177.69] Didn’t you see how much Hema scolded Guddu? There was such a commotion last time.
[183.28] And then Zarka said no to both Hema and Pari.
[187.62] Chanda ... Chanda. 
[190.36] Hema is here, so don’t talk in front of her. I know.
[194.73] Hey, Chanda. You look so happy! Yes, I’m really happy.
[202.72]  Is everything alright with Zarka?
[205.16] Everything is fine now, and Zarka is very happy. Mashallah!
[210.59] Sit down.
[215.41] Lafray, Hey Lafray. Oh, there never seems to be any happiness in your life.
[220.78] At least bring some sweets. If you can’t bring sweets, then at least bring sweet pan!
[225.88] You're absolutely right.
[228.00] There is nothing in my life.
[232.62] Oh, that’s why I gave up all bad things in life.
[238.00] By the way, you did a really good thing by giving up alcohol.
[244.08] But I miss it a lot. Oh no!
[247.46] Who are you talking about? You're bringing up something that makes the heart ache.
[252.24]  Alright, go and bring some sweetness, please!
[256.83] Let me fix the machine, then I’ll go. Okay, forget it!
[262.28] So tell me, how is Zarka doing?
[264.83] She's doing very well. So well that I'll sleep soundly tonight!
[269.53] Oh, where are Neelum and Rani? Have they gone out somewhere?
[278.18] Chanda, now my only prayer to Allah is to find a good boy for Pari and get her married too.
[284.94] Then we will look at Lafrah, we will think something about Lafrah also.
[289.03] Hey, Hema, consider your age!
[293.76] Making jokes isn't good at this age. Got it?
[307.12] You are not going to the office? No, there was no such work in the office today so
[313.84] I thought that it will be done 
[321.74] Hello! Who?
[328.62] Walikum Salaam. Well yes
[336.37] Zarka, call for you.
[340.46] For me? Yes, why don’t you keep your phone with you? I forget
[344.64] Shoukd I keep the phone with me in the kitchen also? Okay, give me now.
[353.07] Hello, Pari! How are you?
[359.02] I’m doing well. I’m very happy! How about you and mother?

[399.62] [Music]
[420.54] [Music]
[437.15] [Music]

[477.40] Whisky Listen, see, you said that you
[482.32] brought it for me, so why are you hiding it?  I want to see this, give me
[488.08] Whisky .... Listen, 
[493.18] I can't give you like this!
[498.28]  Alright, fine. I don't need it now.
[500.49] How can you say you don’t want it? I brought it especially for you!
[504.00] Okay, fine. Give it to someone else; I don’t want it. Hey, listen don’t be upset with me.
[510.20] Here, take it. I brought it with great care.
[516.79] Such a small gift? You brought this with great care?
[521.64] Open it and see; it's very precious. I really brought it with my life in my hands!
[527.15] You brought it with your life in hands! I should also see what kind of precious gift you've brought.
[539.36] Whisky.
[544.20] Hold it once. I will kill you Whisky!
[549.80] I will give you a good one too, first you hold it. I will kill you.
[555.20] Look, it can run also.
[559.30] Whisky, I will not spare you! I’ve given such a nice gift; what more do you want?
[565.63] Oh no mosquito!
[571.44] Hey, silly, where are you wandering off to? Come on!
[576.40] Go inside and sleep. I’m not coming.
[580.00] I’ll come later. Hey, don’t go crazy! Get up and let’s go. I’m telling you to get up!
[585.34] You’ve gone mad! You’ll get sick. Come on, get up! Okay leave my hand. I’m coming.
[594.00] Your antics never seem to end! Always being so dramatic!  If I die, you will also die.
[600.36] Take care of your health, okay? Always lying around here!
[607.56] I’m tired of running after you. 
[630.60] Good evening!
[634.54] The weather is quite strange. It’s cold in the morning when you step out.
[641.57] In the afternoon, it gets hot. I swear I’ll get really sick!
[646.80] What happened to you, Shumail?
[651.84] Something should happen to me? No, I mean.
[660.08] Murad, I have made hot tea for you.
[663.40] Thank you! I've also made kebabs; you like them, right?
[667.28] Yes, you make shami kebabs very deliciously. Give me some!
[671.58] Here you go, enjoy!
[689.09] These are really delicious! They deserve an award. Seriously?
[701.83] For you!
[706.03] I brought for you too!
[718.40] I hope you like it.
[722.52] These are gold.
[731.19] I asked Zarka why you don't wear bangles?
[736.10] She said, glass bangles are sharp and give cuts!
[739.20] That's why I've brought same for both of you!
[751.49] You like them? They're very beautiful.
[758.67] Now please make some tea. Sure!
[783.03] Hey, Chanda, you’re again crying?
[787.52] And over there, Whiskey too.
[789.56] I felt really sorry for the poor guy.
[791.92] He came to meet you upstairs last night.
[794.47] And for a long time, he was watching you sleep outside your door.
[799.68] Don't you feel sorry for him? Please forgive him.
[804.68] A mother's heart isn't that hard. What can I do, Neelam?
[810.80] I'm his mother, but I'm embarrassed by his actions.
[816.61] Always misbehaving, always being naughty. What can I do instead of crying quietly?
[825.21] But Chanda Auntie, you always forgive him. Please forgive him again.
[831.48] It's been so many days with this anger. He can't even enjoy himself without you. 
[837.15] Chanda Auntie, just call him upstairs.
[843.24] No, Rani, If I forgive him this time as well
[847.34] Then he won't realize how much his actions hurt me. Just stop.
[854.82] The child has realized, so how much more punishment will you give him?
[861.84] I am getting punished for giving birth to him and raising him.
[869.60] Isn’t it my responsibility? I have to bear the consequences. Don't think like that.
[877.60] Everything will be fine. He loves you a lot.
[881.48] Forgive him. Embrace him; he’s your son.
[886.68] Hey, where have you been? Are you in Islamabad or 
[890.18] have you moved to America? What’s going on? You just vanished. It's been so long since we talked!
[896.80] Yes, oh no! A person shouldn't be so unfaithful; they should care about their friends.
[905.20] Murad says that your best friend didn’t even give her number and just disappeared.
[910.99] Murad is fine. He came from the office and  then went somewhere.
[916.36] Now he've just stepped in. He just came home. I’ll give your regards and greetings, whatever you say!
[922.65] yes, okay..
[926.88] Yes, we're waiting for that happy news!
[930.48] You know the situation well. So, how are the kids? Did you talk to them?
[937.73] That's very good! Now that you're here, we'll keep talking.
[944.07] Right? Okay, Salma, I’ll talk to you later.
[951.85] Okay, I’ll call you back. Allah Hafiz!
[981.64] You really enjoy making shami kebabs!
[984.32] Taste them!
[991.48] It's hot!
[994.88] It was too hot,
[1002.33] Shall I give you water? No, no, it’s okay. I burnt my tongue.
[1009.45] What Happened?
