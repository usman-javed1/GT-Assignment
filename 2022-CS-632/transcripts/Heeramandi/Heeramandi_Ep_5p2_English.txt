It's been two hours since Chanda left, she hasn't returned yet and I told you not to let her go alone. Ever since the day Lafda said with all her heart that I will take care of her child, I have lost all control over Lafda, oh her. I recognize the eyes, I count the feathers of a flying bird, and these men are not worthy of trust. I don't know what Amma thinks, sometimes you also talk nonsense. Which one will he take and run away? No, if it was there then it would not have been there and anyway our income is increasing, he will come, why do you burn your blood, why not burn my blood and you yourself had said that Chanda was saying that if it is a girl then she should sacrifice her life. Degi, don't you know, you are making a scene on some road, your dear mother, what kind of things are you talking, don't make any noise, something happens to Chanda, Husna aunty Husna aunty, the nurse says that you will have a son, Dev, we are very happy here to have daughters. Happiness is celebrated, Zeenat, do you know how many prayers I had prayed that the son is going to be the same, Inshallah, you showed me the bag, look at me, I have bought clothes and toys for the son, it is good to see, what is the matter, Husna Bhai, nothing happened to you and me. If there is nothing then be happy in Chanda's happiness, you are there to be happy and if you bring up the child too, then what is the need for me to be happy? Seeing Chanda, you have got the child yourself, I will not give it to you after earning more life, who is yours? What kind of income do you earn? We bring Zeenat and then you earn more. Lesna brother, oh come on, come on, she talks like this, is she jealous of you , isn't there any happiness in my life? If you don't write about your happiness then you yourself would have kicked me. Okay, come on, show me. [Music] Well, becoming a mother is such a big deal, but you don't mind, I will bring everything, and from where will you buy it? You will make our child wear all the old clothes from the market, I will bring new ones. Clothes for your child and what is your father's son, go away, get lost from here, we are leaving, that brother has started getting jealous, you are not me, look at her, look at me, my friend's sister is a very nice girl. She is doing MBA, her name is Anam, so what should I do, do you like me? Now I will talk, I don't want to marry further [music] You are still in love with that Chanda, I am not in love with anyone, just for now I am I don't want to get married, there is no program for me, so the marriage will happen immediately, we will talk now, then I will send you the relationship, then I will acquit you, I said no, I don't want to get married, I am going, okay listen, if you don't like it, I will see someone else. Why don't you get married? What's the matter? If I had to do it then why didn't I do it long ago and why can't I do it now? I will slap you. I know you wouldn't have found anyone willing to marry me. Yes, I haven't found anyone. Then why mention my marriage? Yes, you called my mother. No, I did not call. And please do not try to avoid this matter. Yes, you are talking so nonsense, call her. She has called twice. You have no issue with her, do you? Why are you not calling, this means that today we will talk only on the topic that why I did not call my mother, today we will talk on this topic, okay no problem, next time, but I will definitely talk to you on this topic. Yes Shahram, don't you feel ashamed of talking to me like this? What is there to be ashamed of? I am not proposing you, it is a reality. How long will you keep facing the problems of lonely life? You don't let people like me speak in between. Legally, someone will be your partner. At least he will be able to fight with others for you. You have become very ill-mannered. What is the rudeness in finding a boy for you? You also keep looking for girls for me all the time. Get up, get up, go to Ami. Call me at least uhe tose khon aaye yaar lafde, have I thought of the name of Chanda's son ? [Music] I have thought of hitting the head with stones, I am mad to run, I have named him yes, his name is Shahryar Ali Khan and where is Khan? The name has become 'Se', what is there in 'R', it is a very good name, it has great pride in it, Shahryar Ali Khan, friend of Lafad, friend of Whiskey, it is okay, no friend, thankfully if I had not kept it then the names of my wife's children would have been like this. Look at my name, your mother. You were not named Vard , then what was your name? Do you remember? No, I don't remember. But it was a very good name. What was its name? Oh brother, I remember its mother had named it Iqbal Bala Bala. She used to say o. Bala oh, is this also a name, my dear Bala Gujra ji Ba, it is better than that, it is Dak, my friend, it is such a good name, I get intoxicated after hearing it, isn't it ok sir, I kept it as my name. My remaining issue is that his name will be Shar Ali Khan. Why are you fighting? Ask his mother, she must have given him some name. Hey Amma, we see in dramas that when someone has a child, there is a baby shower. Flowers come, children's clothes are made, nothing like this happens in our country, why doesn't it happen, here we also have dances and songs, I remember very well when you were born, my mother was alive and my younger aunt was also alive. Fruits, flowers, sweets and lots of couplets for you, couplets for me, couplets for Babara and lots of toys. My younger aunt had brought gold anklets for you. Hi, what can I tell you? Amma had bathed you with milk and lots of colorful pictures. Amma Chanda is going to have a son, I am going to celebrate a lot, son, I am feeling happy, Amma is crying, mother is getting ready, oh yes, we will have to give, we will have to give, Puna has also done a lot of giving and heart. Begum was very nice, used in everyone's happiness and sorrow, Amma, then we should do it, oh yes, I will refuse, I am doing it for a while, now you guys go and prepare for the evening, I have gone to pick up the guys, I have broken my back. Now people also have to find and bring the name Shahriyar. I have thought why Shahriyar is Shahram's son or not, the name Shahriyar, which is similar to his name, will look good. Hey Chanda, you have not forgotten him yet, so I cannot forget him throughout my life, can you? You haven't forgotten him, how can you forget? So wife is right, but I am a woman, so you didn't fall in love with him, everyone has love, Chandana, it felt as if you had grabbed my heart with your fist, so I wanted to belong to someone else. No, but soon Amma's abuses took away all the intoxication. Seen, if you too had flown away like me, what would you have done? Fly Chanda, like your Shahram, he also ran away. For some time, I kept crying secretly and all the tears dried up, then I realized that All the feelings of the wife remain dry. I don't want ice to freeze inside me or my tears to dry up. I know that as soon as the child is born, Husna aunty will chase me and people will break down my door . Will you support me? Yes, Chanda, I will be with you. I will give you a promise. I used to think that I am all alone but today I found out that there is one and one is coming. Why are you crying? Keep quiet. I have heard that what a mother does and thinks has an impact on the child. Will you cry? So your child is also crying, get up and keep quiet, I will bring milk for you. Yes, and yes, I have also ordered coconut for you. Heera Bai says that if the mother drinks coconut water, the complexion of the child becomes fair. If you care about it, then the complexion is the same. He is fair, I have brought [Music] Nazar lagi raja tore bangla par nazar lagi raja tore bangla par I would have been king champa Chamelia smell would have been there Raja tore bangla par nazar lagi raja tore bang hi mother how are you Hey Babara Babara come quickly you 10 days She had said, " Where are you coming from after so many days? Hey, after so many days, you have come here. Have you come out? You are sweating in the heat. Why do you guys leave the door open? If you enter, we will not know. Hey, what are we left with?" You sit and come comfortably and everything is fine, the family members were fine. Hey friend, what can I tell you, you all know that I am the eldest among the brothers and sisters. I came here because of the job, I have been sending money to my mother to earn money, I thought of adding something. You must have kept nothing Sachi Champa, raising five children is not an easy task and that too of all the school going brothers, not even the youngest one will be there, what do you work here, they only know that I am a government employee here. I am true Champa, if your mother had not been there, I would not have been able to save so much money and take it away. Listen, you have spent so much money in six months. Oh yes friend, there was a lot of it, I was eating it while sitting, but this is the mind, didn't it come to my mind that I should have got my sister married, I would have come two months earlier, but then Amma became ill, I started serving Amma [music] Then Amma died, I felt very sorry Heema, but I am not sorry, I don't know why like this I used to be afraid that he might come to know what I do here. It is good that I died without knowing anything, it is cruel. Now who will raise your younger brothers and sisters? Hey, they are not even small enough that they have to be raised by the sister. No, the in-laws house of the one I married is in the same house, I have left everyone with him, hey, I have come here from there and you all are talking about the same place, tell me something from here, how are you, where is that aunty Heera? She is a market girl and let me tell you an interesting thing. Yes yes, Chachanda is going to have a child and that too a son. Well, Savitri used to be a very sati and the day before yesterday her lap was full. Okay, leave these things aside, tell me, did you take Chameli with you, where did you leave her, why didn't she come? She had gone with me, but she was with me. I had to go to Sahiwal, I thought she would have reached there, I thought you both ran away and opened a luxurious room far away, come on, stop talking nonsense, you keep talking nonsense all the time, you both are so wretched, I have been here for so long. You guys neither asked for water nor asked for anything to eat. How are you guys? I have forgotten that I had to listen to all the stories from you. Even now you would have brought sherbet. Listen, how are you? Your acting is going well. Just make me a heroine. Make me a heroine, oh oh oh, even if I get married, let it be, oh don't stop, I have been searching for you for so long and you are standing here, oh oh, looking at this, now I feel that he has become one-eyed, oh friend. Come on, it's time for business, it's already evening, we won't even be able to sing, O now there will be no business here, now no one will come here, no one will come here, why won't someone come here, there is going to be a raid here, oh stop joking friend, actually you people who sing You bring it, it doesn't just earn money, it also fills our stomach. Look, if we get the paan made, we will buy gajras, we will earn money, earning is your big earning, don't worry, if you do this for 25 gajras, you will spend 25 pounds. How much money will that be? I swear by Allah and you will give the money for it, I will give it from my bag. O I understand, I have got a very big person. Please change my mood. Oye, let's go, Chanda's baby shower is about to happen today. There is no customer today. Oye, you are telling the truth, you are paying for the flowers and paan. I am swearing on Allah from now on, I will give you food as well, but the flowers are from me and I will not even take money for the gajra. Okay. So then food is from you and drink is from me. Say hi hi hi hi my love, I love you a little, call me from now, what's the matter, is the bottle up or let's go, I will come in a minute. Ra aye din mein fun [Music] ] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Yes [Music] [Music] What happened to me
