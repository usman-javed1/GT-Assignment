[0.56] My child ...
[2.96] Allah has saved my child's life, Oh Allah, thank you!
[12.40] Mother, why are you crying now? I am fine.
[19.84] These are tears of thanks, just get well soon,
[27.12] come home with me, the house is deserted without you. No Mother,
[33.44] do you know what Murad said? He said
[40.64] that I and my child will live with him, he is not divorcing me mother.
[48.60] Mother, have you seen the child? How is he, whom he resembles? I forgot to 
[56.56] ask Murad. He resembles Murad?
[61.86] He resembles both of you. Mother, you know
[70.76] Murad had told me that I should name the child,
[76.16] I will name him Faraz, Faraz is a good name, isn't it?
[83.22] You are feeling fine my child?
[90.08] You just come with me. No mother, I will not
[99.00] go home now, I am very happy with Murad. Yes, my child,
[105.44] Allah has fulfilled my wish that he is not divorcing you.
[113.04] I will pay my gratitude after going home. Mother, where is Pari?
[118.84] and Chanda Aunty hasn't she come? She is coming. Chanda Aunty
[127.36] is not well and Pari has gone downstairs, she is coming.
[133.84] Mother, don't let Whiskey come here, he
[140.48] will create a drama, he will harass them.
[147.80] Don't worry, he won't come here. Guddu, what
[155.44] happened? You have gone mad? You yourself will also die and get us die too. 
[160.92] You will be beaten by sir, one problem is over,
[167.24] you have started another one. Children are not born simple,
[172.24] children are also born through operation. I have apologized to you, yet you are 
[178.20] scolding me. I am saying this because don't speak in front of your mother,
[182.68] otherwise .... I won't do anything and listen, there
[188.56] is no need to tell mother what happened in the hospital, she will say lovingly once, Habib, what
[193.36] happened? and you will tell everything so take care of it
[197.08] I will not tell, come inside. You go, I will come after smoking a cigarette, otherwise she will hit me for this too.
[205.48] You are just rotting your lungs, come quick. 
[219.76] Hey Chande, Hey Chande
[226.16] What happened? Why are you making so much noise?
[232.20] Did you call the hospital, what happened there? I called the hospital; I think baby is born
[239.36] if it had been bad news then they would have called me. Don't talk rubbish.
[252.76] By the way Habib, I am very scared,
[259.08] after the child is born, Zarka will leave her child there?
[267.72] The heart is shaken that how can a mother be separated from her child,
[274.72] She had gone to get money, she will return with the money, end of story.
[282.48] Rest is her destiny, by the way Guddu is right
[286.84] he says this rich people strength their relations with the courtesan, but 
[293.40] to break. Hey Lafray, it's too late, call them and ask. Okay, dial number
[300.64] call Pari.
[308.64] Take this.
[310.48] Hello Pari, how are you? It's me Lafrah.
[319.04] The operation is done.
[324.92] Congratulations, congratulations, thank God. What?
[331.68] What happened?
[334.32] Oh God! Okay, I'll do something.
[338.56] Tell me what happened?
[343.84] Very bad news, the child is dead. Hey, child is dead?
[351.88] Amazing news! Shut up, you bastard. What is the point of keeping quiet, this is a matter of happiness,
[359.68] I am going to take Zarka. You will not go anywhere, sit down otherwise... Otherwise what? 
[365.92] What can anyone do to me? Someone else will do or not, first I will cut both of your legs.
[371.72] She herself will come.She won't come on her own, I will bring her. Guddu,
[378.80] no one will be worse than me if you go there. Okay, I am not going, but
[384.92] I am telling you; I will not stay for long. Don't threat me, go from here. He doesn't know how to talk to elders.
[393.32] Habib, that's why I say don't take him there,
[398.16] He neither celebrate our happiness nor sorrow,
[403.28] I don't know what the condition of Hema and Zarka will be there. Zarka must have gone crazy crying.
[413.36] By the way, we should go there. Let's go.
[424.12] No, I will not go there, he will be there too. Let him be, what he can do?
[432.64] Leave it, now Zarka will come back here, I will give my condolences here.
[440.12] By the way, you should go. Who will be there to take care of Hema and Pari? Okay, okay,
[446.88] I will go. By the way, meeting time is over.
[453.76] The watchman closes the doors. I will call and ask for something. I do something. 
[459.72] He took the phone, he forgot me.
[465.32] He is dead, now what is Murad doing there? Tell him to handover Zarqa
[471.48] to her family members and come back home. There is no humanity in you. I am
[477.56] surprised to see your attitude. You are surprised at my attitude?
[481.68] What do you think about Murad's attitude? He
[485.80] did not even look at me once in the hospital, did not talk to me. He spent the whole time near the door of the operation theater.
[489.72] She was dying. She is saved now, but our child is dead for whom
[496.04] we have suffered so much. Because of you, don't make me open my mouth, if that child is dead, then it is
[501.88] because of you, if Zarka has reached this situation, then it is because of you and let me tell
[507.72] you something, Murad will drop Zarka back but you
[513.80] have created a lot of distance between you and Murad, write this down. Don't worry about the distance at all,
[518.44] leave it to me, I know how to reduce. I know he love
[524.20] me and he can't stay away from me for long. You don't have the slightest sympathy 
[529.24] for the person whose love you are so proud of. You don't even know how much humanity is there in him.
[535.56] Please leave this topic. Please call Murad. Tell him that she must have had leave today,
[540.84] so throw Zarka at her house and come back to his house
[546.10] [music]
[549.40] What are you saying all this, are you hiding something from me?
[555.40] Tell me what you are hiding from me? Murad tell me, what has happened?
[567.64] Our child is no more in this world,
[575.72] our child is no more in this world,
[581.44] Zarka ... Zarka
[588.00] I agree Shumail did bad with you, I apologize to you for that,
[595.60] but see ...
[601.40] what was not in our destiny, how could we stop it?
[606.16] Zarka ...
[612.76] The boy was already dead, that's why operation had to be done
[627.92] No .... Murad ....
[634.44] But I didn't even see his face 
[646.08] Why didn't you tell me? I should have see him.
[653.12] I was helpless, the doctors had forbidden, you were in such a condition What could I do?
[659.96] No ....
[663.80] My baby ....

[691.08] [Song]
[701.72] Why are you so happy, my son? What have is the reason, where are you taking it?
[707.92] Your wedding time is over, now think whose wedding procession will go?
[712.72] I will bring my bride in it. Curse on you! You have been cursing them all your life, remove this ditch
[719.96] from your mind, don't go to her. whether she will come, or they will leave her, that's fine,
[726.24] That's what I am waiting for, otherwise I would have gone to the hospital and bring her
[730.40] and listen to one thing, Lafray, I have agreed with you and mother only because she will come
[735.44] then you will not create trouble. Who is there to go in my wedding procession,
[740.36] except you and mother. Hey, move back, my heart says she will not come. Your heart is
[746.76] lying. Who is calling. Hey, it's that Madam.
[753.36] Hello, Yes madam. Has Zarka reached there? No madam
[760.80] She has not come here, we are also waiting for her. Then go to the hospital
[765.32] immediately and take her. But Madam,  Murad Sir had said that
[769.72] he will call me. What am I telling you, go to the hospital and take Zarka from there immediately,
[774.68] Okay madam, I am going right now. Did you hear it Lafray
[780.00] I used to say, she will live in that house, the work is over, the child is dead,
[784.64] why would they keep her? Go and ask Hema aunty, who else will go to my marriage procession? 
[790.48] Stay away! Go and ask yourself!
[793.48] [Song]
[817.20] I think Murad will leave Zarka at her home. Obviously Shumail already could
[824.24] not tolerate her, why would she do now? By the way, if you ask me, I sympathize with Zarka more than Shumail. 
[835.36] I have made a big mistake. I am very ashamed of myself.
[842.00] When I told you that you were doing wrong, at that time you felt bad.
[848.60] Shehram, I want to tell you something. Go ahead!
[859.36] I never thought like this, but ever since Murad and Zarka got married, this
[866.12] thought keeps coming to my mind that children are very important.
[871.92] What do you want to say?
[876.40] I am the reason for you not having children
[882.25] So?
[885.28] If you want to do second marriage, then I give you permission.
[892.20] Now at this age, getting married for the second time will suit me?
[896.88] It's a matter of race, it's a matter of having a name. You leave these things and
[906.32] tell me that Murad have reached home?
[912.00] Yes, maybe. I don't know. I just wanted to ask whether he has left Zarka or not?

[1020.84] Zarka, I have come to take you, come quickly.
[1025.92] Say Something ...
[1031.76] Zarka?
[1040.72] Where has she gone?
[1050.40] There was a patient in that room, where has she gone? She has gone
