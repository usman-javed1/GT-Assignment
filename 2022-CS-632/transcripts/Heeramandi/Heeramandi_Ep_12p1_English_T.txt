[707.12] Will have a nice house for us. You want paan? In the joy of marriage,
[716.08] you bring paan? Instead of sweets, you will bring Paan? If she want sweets, I will bring sweets for her.

[739.04] I will take care of her. You go.
[744.68] I will bring right now. He will marry me and settle down.
[753.00] By the way Zeenat, Why don't you marry him? You have also gone crazy, I will
[760.00] marry him? Crazy !!
[774.72] Take this, drink some milk and
[781.04] take medicine, Mother, I have been taking it since morning, it didn't
[786.80] make any difference. There will be only a little difference in one day,
[791.68] the doctor was saying, you have to take medicine for a week, next week when we go,
[799.48] it will make a lot of difference.
[802.44] I have brought sweets. Don't you feel ashamed, Zeenat
[808.84] is lying ill and you are celebrating and bringing sweets?
[812.48]  Zeenat had told me to bring sweets. 
[818.64] Mother, he has brought sweets to celebrate our marriage. Somehow sweets have come to this house,
[826.12] he think that I will really marry him, Crazy
[846.60] he is crazy. I will eat sweets,
[852.68]  eat sweets also but first drink some milk.
[857.16] [ Singing ]
[866.64] [ Singing ]
[886.72]  
[892.56] Clap for me, I sang so well, I sang so well,
[898.72] Let's do again.
[913.04] [ Singing ]
[919.36] What's going on? Walikum Asalam. What you were doing Sheryar? What is this all? Musical Anklets?
[930.64] Check his copies, see this. Check his books,
[936.92] Pictures of dancers on every copy, I do not understand what
[941.84] kind of environment your child lives in. He was caught dancing in the class many times. Have you ever
[947.64] seen it yourself dancing? It dances exactly like a prostitute. He has
[953.64] made the whole environment dirty. The child learns a lot
[959.84] from the environment of his home and his locality. You first improve his environment and then send him school.
[966.32] This is a school, not a gimmick. Your child doesn't want to study
[972.36] doesn't concentrate on studies at all. There are other children in the school who also study, they also do their school work
[977.40] regularly. Many times have I written on the copy that I
[981.84] want to meet you but you did not come. He never
[987.28] showed me that copy, I did not even know that you wanted to meet. 
[991.52] More playing he dance, what are you teaching him? He brings musical anklets in School.
[997.68] shows dance to the children in the class. When I asked him what he is doing, he said, '
[1001.60] This is our business and on top of that, he says his name is not Sheryar, it's Whiskey. Just
[1007.68] think and pay close attention if this child will do this, what effect
[1012.76] will it have on other children? If the parents of other children come to us and ask what kind of children you
[1018.24] are teaching our children, then what answer will we give them? Sorry, today we
[1025.36] have removed your child's name from our school.
