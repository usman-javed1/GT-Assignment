I have lost my mind, my legs are becoming weak while walking. I swear to God, You want tea? Yes, give me. Hey, why don't you go to shrine and look, last time also we found him at the shrine. I was sitting at the shrine I have been searching for him for eight days, he has been missing for eight days and Phoolan also closed his shop in the evening and went away. Hey Phoolan had opened the shop but was sitting idle, he didn't even make gajras. A man came and was asking about a Vodka. Phoolan went with him. How did you know? I was with him.  Someone might have come to ask, stop worrying about Vodka,  worry about yourself, Vodka will come after sometime. He has us only in the entire world For whom it has come?

[Music]  He drowned in sea [Music]  [Music] [Music] Hey Chanda, for how long will you survive by sewing? Hey, now your son has become young, he is running Rikhshaw, why don't you take his earnings, He earns illegal. I will not take from him, my livelihood is done, what do you think, I don't know, even today he brings customers for courtesan in his Rickshaw  look at the life styles of the courtesan, they live in big bungalows,  he has relations with them, He bring customers for your daughters too. Chanda, don't talk nonsense to me, my girls don't do illegal business dancing or singing, they have to do for living.   I had made a big mistake by not going back home. I said to you to go back I wish I had gone, my girls would not have been here. Whatever happened is in front of you, till date I have not seen my siblings I think not even one of them has thought that the sister who earned for us, where she has gone? They had searched for me, you look for me around. Forget it, this world is selfish, and this creates courtesan. You are right, Chanda. I came to you for a work. Talk to Whiskey, he should marry Zarka. At Least I will be free from one girl's responsibility. What do you think? I have not explained it to him,  I have told him a thousand times, he doesn't even listen to me.  He ignore this topic. Now we can't force him. If anyone tries to force me, then see, I am telling you, Lafrah, I will not marry Zarka,  tell my mother. Either she doesn't meet me, if she meet, then it's only one thing, get married. Say to mother break this engagement, even Zarka also smiles after seeing me, I don't like this. Hey, your engagement was fixed by Zeenat. She herself died, and put this noose around my neck. You also used to say that I will marry Zarka. I was so small that time at least you all should think once. She is a very nice girl,  Guddu, you will not get any doctor in your life, marry her. I don't know Lafray, My heart does not want. Hey, What kind of trouble is with Aslam. You went to him? He was not there. Hello, yes, there was no credit in my phone, tell me. Okay, I will bring the girl. Hey, tell your master, if he sees her dancing, he will keep watching. I swear, then she will add more colour to your party. She dances in such a way that everyone starts dancing. Talk to your boss. If he didn't like than I will return the money Hey, people die to see her dancing. Yes, I swear.  Look Chanda, look what I have brought for you. Hey Chanda,   What has happened, why are you making so much noise?  Look what I have brought for you to eat. Come let's eat food,  where did you bring it from? Oh God, I swear it is not by illegal work, come eat. Guddu had given you the money? No   I have brought it from my own. Nowadays, with your blessings, the shop is running very well. Oh come on, hurry up, bring the plate, listen to me, see, somehow I have spend my life, yours has also passed, you don't feel the pain sometimes? It's over now, no use of talking about it. Senseless people also live, I also lived. Shall I ask you one thing Chanda? My life is ruined because of loneliness. You are not afraid of loneliness? sometimes person's past life becomes the support of living this is my support too You have not forgotten him, right?  Come on, bring food. Let's eat food, come on, eat food, come  I don't know whether Guddu has eaten or not. He will eat He is going to the function with Pari and Zarka, he will manage. He will eat there. Bring quick and bring water too. Mother, I am was very tired. I swear, there were very stingy people. They paid only 2000. Tell Whiskey to settle the money in advance and only then I will go. That's why I don't work so hard. Hey, what is the benefit of killing your life, mother now you also leave Ustad ji. We get hardly two to four thousand rupees, out of that, he takes 2000 for himself, 1000 to 1500 paid to Tabla master. Tell her leave classical and learn disco dance. Nowadays, it is the era of disco dance. Why do you get what you get by going to these disco parties? Last time I brought only 5000. Mother, tell her. These disco parties are organized by very big rich people. They spend day and night playing with money. Pari is right. Nowadays, it is the era of senseless dance. All these people like this. Hey mother, you are calling disco dance senseless. Wait. I am playing a song and show you a nice item. What's the problem, Pari, have you come after listening to so much noise? Are you not tired yet?  Hey, why am I getting tired? You have danced there,  you always keep ordering me. Now I I will not share room with you, Don't share Mother, now I will not stay in the room with her, She does not let me do anything, neither listen to songs, nor does she let me read the magazine. If I play song, she says turn it off. I am having headache. When I read, she says turn off the light, I want to sleep. Why do you keep reading these novels all the time? I just told you, pick up your things and go to her room, give me your room, at least I I will be able to decorate it as per my wish, I will put up these big posters, I feel like I have to do this only. I feel relieved. Hey Lafrah, I talked to my mother? Why is she angry with me? Even today, I keep knocking at the door? She did not open it. She is angry with you. Why? What have I done? I gave you the money, she returned it, then you sent the same money with Hema Auntie, she did not take it. What she want? Guddu, she came to know that you are sending customers to Hyderabad and bring girls from Hyderabad and you know that she doesn't like this work. Why don't you listen to us? Zarka and Pari are dancing for you, you get a good commission, I have given you a new Rickshaw. Why are you not earning legal money? That's what I do I send all legal money to mother. what is the matter, why doesn't she listen? What should I do?  Tell me one thing, how is my mother? She is not well, Guddu. I meet her, she seems  down, like dry flower. She is a very nice woman and a very good woman, she has lived in this locality with great respect, I swear to God, since childhood, she wanted to take you away from here, but it was not in her hand.  Guddu she doesn't like this work, she wanted you to be a big man, people respect you. Oh friend, Stop this. Since childhood, I have been listening this speech every day. What Respect? let me tell you one thing, I have good respect, at least here. Someone calls for a girl, I clearly refuse, I say that we do not do illegal work  Singing and dancing is art. Tell me one thing, sometimes, I think I should establish a relationship with a TV person once Zarka gets the work. Hema Auntie says that we will leave all this and go somewhere far away and I will also take mother to her. You sit here for a minute, I am coming. Listen to me Guddu, don't go to your mother, she will get angry.
