Just pray to Allah that our Chanda comes home and also pray that the police officer has not led her away. Heera, if Chanda is not found then I will comfort her on the day of doomsday and then how will her child grow up? Oh why does she worry? You do this, let's go to the shrine and pray. Yes, I will not return from there until we get donations. Oh no, we will go there and take a vow and if you remain sitting there, then who will see the child? And Husna.

Bravo [Music] Yaar Phal, my world has come to an end, my world has come to an end, man, I used to live after seeing Chanda, oh man, you used to love Chanda so much, oh man, you never told us, not only this many times. Was that you can love? Why am I not a human being? I don't have a heart. The human being who doesn't have parents, who doesn't have any name or mark, who sings to these women, doesn't have a heart. Can't I hate? Can I love or can I do everything [music] Be patient O take out some of your heart and take it away otherwise I will ask you to be patient Be patient and see if he says it right and see what can we do apart from singing Tane Nayat Ali I have talked to Khan, right? We will have to wait, how much should I wait, what should I cross [Music] I am done, kill me, my friend, make a fuss, make a fuss, when I am saying that I will drop you to home, then what is the problem Guru? No sir, why can't you go there? Yes, there is a huge excavation there. Yes, there are big pits, your car will get stuck. Yes, the streets are narrow. Don't you leave me here, I will help someone get a taxi. Yes, I will go here, here, here. Stop, thank you very much [music] Kindness and you have gone mad, this friend is giving me alcohol, if he doesn't drink then he will die, if he doesn't drink, he will go anyway If something has happened to Babu, then I have to commit suicide and the second thing is that when she was marrying Babu, she was not marrying Babu, she was doing it, that too I had said that if I had sex If something has happened to him, then stop it, my friend, stop it. Who is this light? He doesn't listen. Tell him that there is no dada. Today you will not get anything here and I swear to God, I will shoot you. O donation from here. Oh my, what happened to the small donations, I would have crossed it, I don't know who she was, she told you the truth, lied to you, who knows, who knows what her motive was, maybe she came with you to see the house on purpose, not so. No Shahram, it is not like that, you were running in the street, I followed her because you were feeling very helpless. Please do not get involved in these matters, in fact, you should not even study in such matters. You know, I am with you. I was so worried, okay don't worry, I will take precautions in the future, you are not understanding what I am saying, I will leave from here, you will be alone here, if something happens, what will you do, you are not afraid, you do not think anything, you are not afraid . Earlier I used to feel it, now I don't feel it anymore. When fear exceeds its limits, it ends. Fear never ends. A person becomes addicted to fear. The fear of your loneliness made you fearless, but remember one thing, someday or the other you will definitely feel this. It must be that you should not be alone. When is your flight on Saturday? You are trying to send me early, it was not meant to be mine. [Music] I am always thinking of coming and getting you [Music] Une Ok Oye, it was the same, it was the same. I understood and who he was, I don't know all the policemen, not all his brothers, I told you that he is the one who started it, but what will happen now, he has become the police station officer of this area and you know what a scoundrel he is, lol. I am telling you that she will trap all of us by making some fake case or the other. Okay, she will do all this to you all because of me, I would take my child and go somewhere from here, oh where will you go and I am not afraid of her liar. We are good courtesans, but this is our country too, there is no law for us, what else, at the most he will lock us up and what else can he do, why is he so blind, he did whatever he had to do. It's enough, Bibi, now whatever I do with him will be seen by the whole world, whatever you do, Lafayya will not leave his dog-like status and I do not want that because of me, Husna Aunty, Heera Aunty Champa Zeenat, any harm should come to anyone. Hey Chinda, why are you? She worries, oh brother, we are all with you, if we don't support each other, then who will support us? Who else do we have other than each other, oh listen to my cheek, tomorrow you take it to Imtiaz Ali Khan yourself. She will talk to him herself, otherwise he will call her himself and taut that dog. Yes yes Lafda, why don't you do this, take Chanda. Okay, then I will give the DSP, then he will give it to that SO and see, then it is not a fake.
