[0.16] No, I have very good fortune, you know, whatever I
[5.13] asked from God, I have got it.
[10.59] Tell me one thing Rani, how long does it take for a child to be born?
[19.86] What does it mean? How long it takes a child to be born?
[23.78] You don't know? Don't act like a child. I know!
[30.28] Can't it happen quickly? What's wrong with you? What are you talking about?
[38.82] Where are you going? I am coming in a short while.
[46.13] How much time a child born? Stupid!
[53.15] He is that woman's husband? Yes!
[58.36] I'm thinking, why I went. I should not go there.
[64.53] Neelum, today there was no distance between him and me.
[69.32] He didn't say anything? I didn't hear anything, even though he was saying, 'Answer my question.
[78.60] I don't know what he would have asked. I was in such a bad state, that's why I ran away from there.
[86.11] Thank goodness his wife came from behind. He got startled and I slipped out from the back.
[93.00] But Chanda should tell him that Whisky is his son.
[97.87] How can I tell him? And what should I say, that I couldn't raise his child?
[103.59] I couldn't provide proper upbringing. 
[108.00] Yes, you should tell him. Even the respectable man would find out about a night spent with a courtesan.
[114.42] It puts his dignity at stake. Don't they think that they could also have children?
[120.78] Those who grow up to become either a courtesan or a pimp.
[126.88] I can't say, and I don't want to say.
[147.24] [Music] 
[155.53] You have fallen asleep.
[163.63] What you are understanding can't be true. Can I do something like that?
[173.87] Yes, this tension sometimes risen up within me.
[178.83] That night with Chanda—wasn't the biggest mistake of my life?
[190.28] A person's sins are remembered much more than his good deeds.
[198.93] This is not called a love; it's called regret!
[209.29] The truth is this Zaira,
[211.88] After seeing her, my doubt turned into belief. 
[218.48] Indeed, my sin has been proven to be excessive. 
[236.10]  You are listening to me?
[244.99] [music]
[263.64] We have thought about the child's name. If it's a boy or if it's a girl, what name will we give.
[274.04] We?
[278.84] But you didn't even ask me. Can't I name the child?
[286.31] You can name it, why can't you? If you have a good name in mind, just let me know and we will final it.
[294.30] Zarka, Oh, haven't you finished your juice yet?
[299.30] Murad, tell her to finish the juice.
[303.46] Yes. Drink the juice, it's good for you.
[306.95] After this, we have to go to the hospital to meet the doctor. 
[310.15] We need to register your name at the hospital. After that, we will go to the market and buy a lot of clothes for the child.
[315.27] Okay. I will prepare breakfast. Did you call that doctor?
[320.90] I was about to do that. I forgot, I am sorry, I'm doing it now. I will prepare breakfast.
[330.76] Look Chanda, I have bought whiskey, he is standing outside, now you end this conversation.
[338.62] See, if everyone treats him with such hatred, his mind will keep spinning like a madman.
[346.50]  Oh, forget it. Listen to me.
[351.22] Look, he is your child too. He also have the right to love you.
[357.14] And I only know one thing: if you scold children to get them to agree, they will never listen.
[363.42] If you talk to him nicely, he will agree.
[368.87] Look, Chanda, you have only one son. He spends all his time hanging out outside.
[376.75] It has been a long time since he has been sleeping in Lafrah's room. Please forgive him.
[382.12] Look, that poor person has nothing else in this world except a mother's love.
[386.35]  What do you all think? I don't love him.
[392.25] What should I do? When he comes to me, he ignites my heart.
[397.68] Leave it Chanda, he is not the one who burns your heart, the one who did have long gone time ago.
[405.95] And you are taking out his anger on him. Look, Chanda.
[413.17] If his father left him, what is his fault in that?
[418.29] Even if he has become like this, it's not Whisky's fault, right?
[422.84] You yourself say that the Vodka and lafrah have made him like this. Please forgive him!
[433.11]  Okay, listen to me. I am calling him inside, now you
[438.16] You talk to him lovingly. Shall I call him?
[447.52]  Whiskey, hey whiskey come inside 
[452.36] Come now. Do you like
[461.08] to make mother angry every day, you don't know Heaven lies at mother's feet, come apologize
[467.24] Come on, let's go apologize. Chanda, forgive him.
[482.56] Do you think Guddu, I don't love you?
[489.41] You're crazy; who else do I have besides you?
[497.68] I just want you to be with me all the time, but when you come, you make me angry and boil my blood.
[505.86] Where should I go? What should I do? Okay, Mom, I won't do anything now.
[514.16] Mom, please forgive me.
[521.16] I am very sad; I had thought that when you grow up.
[527.46] I will marry you and live peacefully.
[534.15] My home will flourish.
[538.84] Now I think that when I marry you, we will leave this neighborhood and rent a bungalow somewhere.
[549.04] Hema and Pari also want the same.
[552.00] We will all live together. Mom, I also want us to move somewhere else, and then I can get married.
[565.73] Mom, when Zarka has a baby...
[569.76] ...and she comes back here, then please get me married to Zarka.
[575.03] [Music]
[594.46] I'm putting up pictures of Murad here for Zarka because I want...
[600.08] You should see Murad everywhere, because I want my child to be just like him. Right, Murad?
[614.09] Whose child? Our child! Mine and Murad's, right?
[625.35] Yes, the child will be mine and yours, right? Yes, mine and yours!
[647.28] Mom has lost her mind. You tell me, is there any connection between you and me?
[653.28] You know that I love Zarka, and Zarka loves me. You know everything.
[661.48] And when I told you that Zarka loves you, she's your fiancée.
[668.76] You clearly rejected the idea of marriage.
[672.81] And you also said that you don't love Zarka.
[680.50] You've forgotten everything, Whisky. No, I haven't forgotten anything, Rani.
[688.79] I just didn’t realize that I would feel this way once she left.
[698.64] Leave this, you have never loved anyone,
[705.37] That's why you don't know how love feels or when it hits you. You can't understand this feeling.
[721.08] I know, Whisky.
[724.85] What love is and how it happens.
[732.58] You also love someone?
[741.27] Let it go. No matter the situation, Rani, whatever happens...
[746.94] Tell Mom that if I get married, it will only be to Zarka; otherwise, I won't marry anyone. 
[751.05] I'm swearing, you tell Mom on my behalf.
[796.12] Sister, can I ask something? Yes, go ahead!
[805.37] I didn't realize it before, but now I feel that...
[814.09] You must have felt so much pain when your husband got married.
[820.12] Yes, I used to feel a lot of pain, and that’s why I get angry.
[826.37] But after that, Murad explained to me that...
[831.20] Anyway, I know that you are not his wife.
[835.86] It's just a temporary affair; it will come to an end in few days.
[839.46] And now, there's no need to maintain any relationship; the doctor has said so too.
[846.50] Yes!
[850.28] But sister, there are many people in the world who don't have children.
[857.53] Nobody does that. I have a friend in America.
[862.49] Her elder sister did the same, she advised me. Tell me something...
[869.76] Have you ever loved someone?
[874.05] What is the stake in our love? Whatever we want, we don't get
[881.82] You have loved anyone? No, never!
[888.26] Nothing like that has happened. I can't accept it, you must have liked someone, at least.
[896.95] The one I liked, can't be mine. Oh, how can it not be?
[903.72] tell me I will become your sister and get him married.
[909.81] No sister, I don't want to get married to anyone.
[915.84] Then what will you do? Go back from here and continue with the same dancing and singing?
[923.45] I will do whatever is destined for me.
[928.85] Sister, for you it's only a deal, but for me, it's marriage.
[938.27] If I leave from here, then I will never marry again.
[948.45] Okay, this is your personal matter, I have cut this fruit, eat it,
[954.43] you have to take medicine also and now take some rest.
[958.56] [music]
