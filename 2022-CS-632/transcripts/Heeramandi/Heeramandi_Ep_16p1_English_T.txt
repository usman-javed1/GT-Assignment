[1.52] [Crying]
[8.12] Enough Auntie, for how long will you cry?
[12.72] Look at Vodka, he has gone absolutely crazy
[18.70] [Music]
[21.88] You know he has not shed a single tear yet
[30.08] How I can console him, I myself is ruined
[35.84] Zeenat ...
[40.36] Why did you leave so soon, she could have stayed with us for a few more days,
[47.88]  she could have spent more days as a bride. She bought so many pairs of clothes,
[53.76] with love she had made all of them, all of them are untouched.
[62.68] Auntie, when you cry like this,
[66.56] Zeenat's soul feels pain. She has left
[73.36] Look at Vodka, he has become rigid. If he continues like this, he too will die.
[81.88] What should I say to him? Shall I say Zeenat will come back?
[90.84] Shall I say, why you marry her?
[95.84] Shall I say, why are you crying now? What should I say to him? Tell me
[108.96] Come on, tell me. I don't have time.
[114.60] Zeenat ...
[120.20] I want to marry you.
[125.36] What? Marry me?
[129.43] Why? Have you gone mad?
[135.00] One who will marry you, will be crazy?  Zeenat I love you very much.
[142.60]  I will keep you in the house, I will give you the happiness of wives. What is that?
[148.80] Listen Chanda, another lover has been born for me. Who is your
[154.04] lover? Who made you lover Vodka? I am not talking to you, I
[161.48] am talking to Zeenat. Hey Hema, he is talking to me, he will marry me and
[167.88] like Chanda, I will become the mother of his children 
[169.64] and there will be only one woman left to dance in this brothel,
[172.64] that is Husna Bai
[177.52] Come on. Not now. Go Out. Let's fix the date. We will fix that too.
[184.88] Listen to me, what happened to you? Go away from here.
[191.84] listen to me 
[193.88] I am telling you the truth, Let's run from here, nobody will know.  
[201.62] I will run with you, I will run with you,
[208.48] Have you seen your face? Go away 
[219.24] [Music]
[243.62] [Music]
[263.56] Zeenat, what are you doing?
[268.72] Zeenat, what are you doing?
[272.56] Don't dance, you will fall
[279.73] You will fall,
[284.72] Zeenat, what are you doing? You will fall. Don't dance, you are not well?
[293.30] Vodka ...
[296.92] What are you doing here? Zeenat is dancing,
[307.00] Zeenat was dancing 
[312.64] Vodka ..
[318.48] Zeenat is no longer in this world.
[325.28] She was dancing, 
[331.40] she is not well, 
[336.68] she will fall down. Vodka listen
[342.52] please stop her from dancing. Listen to me
[348.25] [music] 
[351.32] She is sick.
[355.24] she is going to fall down,
[368.60] Hey ....
[372.88]  Hey Phoolan, Zeenat has made
[378.92]  whole area quite. I have never seen such silence in the brothels.
[387.16]  Lafray, Death is the name of Silence and if you are going to die,
[393.96] She is dead, now take care of Vodka. I have heard that if someone does not cries
[401.60] on death, then their grief can become worse. I know, I don't know. What should I do?
[411.52] Take him to doctor. Have you gone mad? 
[418.56] He doesn't come inside this room, he will go to the doctor?
[422.72] He is waiting for Zeenat on stairs,
[432.40] He doesn't need doctor. 
[438.44] The day he will believe that Zeenat is dead, he will cry
[444.12] This is the problem, how will he believe? How will this silence be broken?
[454.56] Oh friend, leave this, you go to your wife,
[462.76] she must be waiting for you. No friend, today
[469.40] I don't want to go today
[475.20] What has happened to Vodka? I said to him take care of yourself
[486.44] I was meant to be with him
[492.32]  
[498.92]  
[503.44] Aunty Guddu keeps asking about Zeenat again and again
[511.36] and Lafda was telling that Vodka is not fine and
[518.20] has not slept since that day,
[520.80]  he is very worried for him. He was saying it is
[531.16] very important for Vodka to cry and sleep 
[535.64] Where is Vodka? Has he left?
[541.04] Sitting on the stairs outside the door. He is not going anywhere.
[547.94] [Music]
[558.72]  I will talk to him.
[565.05] [Music]
[589.23] [Music]
[595.57] [Music]
[601.68] You also feel as if Zeenat is here right now,
[608.00] I also feel the same, I wake up while sleeping at night,
[617.04]  I feel that Zeenat is sitting close to me
[627.12]  it doesn't seem like she is,
[631.68] not here. Yes, Auntie
[638.04] she is here, she is inside. 
[648.44] Yes, I have just put her to sleep
[653.48] If she stays awake her health will get worse,
[659.80] Yes, her health will get worse, let her sleep. 
[663.24] But Vodka, If she will saw you here she will wake up.
[669.24] Do you want to give her trouble? What are you saying, Auntie? How can
[676.28]  I give her trouble? She was saying
[681.36] that she is having headache, I told her to take the pill
[688.24] but she did not listen. When does she listen to anyone.
[694.40] Yes,
[697.96] She insists a lot.
[702.68] If she wakes up now, the headache will get worse. Go to sleep. How long will you stay awake? 
[714.00] It's already midnight. No, I will sleep here 
[720.12] At night If she gets unwell, then who will take her to the hospital?
[724.04] Listen Vodka, If you sleep here at night,
[729.36] you will catch cold, then how you will wake up in the morning?
[734.12] Auntie, In the morning, when the sunlight falls on me, my eyes
[739.36] will open on their own and I will bring Halwa Puri for her. She likes it very much,
[745.84] For whom you will bring Halwa Puri? 
[752.12] I knew that you loved my Zeenat so much, I would have married you.
[758.52] Neither my Zeenat would have died
[762.84] nor you would have been sitting here crying. What are you talking about?
[770.80] Zeenat is not dead
[774.72] We have just got married, she is inside
[779.53] Zeenat is dead. We have
[786.08] buried her. She is dead.
[789.88] Zeenat is dead.  You are lying
[799.53] Zeenat ...
[812.56] Come, I will show you. I don't want to see. 
[816.24] Why don't you see, you have messed up my mind,
[818.28] where are we going? Let me show you, I will not go.
[826.60] Hey Vodka, don't you remember anything?  Do you remember that Zeenat Amaan used
[836.32] to dance? You remember she wants to get married
[842.36] Remember? Don't you remember that she told you
[847.40] that she has AIDS. Yes, she had AIDS. We all told you that she
[855.76] will die. She is dead now. No, she is not dead, she is not
[863.68] dead. She is not dead? No. Come with me
[873.20] Come here. Leave me. Why leave you. You lies. See this, see what is written,
[887.72] see whose grave is it, what is written here Vodka?
[901.52] It says Zeenat Amaan. Ask her, why she died?
[908.60] [Music]
[918.54] Ask her,
[925.72] ​Why she died, why she left her.
[934.24] ​Look, what you have done to Vodka, Zeenat. Talk to him
[940.96] ​
[955.16] Look Zeenat, check Vodka's condition?
[959.55] Hey Vodka ..... She is dead now
[976.04] She is dead now.
[981.72] Hey Vodka!
[984.92] Hey !
