[112.04] Husna Bai I swear to God, she was looking so
[120.08] healthy, she herself sit in the taxi and at the same time 
[124.84] Vodka give her hand like this She said, I don't want to hold, I swear by God, I
[129.40] am so happy to see Zeenat healthy, Allah knows. Thanks to Allah, just
[135.28] pray for my Zeenat to get back to health. By the way Auntie, Zeenat
[142.60] will be completely fine. Today when she woke up, there was a shine in her eyes. She was very happy.
[149.96] When I was dressing her up, I did not feel as if she was ill.
[155.44] I prayed that Zeenat would be fine than I will serve food in poor.
[160.36] I have serve, I have given money to Vodka, he has gone to shrine,
[166.20] after shrine, he will take her to the sea. I also prayed for Zeenat
[171.96] I gave Vodka money to put chadar to Babaji's shrine and will charity
[178.72] food there.
[183.16] May Allah accept this all. By the way Auntie
[188.80] Looking Zeenat like this, I felt as if without offering any charity or chadar, she
[196.44] will be fine. From your lips to God's ears. My Zeenat will be fine, I
[203.48] will light ghee lamps in the entire street. By the way
[206.92] Husna Bai, let me tell you one more thing. Zeenat has told Vodka that she
[213.36] is sick. Yes, she has said that if you come close to me, you will die. 
[219.80] But who told her? She has gone to the hospital several times to get herself checked.
[227.92] Someone must have told her, there are strange people there.
[231.84] Then it is okay. It's a very good thing that the poor girl has come to know
[238.72] that I mean she will spend the rest of her life happily. What's more, please hurry up,
[244.80] this is your work. Give me too, although it is sour, but from Chanda's hand, it is very sweet.
[253.32] Hey Chanda, you have never made food for us.

[360.08] Yes Shehram, have you found?
[364.88] I said to you
[371.08] we appreciate someone only after his departure.
[376.48] Emotions do not end by hiding them; rather, emotions exist only to
[383.20] express them.
[391.48] A person searches for shade on a long journey in the scorching heat, and
[397.96] you want to leave shade and travel alone in that scorching desert?
[403.80] Can't I become that shelter under whose shadow you can live your life peacefully
[409.92]  
[414.72] Are you still afraid of people, will anyone ask you whether you are alive or not?
[421.84] What are you going through? Someone asked this question. Someone came and asked you
[426.36] need anything. I know
[431.64] this did not happen. 
[436.04] This did not happen
[440.16] People do not stay in one place like you. They move forward,
[447.88] I am the only one or are you the one who stopped at one place.
[458.52] I am very tired Zara. I am
[466.48] very tired,
[470.36] you are not tired?
[480.12] I am tired, I am so tired that I can't even live anymore,
[486.20] you have to live. Not for your loneliness
[492.64] but for me 
[500.92] Please 
[510.32] I have given charity at shrine. I have brought some for the house too,
[516.68] in this there is a shopper for Chambelli and Hema too.
[522.48] Mother, I am having a headache. You went to the sea, you like it, the air
[530.76] is salty, that's why you got a headache, I will press it,
[534.44] and look at it, she has gone crazy, she says that
[539.80] I have AIDS, I am going to die, and the doctors talk nonsense. Look at her face,
[547.04] dying face is like this? Don't talk like this. You
[555.56] have a very long life.
[560.48] Why are you lying mother?
[566.56] Why are you giving me false hope?
[572.15]  For all of us, the result would be the same,
[578.64] but if we were not doing all this work,
[587.84] I would be setting up my family
[592.68] raising children 
[596.80] like Chanda, my children would also be going to school
[603.33] I would be living a happy life.
[609.08] I would have lived at the age of 100. Don't talk like this, my heart will burst. Don't
[617.36] say such things, my child. Mother, promise me
[624.44] that you will stop Hema
[630.20] Don't put Zarqa in 
[634.00]  this valley of death. 
[639.80] My soul will rest in peace.
[646.08] I finished my life in this dirty work
[654.08] no one else will get stuck in this the swamp. Promise me mother
[661.32]  I promise that I will not let any girl do this work again and see
[671.00] Vodka is not bringing customers any more
[675.96] no one will get a girl from here anymore.
[682.84] We will just do singing and dancing. Don't worry at all, you will be fine
[691.56] and I also promise that as long as I will stay alive, I will not let any customer
[698.80] touch any girl. You had promised me at night that
[705.00] you will not cry. You are crying again,
[710.68] You are also crying. We both are breaking our promise.
[720.88] No one will cry here.
[725.56] I am going, I have to arrange food for 40 people. Today is my Valima.
[732.60] How will this idiot get the Valima for 40 people?
[735.48] There are 10 people in the whole neighbourhood
[737.48] you will feed the rest to customers? I have invited some more people
[741.88] Don't worry Vodka, I have made arrangements. I have
[748.28] given the money to the hotel owner, he will feed food to 20 people, for 10 more he will home deliver.
[753.80] Arrangements are from my side. Oh dear, I love you.
[762.40] Zeenat, he is very lucky
[769.83] After so long, you went for some outing.
[775.76] He took you to the sea too? You must have enjoyed
[781.28] I have press your clothes wear them later, I will do makeup first. 
[790.24] Mother, I have to wear this dress. Yes, Mother you are making aunt a bride again?
[798.80] Yes, she looks beautiful as a bride. Yes, she looks very nice.
[807.20] Will you make Zarqa my bride? Have you gone mad? Again the same nonsense, you are not 
[813.24] getting married to Zarqa.
[816.08] Chanda...
[819.28] Do it.
[824.64] In this way, Zarqa will not die like me. I will marry Zarqa
[831.12] For my sake.
[834.64] Tomorrow is dinner for you at our house, I will make biryani for you. And
[841.64] tell me, what will you eat? Whatever you will make, I will eat. 
[849.12] Mother is marrying me to Zarqa. I am not lying. Zeenat Auntie also said.
[855.88] In this way Zarqa will be saved from dying like Auntie. I am going
[861.56] to tell Zarqa.
[869.20] Hey, bride is here.
[875.72] Come
[879.00] What have I said wrong?
[883.40] No, you said it absolutely right 
[889.12] Then promise me, you will get Zarqa married to Whisky?
[897.64] I promise but Chanda. Hema, I have agreed already.
[911.20] Zeenat wants the engagement to happen today. For my happiness if the engagement happens today
