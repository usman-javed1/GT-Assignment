[0.16] Oye, that's it, I have become silent because of my brother, otherwise I swear to God, you know
[5.92] your brother. Oye, now if he comes back
[12.44] after getting angry again, then it is good that I have not seen it, nor have I even said anything. You had
[18.96] to listen to him well, today it is your turn to wash the clothes, no
[25.48] friend, I will not do anything today, friend, I did not sleep the whole night yesterday, I did not sleep,
[31.28] do not talk much nonsense, keep boasting in your sleep all night, you have spoiled my mind,
[37.64] my friend. I saw in my dream that Zeenat Maan and I were dancing hand in hand.
[43.48] I think that if Zeenat Maan had not been a wife then she would not have
[49.68] danced for anyone but only for me. If she had not been a wife then why would she have danced? You keep babbling all night long,
[56.92] you have gone mad, you spoil your mind, I slept for a minute,
[62.92] if you keep babbling now at night, then I will pick you up and throw you out of the window and who made you donate money that
[69.52] night? Yes Yes, that's someone,
[78.08] I have to talk about some important thing, what important thing will I do, you friend, don't stay like Lokan,
[86.76] it is not wrong to say 'Changi Gal', he is very rotten, he is going, take care
[94.28] Champa, I am very scared, I don't know what Seth Karim
[100.96] will do . Doctorate is also about to come, don't know what will happen,
[109.80] seeing Chanda Chanda, who knows, if a son is born, then only he can leave all the work,
[120.52] if he has a child with a woman, then people also give him work and their right when he is
[125.68] young. Then it will be done, you leave all this and go away and you know that if you have a young son,
[131.80] then the woman can sleep with him, but I am telling you out of sympathy,
[137.80] don't tell anyone, oh no, you are right, really, if my If I have a son, I
[146.20] will not stay here. Hey brother, it was with great difficulty that
[151.72] the thought came to Seth Karim's mind. As soon as I left, I fell at his feet,
[156.80] folded my hands and apologized. I apologized even with my lap. Only then did the matter cool down a bit and
[162.24] Afzal was the one. So I was in the process of getting Lafda inside, I was very scared, I was very scared,
[169.40] these people have long hands, I told Seth Karim that Chachanda is going to be a mother,
[175.32] how can I send her, it was good, he said that
[181.04] no scoundrels are allowed here. Send it, oh where did you say no, why not, I also said this
[186.00] clearly, the girls refused to come and started saying I will come, then I will come myself, ok let me
[193.12] come, oh Champa, oh Champa, I will see if my mother or Husna Bhai
[202.28] If they find out anything, they will kill me. Don't worry, I won't
[206.20] tell anyone. Okay, take care of yourself. Yes, now I have come,
[211.44] why don't you talk to your father-in-law? What I mean is that you go to Salman uncle
[218.12] and talk to him. Shahram , you don't know many things,
[222.28] your mother knows everything,
[226.04] she has helped me a lot, I even talked to Salman uncle once,
[230.68] but he just gave a vague answer and said that I am fine and
[237.08] I did not speak in favor of Rehan
[241.88] but I think he also wants to give
[246.16] away this house. However, I am surprised that Salman uncle knows very well that you
[252.12] do not have parents, you do not have any relatives. Here, if this house is sold then where will you go, still
[257.56] thinking like this, it was just my
[262.00] bad luck that Rehman's death was an accident, if there was a child
[267.68] then neither would these people's attitude nor this would have happened to me,
[272.36] whatever be the case, you are their daughter-in-law, aren't you? Where are you, daughter-in-law
[280.64] Jairam, you are afraid of those people, I am not afraid of anyone, but when
[286.88] you have to live in this world, you have to walk with the people of the world,
[290.00] if you ever have any problem, you call me and you should definitely think about this.
[296.92] Leave it to me that you are the only one,
[302.52] you are telling the truth, and now you don't even come to meet me, what should I do, you
[311.04] call me when you have to go, yes, I also feel like talking,
[319.28] if you talk to aunty or Zeenat, then only that. The old
[324.80] talk of dancing and singing or
[331.52] singing songs is no longer the same thing as before. Now Hasti used to talk inside you. Earlier
[337.80] all that is over. Sometimes she used to call us for ice cream.
[341.92] Now [Music]
[348.72] Tu Lafaad
[353.52] Yes, are all men cheaters [Music]
[362.44] No no no Chanda Not all men are cheaters No
[366.32] cheaters Husna Aunty says all men are
[373.52] unfaithful and cheaters Na Aunty How does she know,
[378.92] has she ever tried any man in her life? And I have tried it
[386.40] and I didn't even say anything to her, she herself said that
[393.72] I will marry you, I just made up for this mistake of mine, leave her, now forget her, she never
[402.48] came back, all the throat cares, tell me, do you need something?
[409.32] [Music] Tujhe buta la
[415.20] de buta la If someone from the sky asks you to break the pieces, then
[421.44] let's give you Butala, just take care of yourself Chachanda, my heart gets spoiled.
[428.60] Son ke teri wala I
[438.28] aayi Husna Husna, who is I coming?
[443.92] Hey Doctorni Sahiba, Salam alekum, Well am I fine, Chanda, Chanda, I am
[451.36] fine in my room, come doctor,
[459.44] come chachanda doctor
[470.56] sa chanda
[474.76] chada, where are you going chanda
[482.68] and what is the matter with her brother. What has happened, Lafe, do you understand? Ask him, who brought up this child,
[489.60] his father, his brother, his father, neither his father nor his father, I will get him, save me, I will get
[501.48] him, sister-in-law, why are you being defamed, why are you being defamed,
[508.40] because you are our daughter- in-law? You were my daughter-in-law.
[513.44] Now I am not. If I were still your daughter-in-law, your attitude towards me would not have
[519.04] been like this. If you had stayed with us, then today you were our sister. Rehman died, but we
[525.00] are people. It is true that even today I am Zaira. I have come on Salman's request, he has said that you
[531.36] should come and live with us and sell this house, you know that I will not sell this house, then it
[538.28] is okay, brother, you are asking me to go to the court, the case is over, you know Sadika. Aunty,
[545.04] I have no other place to go, why am I? Come and stay with us, that is
[550.56] not the place, are you perhaps forgetting that you were the one who had thrown me out of that house, otherwise
[557.76] perhaps I would have been living with you even today. So when did you consider the house as a home
[564.16] and how did you live like a guest? Anyway, we cannot stay here for long.
[569.76] Abba had said to finish talking and come back. Anyway, it
[575.32] is very difficult to explain to Rehan Bhai, you know it very well. That you cannot win the case, the result will be the same
[582.16] without going to the court, and you should stop all these types of people coming
[588.08] to your house, you stop talking nonsense,
[594.44] there is no need for you to interfere in my caste matter so much. It is not your caste issue,
[598.56] even today you are sitting in our name and people think that you are our daughter-in-law, that
[604.24] day also Rihan had come to the locality, people have told 10 different things to us,
[608.88] so if we are not being defamed. Who else is saying 'Salaam-
[614.72] Welcome'? The house has been kept as a crossroads. He is walking towards the one with his mouth raised.
[620.80] Listen to whom he is saying, 'You Shahram, you go inside, I am coming, Amma got up from brother, who
[627.48] the people of the locality had heard and went away. You are seeing the same thing with your eyes today, now you
[632.92] must have understood why she doesn't want to live with us, what are you saying Shahram, you go
[638.80] from here [music]
[644.36] Please don't talk nonsense Tayaba, the reason for not staying in your house. Your
[649.32] words were No need to play too many tricks Simply vacate this house and forgive us
[654.96] Go and stay anywhere Let's go
[666.94] [Praise] [Music]
[669.52] [Praise] [Music]
[676.76] Now you know why I am not with these people They are very ill-mannered people, I
[682.28] told you that I talk to the same uncle,
[685.36] there is no use, he is also exactly like that, tell me, what is the use,
[692.32] the lawyer is making the agreement, in fact he must be coming,
[697.60] what is this slander? We were talking that sometimes I feel like strangulating her to
[704.48] death. Lara herself went away, leaving this trouble for me and the second
[710.72] uproar happened when the police station came, but left Chanda because of the child. She has told me
[716.80] 100 100. It's good that she got a change, otherwise we would have
[722.60] kept getting locked up in the police station every day. Leave it to her. Hey, whatever has happened has happened, don't keep chasing Chanda all the time.
[730.32] Hey Husna khala, a small child will come to the house. And I like children so much,
[735.32] I like them so much, what should I tell you? Well, you gave this lesson to Chanda, not she, I do
[741.80] n't even know that there is such a thing, now just keep quiet, tell me what Chanda
[747.32] is doing, hey. What to do, she lies on the bed the whole day. Today she is going
[752.00] to the doctor with Zeenat. Okay, just pray that Allah gives her a daughter,
[760.16] Amen, she will be bright, so don't curse like this Zeenat, I am cursing
[766.68] a little, I am just saying this. I am wondering what will happen if it is a girl,
[770.52] I will die under the train, don't talk nonsense, look, I am not going with you, just
[776.52] go alone, I don't know where she is going, where is she going, listen to
[783.68] her words. She says that if it is a girl then she will commit suicide by coming under the train and she does
[789.40] n't even know anything, I am not going with her, call Amma, she will take her, I
[795.44] will come
[799.16] with you, but don't talk like this or you will displease Allah. There are things to be done,
[804.48] you don't know, Allah knows how many prayers I cry at night,
[811.16] either give me a son or don't let me and the daughter live, how
[817.84] can he get angry, can't I see, if a daughter is born then
[822.92] another one. Only Tawaf will be born and we can't see what is our life
[827.12] [Music] Even if there is no respect then what is the
[833.36] use of living, if a daughter is born then neither will I myself be alive nor will I let her live. Have you heard?
[841.28] You are talking so much nonsense, go take her away, I am not going, oh oh oh
[850.32] my daughter, whatever happens is a blessing from Allah, you are doing
[858.56] wonders, oh daughter or son,
[864.36] it is an excuse to live. What else is there just
[871.32] to live, I don't want to
[876.12] quarrel Okay
[879.89] [Music] Come on
[885.21] [Music]
[896.60] Or please sit
[905.44] Sharaya I wanted to talk to you, that's why I came Well done, if you had not come then
[911.68] maybe I would have come What will you take, not tea or coffee No, nothing. Anyway, your parents
[919.00] have gone out, you live alone and you
[926.24] have to go somewhere even to eat and drink. You have a lot of knowledge about me,
[933.84] Shahram Mia, whatever I talk to you, you will listen to it with a very cool heart and mind.
[940.32] She used to live here and used to meet you people, it was fine but she lives alone and the whole
[948.12] world knows that she is our daughter-in-law, your coming and going to her house like this
[954.32] defames her and us too, Salman uncle, you are an accusation on a decent woman.
[960.80] They are defaming her and that too in this age defamation does not see age. Shahram
[967.68] Mia, I have come to you because of my relation with sir and you
[973.16] will understand my point and explain to Zara that she should leave the house and come back to us
[980.48] . That is, where she has no respect, she
[985.16] should go there and anyway,
[989.64] her husband had given her that house, so you people should respect her, on the contrary,
[996.16] you are defaming her, she is getting defamed because of you,
[1000.96] Shahram. If he is so noble then why don't you marry him
[1016.20] [music]
