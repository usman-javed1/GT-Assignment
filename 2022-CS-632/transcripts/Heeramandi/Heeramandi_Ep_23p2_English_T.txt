[0.28] Shehram, I am not able to understand If it was the same robbery as it happens nowadays,
[5.68] then why didn't he snatch any wallet, mobile, car or anything from you?
[11.60] Another thing is coming to my mind, maybe that boy Whiskey did this? No
[18.84] no, he don't have this much courage. You hit him, it is possible that he
[25.52] did this in anger. He could only make noise,
[30.92] I don't know. Asalam alikum ...Walikum asalam. How are you?  Much better
[39.60] but I am sorry, I can't get up. It's okay, you lie down. Did you found out
[44.96] who stabbed? No
[49.36] I think someone wanted to rob me. He saw someone coming and ran away from there.
[55.72] I still don't understand why he stabbed when you
[61.76] didn't protest on anything. Same thing we are also not able to understand that Shehram has
[66.76] no enmity with anyone. I will bring tea for both of you
[75.23] [Music]
[84.00] Now you have done the right thing, absolutely right,
[90.64] now just pray to Allah that the sooner the matter is resolved, the better it is,
[95.32] But I am still hanging. I told you it would be
[102.12] difficult Shumail. Okay, tell me, there was any meeting between the two? Nothing
[109.84] special, a little conversation, just nothing special, I think, Murad.
[116.84] Despite wanting, is not able to do it, as something stops him. You Shumail
[123.44] You are stopping him.
[129.56] Your presence stops him. What should I do?
[132.96] Don't go home today, stay here with me. Send Murad alone to Zarka.
[142.20] [Music] 
[156.40] I feel that I will never know who he was for the rest of my life. So
[162.04] why don't you file an FIR? In whose name shall I file?
[167.48] Leave this. As you wish! Shall we leave?
[173.92] I am staying here tonight. Yes Murad, let her stay here today. You can pick her in the morning.
[182.60] As you both wish. Anyway, take care of yourself and if
[191.36] possible don't go to the office. Come on, it will be fine in a day or two. It
[197.44] will not be fine in a day or two if you don't take care and please don't let him go to the office. 
[202.04] I will not let him go. Great, I am leaving now.
[208.76] Khuda Hafiz.
[214.76] Murad,
[219.20] Zarka, is alone at home
[225.32] and she is your wife.
[231.16] Please
[234.60] you know what I am trying to say.
[245.28] [Music] 
[272.00] Who is there? Murad!
[280.96] Thank you.
[284.92]  
[291.32] Where is shumail sister ? She will stay there today
[300.60] How is uncle's health? He is better.
[307.73]  
[312.40] You had dinner?
[319.56] No, I was waiting for you guys
[326.00] I will change and then we will have dinner together. 
[388.04] Wound is deep? Uncle ... No, he is out of danger now, I mean he is
[397.00] is fine, but he got 12 stitches
[405.44] Did he found out who had done this?
[412.75] No ...
[417.48] nothing has been found yet
[422.08] and there is no robbery either.
[431.72] Will you drink coffee? It would be great, if I get after dinner.
[443.52] You will drink coffee? If you will drink, then I will also drink.
[452.04] I will make it. Yes
[462.59] [Music] 
[468.66] [Music]
[489.16] Wait, I will make it, that day you
[493.96] had burnt your hand
[498.86] [Music] 
[548.65]  
[552.24] Now that hand of yours is fine, the one that was burnt?
[559.12] It's better now.
[564.60]  
[569.96] I wanted to talk to you about something important.
[576.92] Tell me, what you want to say? Well, I
[583.76] was thinking that you never, I mean you had never asked for anything. I don't really know
[589.76] what you want,
[596.00] you can ask, you can say whatever you want.
[605.00] You can say to Shumail,
[612.84] I don't want anything
[616.76] You
[622.36] were trying to say something
[626.24] I was saying that what is the use of me staying here silently
[633.64] like this
[639.32] then you leave me
[645.44] [Music]
[664.20] [Music] 
[681.59] [Music]
[701.04] Murad, where are you?
[706.52] I have been waiting for you for a long time. I thought that you will come
[712.40] Okay, then come quickly. I am waiting
[718.52] Okay!
[729.72] Uncle has woken up? He slept after taking the sleeping pill, I did not wake him up. It's good, let him rest.
[738.20] I had received a call from Murad, he is coming. Shumail
[744.20] do not fight with him. I know
[753.08] Thanks.
[758.90] [Music]
[788.04] You are not happy?
[791.48] I am happy
[798.60] You are quite so I thought
[806.12] I was thinking Shumail sister will be more happy about this.
[811.52] She want this all as soon as possible
[816.84] What happened between you, Shumail and antie ... I was not part of it
[824.08] I know, 
[830.00] Zarka, I feel as I have done a big loss with my hands,
[839.24] Don't say anything. It's a deal.
[843.88] And there is always profit and loss in the deal.
[848.52] I pray you get profit,
[854.56] I don't know but I am feeling bad about you.
[860.72] very insulting for you
[872.44] You don't have CD? Actually yesterday the car
[877.92] had gone for service. All the stuff is lying in the garage.
[884.36] Are you fond of listening to songs? Yes
[892.60] You do not wear anything in your hands, I
[898.20] mean, no bangles etc. Glass bangles, I like their tinkling sound. I
[907.08] just like their sound when it breaks, it injure  wrist
[919.80] My wrist got cut many times from it.
[955.24] It's been so long, I don't know where Murad is? He will come, at this time the traffic is also heavy,
[960.36] Hello I am coming Murad. Call him inside. He has to drop me
[968.28] then he will have to go to the office, it will be too late, we will come tomorrow. Khuda Hafiz
[972.32] Okay listen, you have promised me that you will not fight with him.
[978.92] Don't worry, I remember, okay. I am coming, to leave you. No, you stay here
[983.48] with uncle, I will go, Khuda Hafiz
[997.76] Asalam alikum sister. Walikum asalam
