[21.56] Zenu, oh Zenu, you are not ready yet.
[30.80] Mother, my full name is Zeenat Amaan. Yes, Zeenat Amaan, why are you not ready? Lafrah,
[40.28] must be bringing the customer, you are always late. Remember 
[48.84] When customers enter, their eyes should be immediately drawn to your dazzling beauty. All girls are outside already
[54.52] and you are still getting ready, Customer will move on. Why move on? I gave Rs.50 to Lafrah. What happened to
[62.60] you? You gave him the money even before he brought a customer. When he brings a customer, he
[67.08] immediately ask for his commission and than drink wadka.
[72.28] Hey Mother, he doesn't drink Wadka, he drinks local wine. He just
[78.32] says to show off that he drinks Wadka and mother, I am telling you one more thing clearly, there is no need to spend my
[83.80] money on your sister. Tell Chanda to earn her own money, get her mother treated,
[88.04] Okay, don't talk nonsense, she is not Chanda's mother, she is also my real sister, she has the right
[94.04] on my earnings. You earn yourself? Okay, there is no need to talk much nonsense,
[99.60] By the way,  a little make-up and you will look no less than Meena Kumari. 
[110.28] [ Singing ]
[122.20]  
[128.56] Hey Babra, no one has come yet. Someone will definitely come
[133.49] Hey, whom you are taking with you?
[141.48] You have not seen such a thing in your entire life, just see her once,
[148.84] Hey Lafray, I knew you were about to come. Sir, come this side. I will come after dropping him
[157.04]  Come on. Stop him, he seems to be rich. [Singing]
[164.60] [Singing]
[172.60] Chanda, you are not ready yet, I have to say it every day, get ready,
[179.40] Come on, get up. Atleast think about your mother. Zeenat has clearly said that
[185.84] she cannot earn for your mother and I too cannot force her.
[192.08] Hey Chanda, you can sing, you can dance. I also earn money by dancing. I, myself taking care of 
[201.12] of my mother, what are you taunting about?
[206.72] About her treatment. Now she cannot be treated in any charity hospital.
[210.92] Look Chanda, you know very well that you cost the most. If you want,
[216.44] your mother will be able to stand on the steps within a month, but if you don't want, then
[222.04] Get up, get ready, come out quickly.
[229.78] Hey, Phoolan ... What else is the matter, my
[235.04] king? Prepare paan very well and send up here. Send with Vodka. Just sending. Be quick
[245.68] Hey Vodka, I am preparing paan and giving it to you, go upstairs and give it to Lafra. I
[253.68] am not Lafrah's servant, tell him to come and take it himself, I am busy doing very important work,
[259.88] Every person here is very busy, playing havoc, busy
[269.76] as if he is doing government work. Get lost. Hey, Maqbool, come here, I will give you the
[277.40] paan. Go and give upstairs to Lafrah. 
[283.16] Ruined my shot.
[292.88] I had instructed you to go and get an injection from the doctor, but it appears that it hasnâ€™t been done. Hey
[301.60] Mother, the doctor is a fake and also gives fake vaccines. She even charges Rs. 50 for a vaccine. And
[307.76] listen, refuse Lafrah  Don't bring that moustaches one man  
[312.76]   in the future. Hey, go and apply ice. Don't apply oil.
[319.32] I'll go and see her. Let Lafrah come.

[390.28] Aunt ... she doesn't even do the work herself,
[395.72] she doesn't even let anyone else do it, you sit down, sit down, sit down, I will bring you.
[400.20] Sit down, sit down, my brother, I will bring for you. Come and see,
[406.76] Mother is not getting up, she is this lying here. Mother ... Dil Ara what  happen to you?
[417.64] Phoolan, where did you disappear,
[423.60] What happen? A big mess has happened here. They took Chanda's mother
[429.60]  mother Dil Ara to the hospital, she has had a heart attack. Prostitutes don't have heart.
[434.84] how they can have a heart attack. Man, this is not a joke, go up and see Chanda is crying. The doctor had come,
[439.76] put her in his car and took. Are you telling the truth?
[445.60] What reward do I get by lying? Yes man, you don't get any reward by lying, okay
[450.24] you take care of the shop, I am coming in a short while. And don't touch the flowers.
[455.56] otherwise I will charge money from you. This is your shop not Sridevi whom
[459.76] I will touch. How unlucky I am and how unlucky
[467.04] you are. Neither do you know who your father is nor do I know who my father is.
[474.12] I wonder who would know who their father is
[481.48] How much pride must they have,
[485.32]  I wish, I could give you this pride. Mother, what pride looks like?
[492.65] I don't know. But in my youth,
[499.32] when I used to walk with my neck high, my mother used to say that this is the pride of youth.
[508.44] One day, When the end of life will come, this pride will fall at your feet. Hey Chanda
[519.92] Mother has come?
[529.60] Mother ... what happen to you? Mother, how will I live without you.
[542.67] [music]
[552.64] Despite being a Prostitute, She often taught others about goodness. It's good, she is dead
[560.72] I provided her with the best possible options, but she ended up spoiling
[564.56] Chanda. She has been lying in the dark for four days now, yes,
[570.48] I will decorate the bed, I will decorate the bed, I will decorate the bed, she don't know that one
[577.44] cannot decorate the bed before marriage. Now tell me one thing, will anyone marry her here?
[583.60]  it's good that she died, it's very
[587.84] good that she died, which bank balance has she left behind which Chanda can eats all her life
[592.96] Oh stop it my friend. For God's sake, Stop it now. You are high now.
[602.08] Otherwise all the night you will keep sitting here and abusing them . It is good she is  dead. Oh my friend,
[610.92] if Lafrah is not around, then this market will become silent. As without music and tabla we can't sleep,
[617.80] similarly, I can't sleep even without listening to his abuses,
[622.24] I don't abuse anyone
[629.88] My friend has spoken the truth. Listen to me, how long will this mourning continue?
[639.88] I don't know. Leave this all. Sing a song. Hey Vodka,
[647.08]  you finish the whole bottle. No dear, I
[653.84] just took one sip, still some remaining inside. Sing any song dear
[660.96] [ Singing ]
[671.92] [ Singing ]
[684.76] It's been so many days because of you, it's dark here.
[691.64] Dil Ara aunty has never kept brothel dark. Chanda, 
[699.20] We finish mourning in three days,
[704.44] if we do this then how will we fill our stomach. Get up, get ready,
[710.64] I don't feel like doing anything 
[721.54]  
[735.56] Chanda Dil Ara was crazy. She used to see
[742.36] such dreams which she should not have seen, customers come in the dreams of a courtesan too
[748.52] Chanda
[752.88] and you are also a courtesan,
[757.36] you too have to live and die here Chanda. And here 
[764.44] the woman whose body has more wounds due to labor is richer,
[771.64] this is our fate, we cannot fill our stomach with just dancing,
[776.76] this is a very long life which has to be spent in this brothel,
[782.64] You should ensure only a few customers. Respectable people can give a lot of wealth,
[792.44] but not a handful of respect 
[797.12] But aunty, I don't like this work, I don't want to do it. What else will you do? Hey,
[806.08] you can't even handle washing utensils by going from house to house. Say to anyone for job.
[812.04] They will kick you out.
[816.32] Aunty, there must be someone who will marry me,
[822.12] take me away from here,
[828.96] Listen Chanda
[835.48] don't listen to the woman inside, the woman inside everyone is not a courtesan
[840.70] The woman inside everyone
[844.12] would die for sweet words of loyalty and love
[850.92] but she wants to remain with only one person,
[856.08] but this loyalty is not there in men, they leave their respectable wives and
[862.16] come to lick our soles,
[865.56] how will anyone marry you?
[871.24] Leave such things, otherwise you will dye of hunger,
[878.12] she is dead

[954.96] Whenever a good customer comes, go straight to Chanda's brothel. 
[960.84] Zeenat Aman is sitting here ... Chammak Challo and no one even pays attention to Chanda. Three customers have broken
[967.24] by Zeenat Aaman. Hey, why are you cursing Zeenat Aaman? The courtesan
[972.48] should throw tantrums like Zeenat Aman. You stand outside and
[978.80] come inside with a thud. Hey, go and learn some from neighbour's courtesan.
[985.52] Heera Bai, I have come for the last time. If your Hema created any trouble,
[991.52]  I will not come, I don't want to go to jail. If she does any such thing then
[998.36] I will strangle her and go to jail myself. Welcome sir, welcome,

[1023.00] capable of, if you want this all can be over, it is a favour of nature sir that
[1029.48] people like you have made a shadow over our heads. Hey, just standing here, won't you ask
[1035.96] sir, what will you eat or drink? Where is Chanda?

[1120.84] and will also tell you whether I have good manners or not.
