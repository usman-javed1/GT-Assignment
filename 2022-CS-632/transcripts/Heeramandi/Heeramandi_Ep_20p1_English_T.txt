[12.30] [Music]
[37.04] By hiding your feelings, you think you will fool me?
[43.52] I know that you are in pain, I am happy
[49.32] very happy Murad. Don't lie to me, no woman in the world
[56.68] can be happy after getting her husband married.
[64.52] I wanted to save you and myself from this agony
[70.12] You are with me Murad. You will not let
[76.36] anything happen to me, you will save me, nor you will drown, nor you will let me drown,
[85.88] When God has not planned a child for us, 
[93.80] then by doing all this, you are displeasing Allah, I am very afraid of this. I
[100.60] pray for this all night long. I remain in prostration all night.
[104.20]  remind him that he has said, keep trying, I will give you success.
[111.28] We will try Murad. It's not a try, this is a fight with God,
[121.08] look, we still have time, we can send her back,
[129.56] we send her back, give her the money, do whatever you have to do,
[135.88] send her back. No, Murad
[141.16] You have done so much for me, don't step back now.
[149.60]  
[152.96] I didn't want to do all this. For my sake!
[159.86] [Music]
[166.16] I also make a promise to you,
[170.84] this woman is in this house only because of you, you send her back any day you want, I
[178.00] won't say anything.
[185.28] Shumail...
[195.80] Go, she is waiting for you.
[201.36] Nothing will happen to your heart? 
[214.36] You won't even stop me? No
[222.84] Go!
[239.33] [Music]
[247.22] Go....
[255.12] Go now
[299.80]  
[307.36] [Crying]
[349.32] You are very beautiful!
[356.04] Shumail had told me to see you first before marriage
[361.24] but I refused. Because I had nothing to do with all these things
[367.36] [Music]
[370.88] But today I am surprised that
[375.44] Shumail liked such a beautiful girl for me
[391.08] Your eyes speaks
[395.40] If you don't say anything but I understood everything
[403.55] [Music]
[411.60] Why did I buy this ring, I don't even know
[417.48] Even Shumail doesn't know about it,
[422.16] so how can I know, just like this,
[429.92] buy it secretly for you. May I?
[452.72] Mother says
[456.68] that a man is of raw feelings.
[465.20] Your mother is right. Earlier I did not want
[470.84] to come in this room and now my heart does not want me to
[478.32] to go out of this room ever.
[481.56] Murad ....
[486.72] Where are you going, Shumail? You yourself have sent him there, now
[494.12] will you stop him? Whatever you have done, now you will
[500.48] have to be patient on this, you have to tolerate everything
[509.28] [Music] 
[523.72] Chande Chande, what is wrong? You have not said a thing since you came
[530.68] back from wedding. Why are you quite?
[533.92] What happened?
[538.44] Why are you troubling Chande? Say something, what happened? Listen, you are
[548.84] sad because Zarka did'nt become your daughter in Law? Is this the reason?
[554.52] Zarka, have not become your daughter in law, that's why you are crying?
[561.84] What's the matter? Yes
[566.96] Maybe that's why.
[574.40] I am a woman,
[577.48] I can understand other woman feelings, I had
[587.48] seen love for Guddu in Zarka's eyes.
[593.16] and today 
[600.88] Today in her husband's first wife, I saw
[607.44] restlessness in her eyes.
[611.16]  
[617.84] Why don't only women have to bear all the sorrows in this world? Don't talk like this
[628.76] even a man also suffers, everyone gets sorrows. You are
[637.84] crying for the sake of your child, it's useless to cry over this all.
[641.44] He is insensitive person. He doesn't care about anyone.
[646.84] He is mean. Your son is just like his father.
[655.91] Yes, he is just like his father,
[666.28] Then don't cry for him. When you cry, my heart burst. Leave this, I will
[676.76] get nice tea for you. When you cries like this, something happens to me. 
[682.84] Come on now, Smile! I am bringing tea for you.
[699.08] [Music] 
[711.51] [Music]
[722.11] [Music]
[766.57] If there is still a good girl in you, then it
[772.12] is my duty to take you out of this filth and take you to my home. 
[777.21] Will you wait for me?
[781.48] It will take me few days to come back to you. I
[786.52] will talk to my parents and then take you.
[790.36] Trust me, I will definitely come.
[796.72] Sir, are you sure that you will come back?
[802.20] Yes, I am sure of it,
[806.60] You will not forget me?
[811.26] No ...
[814.48] I will wait for you. Just remember that a girl named Chanda 
[820.92] will be waiting for you, neither will she sleep nor will she die
[840.65] [music]
[851.16] She loves you very much, Whiskey. I don't love her.
[857.76] You don't feel sad? Sad for what? About Zarka's marriage.
[865.64] I am happy, a courtesan got married because of me, what else do you need
[869.84] and anyway, she and her mother got Rupees 10 lakhs, I did not get anything through the contract.
[874.04] Zarka says that you have sold her.
[878.80] Tell me one thing, I had refused, I had told Madam to select some
[883.68] other girl, She had come to talk to you, Zarka herself got ready, but why do you all
[888.12] blame me for everything?
[891.20] Okay, leave this. Tell me Whisky, have you ever fallen in love with anyone? Thank God
[899.28] I have never been in love. What if you fall in love?
[904.82]  
[908.40] Then I don't know, but Lafrah is right. The life of a pimp and prostitute is same, neither do they
[915.96] ever get married nor do they fall in love.
[917.75] Come on, let's go home, I am feeling very sleepy
[929.84] Mother, why are you sad? You should be happy. You gave your daughter
[934.44] away as a bride and this is what you wanted, isn't it? I am not sad
[942.76] because I made her a bride and left. I am sad because one day she will get divorce
[949.76] and she will also come back. Mother, this is bound to happen, now
[956.20] there is no need to be sad about it, see, everything will be fine when she comes back
[962.24] We will leave this place and will get her married at some other better place and in the new place where 
[968.96] we will shift, no one will even know who we are and where we have come from. You
[974.52] are right Pari. When Zarka will come back we will leave this house, then I
[982.88] will get both of you married at a good place. So mother, stop being sad, leave
[989.52] everything to God, He knows all our sorrows and all our compulsions.
[996.16]  Mother, we will go to Zarka's place tomorrow? Yes, we will go. Mother, I will also
[1006.28] go with you, we will bring Zarka here as well. Mother, all girls visits there parents house next day of their wedding?
[1011.76] Come on, let's go to sleep. What if we couldn't wake up on time.
[1015.60] Let me just clean up this all.
