[0.04] Hey, what happened to you, have you been possessed by a ghost again? Aunty, whatever happens, I have decided
[5.72] that I will not dance anymore, I have accumulated a lot, I
[10.84] have exhausted myself, I have enough to feed Guddu and myself. I will not be a burden on anyone.
[17.48] Every six months or a year, someone or the other runs into you.
[22.24] You know we have no survival without dancing and anyway, Whiskey
[28.44] sees you dancing and does not see anyone going in and out of your room. The market
[32.64] knows that you only dance and do nothing else. If you stop dancing,
[38.24] what will you do if you get drunk tomorrow? You understand Guddu, he is intelligent, he will understand. What do you
[44.64] think, he will never know that you are doing Tawaf and Jab Bada. If this happens then he will also come to know
[50.24] what a courtesan does, he will never believe it Chanda, when you
[56.60] will tell him that you have never been sold, yes and if tomorrow he asks you who
[62.60] is his father, what answer will you give, you will get into trouble in school. His name is written instead of his father, he thinks that
[68.12] Lafda is his father. Yes, he is all right, he is a child, that's why when he grows up, he
[75.52] will also come to know that Lafda is not his father, then what will you tell after seeing him, Chanda,
[81.56] the child of the fish, water. I can grow only if I take it out, then it will die, it is your choice, whatever
[88.64] you want to tell, tell me,
[96.00] I understand, I don't understand, what happens in a few days,
[103.32] Oye, take it out, take it out, when did I gamble?
[110.32] So I was playing cards, brother, you bastard, you are refusing, I am not refusing, I will give
[115.84] you money, I die for money, one is spoiling me, on top of that he also asks for money,
[121.84] Oye, I am spoiling you, come here, leave me, my child. I am there, oh you
[129.76] are left, oh you sell the elders and eat them oh she blinked looking at them, look quickly where are you going,
[136.40] you tell Amma, it is useless for me to gamble, oh come here oh run away
[141.00] [praise] I am spoiled, I am born spoiled.
[147.40] He blames me, he also won, if you are born in Jawadi,
[157.16] then come everyone, come come, no brother, no brother, I have brought the bull, come,
[166.88] keep the honor, yes, it is the master's man, yes, I will bring Zeenat now, just a minute, money. So
[174.76] give it, Hi sir, I have sent the money to Adva. Hey sir, what was the need for it?
[180.44] It is very heavy, otherwise you have caused me a lot of trouble, you sit, I will send you right now,
[187.12] don't worry, ask for some tea and water, take the scene quickly, I will take it. Come quickly
[194.00] and this is a very amazing thing sir, if you see it then
[200.00] you will do it. Hey Zeenat, what is this, she is sleeping here, Ijaaz Batna has sent a man over there,
[206.20] Amma, I am not feeling well,
[211.48] I don't feel like going anywhere. Hey Zeenat, don't do this amazing thing. 5 Saheb has sent me for Haj,
[219.68] Amma, I don't have the courage, hey, take some courage, I will come
[226.28] with you, what will happen if you go, I don't have the courage to dance at all, Amma, my whole
[233.76] body is hurting, then tell Chanda. Should I go
[238.72] ? Hey, when will Chanda agree, then
[249.84] it is better to ask. I will talk. Eat the bag and see what has come. Oh
[258.32] yes, it is not much. Oh, it is a very good bag. I get it from India. Do you
[264.20] need anything else, some bottle, some food, some prayer? No, no, it's okay, someone
[270.08] can do something amazing
[272.76] for us , Fafre Nat's health is very bad, she won't be able to go,
[280.24] what are you talking about, I heard brother, you sang with such difficulty, above, I mean, she
[286.72] is having a tantrum after eating the food, it is not a tantrum. I had prepared her but she
[291.88] is not able to get up from the bed, she is very ill,
[297.88] what else should I do, convince Chanda by doing this, she will go away, see today, I
[304.60] heard brother, do not take Chanda's name, she will not dance much with Zeenat. It was discussed that send her, she
[310.28] can't go, you tell Chanda, oh, I can't make Chanda, I do wonders,
[315.32] you send it to Zeenat, you, oh what's the matter, Bhai Saheb had told me to come quickly, O Saheb, is
[321.52] Zeenat's health fine? No, Husna Bhai, please return the money. Oh, what kind of method are you talking about?
[327.40] My mother has kept the entire program as a punishment. The whole program will be spoiled. You
[332.00] guys are speaking dumbly. No sir, it is not like that, the girl's health
[338.40] is very bad. She can't get up from the bed, or your money, I don't want the money back, I
[344.12] will not spoil the friendship of sir, make some other arrangement for me, you will have other girls too,
[350.68] so do this so that you prepare Chambli, she
[357.12] will go away or she will also get the money. Give it, okay, let's go, let me show you Jasmine,
[364.60] how is Jasmine? Come, come, come, come, I have seen the name of Jasmine, its fragrance is also the same.

[422.24] I have done my school work, yes,
[426.92] I have done it, I said to Lafda that I am with you. You will go to school and explain to your teacher that you
[433.00] were ill, that is why you did not come to school. No Ma, I will tell you myself that my grandmother
[437.84] was dead. You are talking nonsense. If you lie then Lafda
[442.88] will also lie. I was unwell, ok shut up.
[449.80] Keep your notebooks and go
[453.32] to sleep. Now close your eyes and lie
[470.04] down. You know Guddu, I want you to study and
[475.92] become a great man. When you grow up, we
[481.20] will not stay here, we will go somewhere else, to a nice place,
[485.92] to a very nice home. I will marry you mother, I will marry Jarka and she
[493.96] is very good, no Guddu, not Jarka, I
[500.52] will marry you in a noble family, I don't want to marry a rich family, I will only marry Jarka, you
[505.20] know she dances very well. I will marry her, I will get a lot of money,
[511.16] then nonsense, how many times have you told me not to do such things
[517.52] and this school thing you keep roaming around, I don't like it at all,
[524.00] I come straight home from school and stay locked in the room now. Lie down and
[539.76] see, Guddu, you will not understand
[545.00] the things I say today,
[547.60] but when you grow up, you
[552.16] will understand everything, son, respect is a big thing, a person
[557.92] should live with respect, this dancing and singing is not a good thing,
[562.80] I want when You will grow up, stand on your own feet, yes,
[570.92] it is okay to raise your wife and children with your earnings, okay Amma, when I grow up, I
[578.32] will run the protection like Vatka. You know that Vatka is taking protection.
[584.36] Oh, you did not tell me, yes, you told me. In a few days, his protection will come.
[590.88] He was saying that he will bring his children under the protection of his son. When I grow up,
[596.44] I will also take protection, then after bringing a cow for you,
[600.68] again you talked nonsense, I was talking about work,
[606.36] okay. Just close your eyes, gold
[611.68] kiss, how did you say, how did you take his name, I heard you asking, brother, do you even know that
[617.96] I get turned on by this, not by this, we respect you so much,
[625.52] the stem of your zero in front of the song talks to me. And I mean,
[631.48] how did you take Chanda's name? Hey, look, listen to me, if Zeenat
[636.40] was unwell, I took Chanda's name, then what trouble has come, what sky has fallen
[640.44] down, yes yes, the sky has fallen, Usna Bhai. I explained to you a thousand times that Chada will not dance, it
[647.64] will never happen, there will not be even doomsday, she will not go to that bad man's house and
[652.28] do anything for the rest of her life. Hey, have you gone crazy, what is happening, why are you making so much noise, you are
[656.12] talking strange. She is a good girl, you tell me what to say, hey, what can you
[661.60] tell, I will tell you, look, Chanda, Ijaz Bhatt had sent a man to her house, he had
[668.48] paid full 5000 rupees, he gave full 5000, Zeenat was unwell, so I said, go away, Janda, she went on like this for a long time.
[674.48] If you will go, then you keep quiet, then what trouble will happen if Chanda goes, look Chanda,
[684.00] we have done 100 things for you, we have supported you in your bad times, so if today
[690.32] is our bad time, then you will not support us, are you right? Aunty,

[702.60] will serve Zeenat too, I will wash the utensils, you can get me
[707.60] to do whatever you want, but I have already said that I will not dance,
