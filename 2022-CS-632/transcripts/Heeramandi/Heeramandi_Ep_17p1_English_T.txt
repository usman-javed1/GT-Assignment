[1.71] [Music] 
[32.28] Why you have come here?
[35.76] I have come to see you
[40.20] You want to see when I will die? Mother Why do you talk like this? 
[47.60] Who told you that I bring girls from Hyderabad? I swear, whoever is saying
[52.96] is lying. You are telling lies,
[58.12] You think, I am blind and deaf,
[64.24] I can't see or hear anything? The customers brought by you
[68.52] come to my door looking for you, through them I come to know about your work.
[72.52] Why did I give you Rickshaw? Can't you stop bringing these customers? I
[78.84] will leave Hema Aunty, Zarka, Pari will dye of hunger, should I see them dying?
[87.04] I don't send you that earning which is given by customers,
[92.12] whatever I earn from the rickshaw, I keep that amount separate. I swear by Allah,
[98.60] I send only that and you returns it. I don't want your
[105.68] earnings. How much I wanted you to get educated.
[111.04] If you had been working as a clerk somewhere, we would be living peacefully.
[120.68] You would have been eating respectfully.
[125.40] Vodka has spoiled you. Mother, don't say anything to him
[131.60] I chose this work myself. You abuses me, that's enough for me
[139.62] [Music]
[146.92] This money is my rickshaw earnings
[153.56] I know, You have never had forbidden and I have sworn that I will never feed you
[158.24] [Music]
[182.68]  
[186.96] I want a girl who can be my partner in the dance party. Full Flash modern
[193.76] You have called me for this work? I do such work on the phone,
[199.48] you are feeding me ice cream by bringing in this mall? One more thing And
[205.60] Girl should be educated 
[210.08] She is educated
[213.48] She has been dance partner in big parties. Just tell me when is the party?
[222.40] How I can tell without seeing girl. I will meet her first talk to her 
[232.08] I have apartment in Clifton. This is my card. Will see soon then.
[241.88] sir you know, my name is Whiskey, how can I deny my words?
[248.00] sir, the girl will reach tomorrow, why are you taking tension?
[253.60] Sir, you had asked for the party, I will deliver,
[266.72] Think about it, it is a police case. Although, they did not get any deep wounds, if you say. No
[276.24] we don't want to file any case against him, you just bandage the girl quickly,
[282.68] we have to go. I have bandaged. I am sending her. Thank you doctor
[289.36] Thank you Auntie. It was not my fault, suddenly she appeared from the dark, what should I do? 
[294.28] son, I  can understand that in such situation, this happens. Well, thank God,
[301.12] she did not got hurt much
[307.60] Sorry, you suddenly appeared in front. No, it was my mistake. It
[316.68] was good that you brought us here, if it had been anyone else, he would have run away,
[322.68] Let's go out now, it has been a great deed of God. For Godbiden,
[329.16] if we got hurt too much, what would we have done, son, let's go out.
[334.52] walk slowly
[342.84]  
[350.40] Slowly 
[357.64] Where you will go, I will drop you. Son, we
[365.24] have no place here and anyway we have run away from Lahore,
[372.84] I did not understand. Son, I will not
[379.96] hide anything from you. My daughter is a stage artist.
[385.84] Some bad people wanted to take her and son, I am not a noble woman
[392.88] I lived my whole life by dancing and singing and later taught the same to the girl but
[399.52] I have never sold her and neither will ever do this.
[404.48] You are same as my mother. I will take you to her.
[408.56] She lives alone in the whole house. There is a big place there. Will your mother keep us?
[414.08] Yes, why not Rani Bibi. The truth is that we are also like you.
[420.04] My mother does dancing and singing. She doesn't like selling. That's why
[423.72] she fought with everyone. By staying here, your business will also be successful. 
[426.80] And stage too. No son, not stage
[429.80] Mstage to.  or do anything on the stage, otherwise those people will reach here. Two days ago, they
[434.48] at the house, that's we run away with limited things. Yes, if there is a private
[440.64] gathering, then it will be fine. Oh consider that your work is done,
[448.16] But you have to pay rent to my mother. Right now we don't have money,
[457.16] Don't worry about it, I will give you and you pay my mother. She don't take money from me.
[462.32] Till your work starts, keep taking money from me
[465.76]  and give to mother. Rest, I will explain you in the rickshaw. Come on, let's go.
[471.61] Mother, open the door
[487.00] Mother, I have been knocking for so long, please open the door.
[492.56] Mother,
[497.44] Mother
[501.36] Mother, it's me Whisky. I am coming,
[510.80] What's the matter? I met with an accident. What? Where you got hurt?
[520.16] You got injured? Look, you love me so much, still you don't agree,
[525.00] You are lying to me. I don't lie as much as you think. I swear to Allah,
[530.12]  it was an accident and that too with a girl. She thankfully escaped death and only
[534.04] got hurt on her leg. You are misbehaving. I am joking.
[540.08] Wait a minute. Auntie come here
[544.16] let her come. Come auntie. Asalam alikum. Walikum Asalam. Mother
[552.80] this is Neelam Auntie and this is Rani her daughter. Rani, is a good girl, her mother
[559.52] is also good, both of them will stay at Chanda Auntie, now there will be some activity too.
[566.84] But where did these two come from? Along with the whiskey
[573.32] Whisky? You were saying that the whiskey did not come here at night?
[578.04] Lafra was sitting here from 1 till 2 o'clock in the night. Then when did Whisky bought them?
[582.92] He brought them late. And why are you so jealous? Can't
[588.20] Whiskey talk to any other girl except you?
[592.00] There is nothing to talk about. You are saying that she will live with Chanda Auntie
[598.40]  So what is bothering you? Whisky was talking to Rani very happily. And
[605.20] he also brought breakfast for her. When Mother and I went there, they all
[610.40] were having breakfast together. This whole accident affair seems fake to me.
[614.92] Think for yourself, what if there is an accident, a police case would not have been made.
[620.16] Both the rickshaw and the whiskey would have been in jail. Whatever, but the girl is very beautiful.
[631.64] Hey Zarka, listen to me. Hey Lafrah, make four paan 
[639.92] For whom do you want four paan? For Rani
[648.24] what is the scene? In the
[652.40] morning, you fed them halwa puri. Again  feeding them yourself, what is the scene?
[659.76] You have gone nuts, we have to pour grains to trap them.
[665.72] Damn on your face Vodka
[670.80] You have spoiled my son Guddu's tongue. I am telling you, don't say a word to Vodka.
[676.04] He is my master, and look, to survive you have to serve, if they stay here then my business will run. 
[681.76] [ Song ]
[691.16] [Song]
[702.44] Hey, who are you? Why are you looking at me, I asked who
[708.56] are you? Rani, come on, you have done enough fun, 
[714.16] pick up your luggage and leave. It 's not an orphanage that anyone can come and stay,
[720.00] Leave my hand and Who are you to throw me out of here?
[725.08] I am Whiskey's fiancee and this house is my in-laws' house, it is my right to do whatever I want
[732.20] and throw out whomever I want. Come on, get out.  Why are you doing this?
[739.16] Kicking her out of here. Come on, get out of here.
[742.32] Get quite, what are you saying? I will get this bitch out of the house.
[748.40]  Who are you to kick her out?
[753.20] You slapped me?
[756.40]  In front of her, you slapped me
[762.56] Your fiance? You are not my fiance
[767.56] Forget about this. I have never accepted this engagement, nor will I ever accept it, and
[773.96] what do you think of yourself? Yes, you are taking advantage of my decency. Leave this,  keep quiet.
[778.44] You are doing this because of her?
[783.12] If I don't get you out of here, then I am not my father's child. Come on, get out of here.
[788.92] Anyway, you don't have a father.
[792.92] You are not doing good Whisky. I know what  is good and what is bad,
[798.64] don't let my mind wander, just go away
[807.84] What has happened to you, you have gone mad? She is mad, I have no relation
[813.72] with her, she talks nonsense. She is not capable that I should marry her? But she
[820.32] says that she is your fiancee? I do not consider her as my fiancee.
[825.16] There was my aunt, Zeenat Amaan, she died, when I was six-seven years old, I
[830.96] was a small child and had no intelligence. She was dying and for her happiness, fix
[835.64] my engagement with her. Look,
[840.44] whatever it is, she should not come like this and thrown you out. She has no right.
[845.32] You sit here and I will see who throws you out. Have a paan. You sure, she will not
[850.68] fight me. No, she won't. You sit.
[862.28] I want to kill that scoundrel. Whiskey is right, what was the need
[869.84] for you to go there and throw her out? You don't know, 
[875.88] she has negative vibes. By the way, it's my right. Look, you don't have any rights, you
[883.64] are not married to him. A person's honour is  in his own hands
[888.00] Same thing if you had explained to Whiskey comfortably, then maybe he would have understood what you were saying
[893.44] and would have thrown that Rani out of the house. 
[899.76] I will slap you if talked nonsense. You don't know that Whiskey
[905.92] insulted me in front of her and you are talking nonsense? Why are you fighting Zarka?
[912.68] Mother, Whiskey hit me in front of that wretched Rani
[918.24] and says I am not your fianc√© and I don't believes in engagement. He
[926.04] has lost his mind. Mother, it's Zarka's fault. Chanda Aunty has kept Rani
[932.20] what was the need to go there and push her out. Mother, I just
[938.68] went to her and I said why have you come here, then Whisky slapped me so hard.
[945.12] And he says that you are not my fiancee. I will ask whiskey,
[951.84] relationships are not game, you can break or connect them whenever you want,
[958.04] I will ask him
