Hey, what happened to you, have you been possessed by a ghost again? Aunty, whatever happens, I have decided that I will not dance anymore, I have accumulated a lot, I have exhausted myself, I have enough to feed Guddu and myself. I will not be a burden on anyone. Every six months or a year, someone or the other runs into you. You know we have no survival without dancing and anyway, Whiskey sees you dancing and does not see anyone going in and out of your room. The market knows that you only dance and do nothing else. If you stop dancing, what will you do if you get drunk tomorrow? You understand Guddu, he is intelligent, he will understand. What do you think, he will never know that you are doing Tawaf and Jab Bada. If this happens then he will also come to know what a courtesan does, he will never believe it Chanda, when you will tell him that you have never been sold, yes and if tomorrow he asks you who is his father, what answer will you give, you will get into trouble in school. His name is written instead of his father, he thinks that Lafda is his father. Yes, he is all right, he is a child, that's why when he grows up, he will also come to know that Lafda is not his father, then what will you tell after seeing him, Chanda, the child of the fish, water. I can grow only if I take it out, then it will die, it is your choice, whatever you want to tell, tell me, I understand, I don't understand, what happens in a few days, Oye, take it out, take it out, when did I gamble? So I was playing cards, brother, you bastard, you are refusing, I am not refusing, I will give you money, I die for money, one is spoiling me, on top of that he also asks for money, Oye, I am spoiling you, come here, leave me, my child. I am there, oh you are left, oh you sell the elders and eat them oh she blinked looking at them, look quickly where are you going, you tell Amma, it is useless for me to gamble, oh come here oh run away [praise] I am spoiled, I am born spoiled. He blames me, he also won, if you are born in Jawadi, then come everyone, come come, no brother, no brother, I have brought the bull, come, keep the honor, yes, it is the master's man, yes, I will bring Zeenat now, just a minute, money. So give it, Hi sir, I have sent the money to Adva. Hey sir, what was the need for it? It is very heavy, otherwise you have caused me a lot of trouble, you sit, I will send you right now, don't worry, ask for some tea and water, take the scene quickly, I will take it. Come quickly and this is a very amazing thing sir, if you see it then you will do it. Hey Zeenat, what is this, she is sleeping here, Ijaaz Batna has sent a man over there, Amma, I am not feeling well, I don't feel like going anywhere. Hey Zeenat, don't do this amazing thing. 5 Saheb has sent me for Haj, Amma, I don't have the courage, hey, take some courage, I will come with you, what will happen if you go, I don't have the courage to dance at all, Amma, my whole body is hurting, then tell Chanda. Should I go ? Hey, when will Chanda agree, then it is better to ask. I will talk. Eat the bag and see what has come. Oh yes, it is not much. Oh, it is a very good bag. I get it from India. Do you need anything else, some bottle, some food, some prayer? No, no, it's okay, someone can do something amazing for us , Fafre Nat's health is very bad, she won't be able to go, what are you talking about, I heard brother, you sang with such difficulty, above, I mean, she is having a tantrum after eating the food, it is not a tantrum. I had prepared her but she is not able to get up from the bed, she is very ill, what else should I do, convince Chanda by doing this, she will go away, see today, I heard brother, do not take Chanda's name, she will not dance much with Zeenat. It was discussed that send her, she can't go, you tell Chanda, oh, I can't make Chanda, I do wonders, you send it to Zeenat, you, oh what's the matter, Bhai Saheb had told me to come quickly, O Saheb, is Zeenat's health fine? No, Husna Bhai, please return the money. Oh, what kind of method are you talking about? My mother has kept the entire program as a punishment. The whole program will be spoiled. You guys are speaking dumbly. No sir, it is not like that, the girl's health is very bad. She can't get up from the bed, or your money, I don't want the money back, I will not spoil the friendship of sir, make some other arrangement for me, you will have other girls too, so do this so that you prepare Chambli, she will go away or she will also get the money. Give it, okay, let's go, let me show you Jasmine, how is Jasmine? Come, come, come, come, I have seen the name of Jasmine, its fragrance is also the same. [ Music] I have done my school work, yes, I have done it, I said to Lafda that I am with you. You will go to school and explain to your teacher that you were ill, that is why you did not come to school. No Ma, I will tell you myself that my grandmother was dead. You are talking nonsense. If you lie then Lafda will also lie. I was unwell, ok shut up. Keep your notebooks and go to sleep. Now close your eyes and lie down. You know Guddu, I want you to study and become a great man. When you grow up, we will not stay here, we will go somewhere else, to a nice place, to a very nice home. I will marry you mother, I will marry Jarka and she is very good, no Guddu, not Jarka, I will marry you in a noble family, I don't want to marry a rich family, I will only marry Jarka, you know she dances very well. I will marry her, I will get a lot of money, then nonsense, how many times have you told me not to do such things and this school thing you keep roaming around, I don't like it at all, I come straight home from school and stay locked in the room now. Lie down and see, Guddu, you will not understand the things I say today, but when you grow up, you will understand everything, son, respect is a big thing, a person should live with respect, this dancing and singing is not a good thing, I want when You will grow up, stand on your own feet, yes, it is okay to raise your wife and children with your earnings, okay Amma, when I grow up, I will run the protection like Vatka. You know that Vatka is taking protection. Oh, you did not tell me, yes, you told me. In a few days, his protection will come. He was saying that he will bring his children under the protection of his son. When I grow up, I will also take protection, then after bringing a cow for you, again you talked nonsense, I was talking about work, okay. Just close your eyes, gold kiss, how did you say, how did you take his name, I heard you asking, brother, do you even know that I get turned on by this, not by this, we respect you so much, the stem of your zero in front of the song talks to me. And I mean, how did you take Chanda's name? Hey, look, listen to me, if Zeenat was unwell, I took Chanda's name, then what trouble has come, what sky has fallen down, yes yes, the sky has fallen, Usna Bhai. I explained to you a thousand times that Chada will not dance, it will never happen, there will not be even doomsday, she will not go to that bad man's house and do anything for the rest of her life. Hey, have you gone crazy, what is happening, why are you making so much noise, you are talking strange. She is a good girl, you tell me what to say, hey, what can you tell, I will tell you, look, Chanda, Ijaz Bhatt had sent a man to her house, he had paid full 5000 rupees, he gave full 5000, Zeenat was unwell, so I said, go away, Janda, she went on like this for a long time. If you will go, then you keep quiet, then what trouble will happen if Chanda goes, look Chanda, we have done 100 things for you, we have supported you in your bad times, so if today is our bad time, then you will not support us, are you right? Aunty, you have done me a great favor, you can make me serve you as you wish, I will serve Zeenat too, I will wash the utensils, you can get me to do whatever you want, but I have already said that I will not dance, this woman has spoiled the whole work, you rude person. You do it, I have to suffer, or why was I taking your name to dance, I his life is his and mine is my matter, I would have taken care of it, so don't be angry with me, I do everything for you [Music] Abe Fariyaal, you dance. Show me, show us right now, friend, tomorrow I will bring a ghungroo or I will show it again, I am a very good breakfast wearing a ghungroo, today show me without a ghungroo, okay come on teacher, come teacher ala walekum assalaam, sit down all Shahriyar, what was happening, this or that. No, that's me, take out your copy, you come here to study or to create a ruckus, bring the work given by me yesterday, all of you also take out your copy [Music] What is this, I am asking, what is this, you also did the household work. No, you don't feel like studying at all, and I have told you so many times that you should call your mother and you will not get any household work until you meet your mother again. Go and sit down. All of you also take out the Urdu book and take out the lesson. Say as the elders believe, parents and teachers are all God's mercy. What is this? Who has done this act? I am asking who has done this? Forgive me, teacher. You are standing behind me holding your ears. Go and you have a holiday today, stand up holding your ears, parents and teachers, parents and teachers, everything is God's mercy, God's mercy is there in everything, read it once more Ma [praise] Where is the scene Doctorni sir, some tests are being done on him There are some tests left, her report is not good, Zeenat has AIDS [Music]
