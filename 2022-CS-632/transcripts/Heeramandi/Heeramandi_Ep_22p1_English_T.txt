[8.80] Now tell me what should I do, I had explained all this to her, even
[15.04] Zara aunty had tried to make her understand but at that time she did not listen to anyone
[19.84] Everyone has tried to make her understand but the issue is that Murad she is very afraid of divorce,
[28.96] this is the reason she is doing these stupid things. 
[33.80] Murad, why don't you make your parents understand that 
[36.16] it is not in our hands to have children. 
[40.16] If she had not been afraid of divorce,  
[45.12] she would never have taken such a big risk. I have already told her that
[52.80] I will never divorce her and I look so crazy to you
[57.96] that I would take this step just because my parents are saying?
[62.52] Despite knowing all this, Shumail crucified me.
[70.00] What does she want now? What can she want? A wife under her own roof
[78.36] do not want to see her husband's other wife. Then why did she do all this?
[83.08] Why did she make a show of me? Just to ensure that she does not get divorced, she
[87.44] has fulfilled her wish. You have no idea what is happening to me. She put restrictions on my
[93.28] movement in the house, on my coming and going, on eating and drinking.
[98.56] What is the meaning of all these things? Look Murad,
[104.72] I myself not able to understand what she wants
[108.68] and what you should do?
[113.08] but whatever you do, do it thoughtfully.
[124.08] So what do you say, what should I do now?
[130.64] It is better if you don't ask me because I am very confused myself,
[137.76] rather you ask yourself what do you want?
[146.95] [Music]
[166.56] Why have you come here? Asalam alikum  Madam. I have come to meet Zarka.
[173.80] She won't meet anyone. Why won't she meet?
[180.84] Because I don't want to. There was a clear discussion with her mother that neither will she meet anyone nor
[185.88] will anyone come to meet her. Then why have you come here? Look, this was not discussed. I
[191.08] did not talk to you. It is better that you leave from here. I
[196.84] will not leave without meeting Zarka.
[201.28] Zarka is not allowing us to meet. Tell him to get away from here, otherwise I
[206.52] will throw you out along with him. How will you throw me out like this? If there was a deal and then
[211.48] you will have to pay the full amount. Why have you come?
[215.08] Go away from here. Zarka, you don't need to be afraid of them. Stop talking nonsense,
[221.76] go away. Get out of here, otherwise you will get pushed out by the servants
[227.40] Okay Madam, I will not come again.
[231.92] Give me number of auntie with whom the deal was made. Get out of here and don't dare to come here again.
[236.84] Understand? Go!
[243.68] What is this all? This is not your in-laws house where your family members
[248.76] will come to meet you whenever they feel like it. Say to them, don't step in this house again 
[254.04] Otherwise I will throw you out. Your marriage with Murad is our compulsion. You
[259.44] have not been married, you have been bought. Never forget this
[287.68] Why have you come here? I have come to talk to you!
[292.28] What do you want to talk to me? This is the deal with you that we did not
[296.96] handed over Zarka to you forever. When Hema auntie went to take her, that lady did not send her and
[302.08] when I went, she did not allow me to meet her. I had forbidden her to go, this deal was done with me.
[307.00] and it was decided that she would not go back after she came here,
[311.68] Don't talk nonsense, yes, we had sold Zarka, not buried, you guys
[317.80] are not owning your words, you come with me and send her with me. I will drop her in the evening,
[323.16] Go from here otherwise it will be very wrong. What will go wrong? Don't threaten me,
[330.40] What happened? What are you saying? You stay out of this matter sir.
[335.44] we had deal with madam. Are you in your senses, this is a house of noble people not prostitution area.
[343.76] Prostitution areas are also lighted by people like you, Sir, prostitute fulfils your needs, 
[349.64] they are useful for your barren women. Shut Up!
[353.96] Out!
[363.56] [Music]
[377.48]  
[381.48] Hi Zaraka, I was thinking about you, you have a long life. Whiskey came there?
[388.08] are you coming? Don't talk nonsense, that wretched person came here, I am not coming.
[395.84] I want to talk to mother. Okay, Mother, Zarka is on the phone. Oh Zarka, I am coming, tell me what happened, so
[403.96] why you want to talk to mother? 
[408.20] Give me the phone. Hello
[415.20] Why did Whisky come here? Why did you send him here?
[420.52] If you did not send him, then why did he come here, why do you people want to make my life miserable,
[425.60] I did not send anyone there. I warned,
[431.68] Whiskey not to step there. Zarka dear, you should apologise to Shumail,
[438.28] tell her that now no one from this house will come there, I will take notice of Whiskey,
[443.64] if those people say, then we too will not come to meet you,
[450.24] it's okay, don't worry,
[455.00] Khuda Hafiz
[465.35] [Music]
[469.48] He will not leave my daughter, he will destroy her house
[476.48] [Music]
[485.92] You come with me Lafray, I will put that  bastard in jail in the kidnapping case.
[489.80] Who has been kidnapped, what case?
[494.84] In Zarka's case, who else. Have you gone mad, go from here, you yourself have done it,
[501.48] Hey, who says on which paper it is written? Which stamp paper I signed? I
[506.32] am telling you. There is no paper of law, today I will report, tomorrow everyone will be in jail.
[510.92] Hey Guddu, don't talk non sense. It's not non sense.
[517.44] a fire inside me. I will not leave him, he slapped me here. I will not spare him. What is his name? He is some
[523.68] relative of Murad. Lady who came here to finalise the deal, he is her husband.
[534.36] Hey Guddu,
[536.80] I am not well. Hey, buy a drink for Guddu,
[544.64] I don't want anything. Leave this. Spit it out my dear, oh what happened,
[551.60] Don't touch me. He hit me here, I will not leave him, I am telling you. Hey dear, leave this all 
[558.32] They are rich people, if he hit you then it doesn't matter. I will hit that bastard very hard.
[565.16] Hey Guddu, you are scaring me, what has happened to you?
[571.04] This is the result of your sympathy, I told you that all this will
[575.64] happen, all good and bad will fall on your neck, those people to whom God does not
[581.52] give troubles, they themselves buy troubles and you have crossed the limits,
[586.32] that you reached the brothel, even a man can't imagine ...
[598.10] You loved Shumail a lot?
[602.80] You have done enough for her, now tell her that I
[606.56] will not tolerate her stupidity, and solve her house matters by herself.
[610.56] Murad is also fed up. He came to me, he is not a stupid man. Although
[618.76] he did not say anything to me, but he must be definitely putting all the blame on you,
[622.64] enough is enough. Let's end this all here. That's it!
[631.91] [Music] 
[645.36] [Music]
[651.96] Look Lafray, my mind is not in control, I will do whatever my heart desires,
[656.20] don't try to make me understand. Where are you taking me? Shut up and sit in the rickshaw,
[661.04] Just listen to me, you will fight there? I will not fight, I will beat the bastard 
[667.04] I will hit him hard. You have gone crazy. Sit in Rickshaw 
[670.84] Be gentle, dear. Don't be so angry, just get relax
[677.20] look listen to me, don't do like this. 
[681.48] Oh how do I know, I didn't even listen to him. I was coming out of the room there were noisy sounds
[687.96] then he went away, started his rickshaw, took Lafrah and went out.
[692.88] Amma told this to me. Mother abused Whiskey for going to Zarka's house
[697.68] and he also argue said but if he takes Lafrah to Zarka's house 
[703.48] He didn't do well. Now who knows where he has gone, what
[709.64] will he do? And you know Chanda Aunty is worried about him.
[714.40] Leave it, God will make everything fine, I have brought cloth for the new suit and I will show it to you,
[720.80] You sit, I am coming. A new dress? Baji, I apologize to you.
[728.56] I promise that no one will come in the future, Baji, whatever it is, it
[733.96] is not even my fault. It is your fault, you should have refused everyone when
[738.52] There was a discussion with your mother that no one will come here, so he reached here,
[742.08] after that he reached aunty's house? I had told him in front of you that he should go away,
[747.88] Okay, go to your room now, now you have refused. At that very moment I
[754.84] had called mother and told her that no one should come here. Yes, it's okay, now go,
[758.96] don't stand here and take care next time. You saw
[768.56] within four-five days so many troubles have arise. Yes, I can see how many troubles
[775.04] you have faced and I can also see how much loss you have caused in these five days, the
[779.20] loss of money, the fight with Murad, Sheram also scold me.
[784.32] and the tension that you yourself have raised,
[787.12] You did all this just to see this day? I have accepted my mistake, please tell Murad
[793.08] to end this story, divorce her and send her back.
[797.60] How many days have passed since this marriage? Four days, right? And during these four days Murad has also met her,
[805.20] I am not able to tolerate this, I have spent four days on the cross
[810.64] and you think that giving divorce is so easy? Imagine if
[816.00] she has become pregnant in these four days then? So quickly?
[821.04] You can find within 48 hours. Take her to a doctor and get her tested you will come to know.
[826.84]  
[830.88] And the fight between that the boy and Shehram don't tell Murad about this. Shehram
[837.24] was saying that he was already very upset that and this can make him more angry.
[842.88] I swear I won't tell.
[848.52] I swear I was feeling scared in the rickshaw, I prayed for only one thing all the way, that we don't meet him
[855.12] All life God has not listened to me, today he listened to me for the first time.
[859.92] You too are crazy, why you went with him. He forcibly took me with him
[868.20] By the way listen to me, you make him understand because if not today then tomorrow he will
[875.76] found that guy, then what will happen? He should cool down his anger, whatever is happening is
[881.00] his own doing and put one thing in his mind that Hema wants
[887.96] Zarka to stay there and happy. What do you think, I
[894.72] must not have tried to explain but he is mad with anger.
[899.56] Listen to me, why are you getting worried, don't worry, I will take care of him.
[906.88] Where he is now? He is downstairs, walking in anger.
[913.99] [music]
[968.76] Why did she turn off her phone?
