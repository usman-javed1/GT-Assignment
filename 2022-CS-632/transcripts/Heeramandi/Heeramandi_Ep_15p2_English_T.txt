[6.24] I am getting engaged
[8.24] I am getting engaged
[11.08] Hey Phoolan, I'm getting engaged. What nonsense are
[19.24] you talking? It's not nonsense? First I'll get engaged, then I'll get married.
[24.80] You must have put yourself in Vodka's place, and thinking to marry Zeenat?
[32.12] You are such a stupid man, Zeenat is Vodka's wife, I am getting married to Zarqa,
[38.12] Haven't you gone? I am not mad. Go to my mother
[44.36] she will feed you sweets. Engagement is today. I am leaving
[51.24] Phoolan Baba, how are you? I am fine.
[58.08] Have they all gone mad? Everyone getting married,
[65.52] my business is over. Congratulations
[71.56] [Song]
[82.20] [Song]
[90.00] Oh my prince, Congratulations. Take sweets
[97.84] Open your mouth, eat properly. That's good. Have some sweet Husna Auntie
[107.72]  
[116.84] Take some. 
[124.16] Come here, you also take some
[131.80] Show some dance
[155.76] Vodka, I am very happy today.
[162.16] I feel as
[169.16] from my heart
[173.48] all burden is washed away.
[182.16] I will leave this world
[185.36] with many sins,
[190.12] but when mother promised me 
[198.00] that she would never do anything wrong
[205.10]  then my heart
[213.84] felt relax 
[220.88] and when Chanda and Hema
[229.28] agreed for Whisky and Zarqa's wedding,
[235.76] I felt that I had paid for my all sins
[241.07] Today I have got everything,
[248.44] I have got everything, your dreams has also been fulfilled
[255.12] and mine too
[260.50] Hey, Zeenat
[266.28] marrying me was your dream too?
[273.24] Always ... I use to tease you. I was scared of mother.
[279.93]  
[284.80] It's every woman dream
[290.33] that she should belong to only one person
[301.08] and that one person belongs to her only.
[307.02] she make family with him and
[312.36] make his house a paradise 
[318.40] I just want that
[323.96] I wish I could say this to every courtesan
[330.19] that don't do this work
[336.16] for the sake for your bread and butter
[341.76] Non of the woman has to do
[348.16] this work for the sake of her living.
[355.00] It becomes a big torture
[360.44] They suffer in this world
[367.03] and in the hell also.
[374.05] Here hell too
[379.32] and there hell too 
[384.44] Look at me
[390.00] when I will die. Oh no dear you will not die. I
[396.36] am getting your treatment, I have prayed a lot for you.
[400.36] I have prayed a lot and I have ask for forgiveness from God
[405.16] and it is not all your fault, dear
[410.92] What is your fault? We ourselves have instigated you to commit crimes
[417.80] and if the customers do not come here, then such areas will
[423.68] not exist. Man comes, that's why women commit crimes
[429.50]  I think that why do these respectable people
[437.20] leave their respectable wives at home and come here to get? What do
[443.72] they get, what do they leave behind?
[448.04] Sins, sorrows, diseases and
[451.64]  people like me.
[456.24] Punishment for this,
[460.48] we deal with big losses, dear and
[466.60] this is neither any benefit to them nor any
[471.20] benefit to us, just we carry the burden of our sins all our life
[475.44] and we just keep on moving like this and one day, everything ends.
[481.96] Everyone has to die friend, one day everyone will leave the world.
[488.48] But I will not let you die.
[496.04] I have prayed a lot for you dear, If you die, I won't survive either,
[501.52]  how can I stay alive without  you. You can't die ...
[513.04] Zeenat?
[527.21]  
[545.20] You must be tired
[551.40] We had fun filled day. You must be tired now. Take some rest
[561.60] We have to go out also, Lafrah has invited for dinner in hotel
[567.16] Take rest
[572.84] Have make preparation to go to Lahore also, Will visit shrine there, will pray there.
[581.04] I had asked for a wish. 
[586.40] You take some rest
[590.88] We will go for honeymoon.
[595.77] Murree. We will roam on mall road
[600.96] We will not live here, we will go far away, we will eat buy a nice home there,
[610.28] You will not do any work, you will just cook roti's, my rickshaw will come, than I will
[619.12] drive the rickshaw
[622.20] We will go to Sea View. You
[626.64] must be tired, take some rest
[633.38] You will be fine
[637.64] You will be treated
[642.84] You will be fine
[648.36] Take some rest
[654.40] You will be fine. Take some rest
[661.20] You must be tired
[662.68] Is it good? Try yourself.
[667.68] It is bitter, you did not told me I have to add sugar in it. I was waiting for this time,
[674.24]  
[677.20] it's still bitter.
[680.76] It is strong for me
[695.79]  
[702.08] Will you be able to spend your life with me? Have you ever looked at me carefully?
[708.80] In the last few years, I have grown even more.
[714.60] Perhaps there is no more life left in me like
[720.88] it is in you.
[724.04] You are insisting to marry? Have you thought
[729.64] how far will Zaira be able to run with you? What if you
[736.48] move ahead and
[739.40] I will remain standing behind, neither will I be able to call you nor
[746.80] will I be able to run to you
[751.86]  
[756.84] 15 years ago, when I saw you for the first time,
[761.76] exactly You look
[766.32] exactly like you look today. I
[774.48] have been searching for this Zaira for so many years
[781.59] [Music]
[787.47] [Music]
[794.72] Coffee...
[802.24] Shall I order more?
[806.16] Are you sure? Now enough
[813.09]  
[817.24] Oh my dear, My son
[826.24] What happened Vodka? Oh my dear, you accept that she is dead, Zeenat is dead,
[835.60] we all have to die, who
[841.32] remains alive till the doomsday. But before leaving, she has improved everyone. 
[848.04] Vodka, Zeenat has paid for all sins
[854.68] Hey Vodka, 
[860.08] Are you listening to us or not? Your wife is dead. 
[871.00] She loved you very much. When a person, who loves you most goes away
[878.72] a man should cry.
[882.52] Cry my dear. One cannot go with the person who is dying.
[893.20] This is how the world works. Cry my dear
[899.56] He has gone mad, why are you not crying? What are you doing Lafrah
[907.00] What should I do? Why he is not listening. Say something Vodka. You will kill me and than speak?
[916.36] Cry my dear, Oh my dear
[923.36] Hey my Vodka, Cry my dear
[929.12] listen to me my brother, Cry Vodka
[939.64] Cry, Cry
[946.96] Hey Vodka
