[Music]  Why you have come here? I have come to see you You want to see when I will die? Mother Why do you talk like this?  Who told you that I bring girls from Hyderabad? I swear, whoever is saying is lying. You are telling lies, You think, I am blind and deaf, I can't see or hear anything? The customers brought by you come to my door looking for you, through them I come to know about your work. Why did I give you Rickshaw? Can't you stop bringing these customers? I will leave Hema Aunty, Zarka, Pari will dye of hunger, should I see them dying? I don't send you that earning which is given by customers, whatever I earn from the rickshaw, I keep that amount separate. I swear by Allah, I send only that and you returns it. I don't want your earnings. How much I wanted you to get educated. If you had been working as a clerk somewhere, we would be living peacefully. You would have been eating respectfully. Vodka has spoiled you. Mother, don't say anything to him I chose this work myself. You abuses me, that's enough for me [Music] This money is my rickshaw earnings I know, You have never had forbidden and I have sworn that I will never feed you [Music]   I want a girl who can be my partner in the dance party.

Sir, you had asked for the party, I will deliver, Think about it, it is a police case. Although, they did not get any deep wounds, if you say. No we don't want to file any case against him, you just bandage the girl quickly, we have to go. I have bandaged. I am sending her. Thank you doctor Thank you Auntie. It was not my fault, suddenly she appeared from the dark, what should I do?  son, I  can understand that in such situation, this happens. Well, thank God, she did not got hurt much Sorry, you suddenly appeared in front. No, it was my mistake. It was good that you brought us here, if it had been anyone else, he would have run away, Let's go out now, it has been a great deed of God. For Godbiden, if we got hurt too much, what would we have done, son, let's go out. walk slowly   Slowly  Where you will go, I will drop you. Son, we have no place here and anyway we have run away from Lahore, I did not understand. Son, I will not hide anything from you. My daughter is a stage artist. Some bad people wanted to take her and son, I am not a noble woman I lived my whole life by dancing and singing and later taught the same to the girl but I have never sold her and neither will ever do this. You are same as my mother. I will take you to her. She lives alone in the whole house. There is a big place there. Will your mother keep us? Yes, why not Rani Bibi. The truth is that we are also like you. My mother does dancing and singing. She doesn't like selling. That's why she fought with everyone. By staying here, your business will also be successful.  And stage too. No son, not stage Mstage to.  or do anything on the stage, otherwise those people will reach here. Two days ago, they at the house, that's we run away with limited things. Yes, if there is a private gathering, then it will be fine. Oh consider that your work is done, But you have to pay rent to my mother. Right now we don't have money, Don't worry about it, I will give you and you pay my mother. She don't take money from me. Till your work starts, keep taking money from me  and give to mother. Rest, I will explain you in the rickshaw. Come on, let's go. Mother, open the door Mother, I have been knocking for so long, please open the door. Mother, Mother Mother, it's me Whisky. I am coming, What's the matter? I met with an accident. What? Where you got hurt? You got injured? Look, you love me so much, still you don't agree, You are lying to me. I don't lie as much as you think. I swear to Allah,  it was an accident and that too with a girl. She thankfully escaped death and only got hurt on her leg. You are misbehaving. I am joking. Wait a minute. Auntie come here let her come. Come auntie. Asalam alikum. Walikum Asalam. Mother this is Neelam Auntie and this is Rani her daughter. Rani, is a good girl, her mother is also good, both of them will stay at Chanda Auntie, now there will be some activity too. But where did these two come from? Along with the whiskey Whisky? You were saying that the whiskey did not come here at night? Lafra was sitting here from 1 till 2 o'clock in the night. Then when did Whisky bought them? He brought them late. And why are you so jealous? Can't Whiskey talk to any other girl except you? There is nothing to talk about. You are saying that she will live with Chanda Auntie  So what is bothering you? Whisky was talking to Rani very happily. And he also brought breakfast for her. When Mother and I went there, they all were having breakfast together. This whole accident affair seems fake to me. Think for yourself, what if there is an accident, a police case would not have been made. Both the rickshaw and the whiskey would have been in jail. Whatever, but the girl is very beautiful. Hey Zarka, listen to me. Hey Lafrah, make four paan  For whom do you want four paan? For Rani what is the scene? In the morning, you fed them halwa puri. Again  feeding them yourself, what is the scene? You have gone nuts, we have to pour grains to trap them. Damn on your face Vodka You have spoiled my son Guddu's tongue. I am telling you, don't say a word to Vodka. He is my master, and look, to survive you have to serve, if they stay here then my business will run.  [ Song ] [Song] Hey, who are you? Why are you looking at me, I asked who are you? Rani, come on, you have done enough fun,  pick up your luggage and leave. It 's not an orphanage that anyone can come and stay, Leave my hand and Who are you to throw me out of here? I am Whiskey's fiancee and this house is my in-laws' house, it is my right to do whatever I want and throw out whomever I want. Come on, get out.  Why are you doing this? Kicking her out of here. Come on, get out of here. Get quite, what are you saying? I will get this bitch out of the house.  Who are you to kick her out? You slapped me?  In front of her, you slapped me Your fiance? You are not my fiance Forget about this. I have never accepted this engagement, nor will I ever accept it, and what do you think of yourself? Yes, you are taking advantage of my decency. Leave this,  keep quiet. You are doing this because of her? If I don't get you out of here, then I am not my father's child. Come on, get out of here. Anyway, you don't have a father. You are not doing good Whisky. I know what  is good and what is bad, don't let my mind wander, just go away What has happened to you, you have gone mad? She is mad, I have no relation with her, she talks nonsense. She is not capable that I should marry her? But she says that she is your fiancee? I do not consider her as my fiancee. There was my aunt, Zeenat Amaan, she died, when I was six-seven years old, I was a small child and had no intelligence. She was dying and for her happiness, fix my engagement with her. Look, whatever it is, she should not come like this and thrown you out. She has no right. You sit here and I will see who throws you out. Have a paan. You sure, she will not fight me. No, she won't. You sit. I want to kill that scoundrel. Whiskey is right, what was the need for you to go there and throw her out? You don't know,  she has negative vibes. By the way, it's my right. Look, you don't have any rights, you are not married to him. A person's honour is  in his own hands Same thing if you had explained to Whiskey comfortably, then maybe he would have understood what you were saying and would have thrown that Rani out of the house.  I will slap you if talked nonsense. You don't know that Whiskey insulted me in front of her and you are talking nonsense? Why are you fighting Zarka? Mother, Whiskey hit me in front of that wretched Rani and says I am not your fianc√© and I don't believes in engagement. He has lost his mind. Mother, it's Zarka's fault. Chanda Aunty has kept Rani what was the need to go there and push her out. Mother, I just went to her and I said why have you come here, then Whisky slapped me so hard. And he says that you are not my fiancee. I will ask whiskey, relationships are not game, you can break or connect them whenever you want, I will ask him
