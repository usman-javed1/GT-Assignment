[29.16] will lock me up in the police station, no, I will not let you people be locked up, I will not let you guys be locked up,
[33.80] what do you think, we will let you all locked up, you would have mouthed off,
[38.48] why was there a need to raise your hand, you don't know that you were burnt earlier. Aunty, I am not afraid of anyone and
[44.40] tell him that I will give up my life which is beyond his reach and will not
[50.36] let his wishes be fulfilled. I had come with a donation to fulfill his wishes. You yourself have spoiled the work.
[56.28] Amma had told him that your I am not well, yes, so what else did I
[60.44] tell her, Chanda has given birth to a child, she has undergone a major operation, she got 18 stitches, oh

[71.84] is very angry, now I know. No, what else will he do, what will he do to save Dudu, what will he do, will he
[76.84] put us all inside, what else will he do? O she is blind, brother, you are amazing,
[81.80] you are a small one, there are many people on top of her, and I knew that one day he will come all. I have made arrangements
[87.04] , I have heard the name of Seth Imtiyaz, he is his nephew, he is the DSP,
[92.24] I will see, I will see him, you will see, then go, then you keep quiet, you will search for Imtiyaz Dilli and
[97.28] his nephew, and he is a SHO, he will do his work and go away. Okay, you guys are scared,
[103.96] okay, I'll take Chanda and the child, don't worry, go out, now
[108.96] don't chatter, there is no need to let anyone go, let's see what happens, we will
[113.40] all suffer, I will dance, I will dance, I will sing hum. Saiya more, come, I
[120.76] will sing to them, I will sing, I will dance, I will sing, I will sing, I will
[129.08] turn, what is the matter, today Champa is shining very brightly and you must be jealous after seeing me, why would I
[135.28] go, I have never seen you without getting ready, you look like a witch,
[143.00] you are my witch. Have you come here to have fun, not to have fun? You have come for work.
[150.12] Tell me the work and get out of here. This is my place. Brother, I can come here whenever I want and
[155.80] I can sit here. Oye, don't let the pressure of space bother you. This is my place. Hey you. So keep quiet,
[164.80] tell me what is the matter, aunty, give me my embroidery, why will he do it?
[174.52] Just a few months ago, you took all the money from me, spent it all, you even saved some,
[180.20] hey, Amma, he had gone there to see Zeenat's dance. He has squandered all the money. Oh he
[189.04] has gone mad. I have never seen Zeenat's dance before. He squandered all the money, I don't want it now,
[196.28] I don't want to stop depositing it and then I can do whatever I want with you, from where did you get
[205.36] it from me, Guddu. Had to buy things for Guddu? Hey, have you gone mad?
[213.12] I had brought so many things for Guddu and those things, those two rings and two pairs of things.
[220.40] I have seen a car for him. Is he giving it to him with a pizza?
[226.48] Don't be kidding. Nah, for him, it is not the vehicle in which the child learns to walk.
[230.52] What do they call it as a walker, oh fool, oh fool, they call it a walker, not a walker,
[236.36] oh oh friend, and it is not as good for a small child as it is for Guddu when he grows up.
[241.28] He will start walking, bring him, oh when he grows up, take him, friend, from now on he will learn, then
[246.28] he will learn to walk, then he will learn to run, then he will learn to commit every sin, friend, and I
[251.40] have not come to seek advice from you guys, I want it before me, I just said it. Vatka, I
[256.28] don't have money, these little devotees have thrown Hema Malani out of here, she
[261.08] used to give me a good commission, they just fired Hema and where she has gone, who knows that she
[268.28] has settled in the heart of Husna Aunty. What else can you do? And hey man, you just shut up, you have
[274.20] already caused harm to me, it is being said from above, friend, you all pamper me later, first
[279.72] give me my money, I told you that I don't have
[284.24] money, ok then 000 Just give it, oh oh Kambak, I have fallen behind, even if we die of hunger,
[294.12] you take Rs. 000. Don't you know aunty, how much fun it is to give. Go away
[303.44] witch, we will not leave you . You are in the juice of this world like high walls.
[313.52] Nothing is in your control Zeenat, nothing is
[321.80] in my control, what should my heart do when someone falls in love with someone, I don't know when or where,
[333.88] she hasn't come for samosas, hasn't she gone to buy vegetables and you know, when she
[339.80] buys vegetables, she fights for an hour first. And then she reduces the money and then comes with the vegetables.
[344.56] Guddu is asleep, isn't he? Where will I feed him first? Then put him to sleep.
[368.72] Come on, hey, have you brought food already? I haven't come with any food,
[376.48] he is crying, do you have any work? I was just asking,
[385.76] have you gone to the market,
[392.48] do you have any work?

[406.28] What should I talk about? Hey, tell me, what do you want to talk about
[413.60] ? Look, don't talk bluntly to me, and let me tell you one more thing.

[527.36] he considered useless and stupid, has started a big business.
[532.84] I am going to London. Son, whatever he says is for your good.
[540.48] It would have been nice if you had done so much of what you are doing today in front of him. If
[546.40] he had allowed me to do something, he would have looked at me, then I would have done something. Tell me,
[553.32] Zaira is gone, Amma, I told you that she
[557.72] left from here. Amma, why don't you believe me? Tell me the truth.
[565.80] Amma, she has gone from here. She is gone.
[575.08] Amma, well, if you are going to London, then put the house on rent. Amma, what are you talking about
[582.48] ? How can I give the house on rent, so many paintings of Abba, so many statues,
[587.64] I don't know from where he collected everything, anyone else
[592.72] can spoil it, I can't pay the rent and yes, I
[599.48] will lock the house and go to London. I will give you my number, you will call me on that
[604.78] [Music]
[613.36] Ok, you lied, for how long, how long will you keep lying for me?
[619.20] What else would you have
[623.88] done if you had not lied, Baral
[629.60] [Music] Now Amma will not call here
[635.99] [Music]
[639.40] Now if she is yours If she doesn't want to live with me, should I forcefully send her away?
[643.88] Look at her, Husna, you are not playing any trick with me, why do I
[650.32] need to play tricks and it was not I who started this fight, you forbade your girls, you
[655.04] beat that poor girl so much. Ko and you know how helpless Hema is. Oh okay,
[661.24] I know how helpless Hima is, but where are there no fights? Sorry
[666.52] Heera, there is a big difference between fighting and fighting, see, we
[673.20] commit crimes all our life. Sometimes one should do good deeds, isn't it okay, you
[679.60] supported Hema of good deeds, now if she has left you and has come to me,
[683.72] should I forcefully throw her out? Now do you consider her clever or something else, it is your choice,
[689.92] I will tell you this. She had come to say that you understood Hema, now those two girls
[695.36] will not do anything to her. Hey Hema, stop, son, stop, stop, my child, stop and
[701.28] listen to me. Hey, listen, child, I have come to take you,
[709.20] listen to me. Whatever they did to you, I apologize on behalf of both of them. Please
[714.88] forgive me. You have always called me your mother. Now consider me as your mother and accept my words.
[720.80] No, Heera Aunty, I do not want to go there with you. So I can't even think of going,
[726.72] after all I also have some respect, whatever I do, I
[732.72] am doing it to feed my sisters and brothers,
[737.44] not to get myself insulted and in front of you Champa and Babra. What has she done to me?
[742.32] Hey, I know my child. Okay, don't be angry. This is how I do it. I would
[748.24] have called her here and made her apologize to you. Hey, leave it aunty. I don't want to see her
[754.64] face. Hey, listen to me. What kind of unbridled mare you are. This is gone

[872.96] and go.
[879.04] '
[884.84] I wanted to find her, at least I can tell her that she has a son. Hey friend, I know if I
[891.44] still meet her then I will tell her that even if she doesn't take me, take Guddu,
[898.04] Hema. I don't want Guddu to
[901.44] grow up in Tawaf. I want him to grow up in a good family, get educated and
[908.72] become a good man like his father, don't worry about Guddu, Guddu
[916.32] is still very small, for two to four years, he will not even know where he is growing up and with whom he
