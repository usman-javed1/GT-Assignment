[7.00] Let me tell you one thing Shumail
[9.52] I cannot leave Zarka, and I will never leave her.
[16.40] I did not know that you were such a mean, selfish and careless woman.
[24.12] Perhaps Allah showed me all this so that your reality could be visible
[30.04] What is her reality? Courtesan? dancing? singing? She is
[35.92] bought and sold? Murad, wives are not bought and sold. I don't
[41.84] know whether you are telling the truth or a lie because I have never seen brothel nor
[46.68] have I ever seen her dancing. You had told me that she was a courtesan and you
[52.64] had told me that she was an unsellable courtesan .... Enough!
[57.96] I don't want to argue on this topic
[64.96] You will not take the decisions of my life. I will do.
[72.76] I am going to take Zarka.
[84.52] I have decided that I cannot leave Zarka now
[92.00] but because of Shumail's actions I don't know where she has gone. She must have gone to her home
[97.56] and when any girl goes back to the brothel with her own choice, you cannot forcefully keep her
[101.28] She has not gone there willingly and even if she had gone, I
[107.16] would not let her stay there
[110.24] Sir, think for yourself the woman with whom you spent time,
[116.92] you used her, so after using her
[121.36] you will throw her out like this?
[124.28] She has been with me for a long time, and even if I
[131.20] had spent even one night with her, I
[135.32] would not have thought of leaving her. You should not think this way for a courtesan.
[140.76] You had bought that woman. A woman is not a thing to be bought and sold.
[145.20] Woman is just a woman and you and Shumail had told me that
[151.28] no one had even touched her before me, so a woman who does not want to be sold, how she can be courtesan?
[159.36] Murad, now she is gone, and it is better for you to forget her.
[165.16] There are many such meetings in life, mistakes which a person forgets,
[170.44] For God's sake Aunty, she was not my mistake, she was my commitment and you and Shumail
[176.72] forced me to do all this? Circumstances had forced us to do all this, but ... 
[183.36] by the compulsion of circumstances, but is the mental and physical relationship with a woman is so meaningless
[189.00] that a person should forget her? No Aunty,
[194.28] If a person has a relationship with someone, then it is with full heart and soul
[200.88] Every moment spends with her stays inside and I cannot be so selfish
[206.56] to use someone and then throw like this
[210.56] Sir ...
[213.92] I can't stoop so low or indulge in such disgraceful actions.
[218.16] [Music]
[222.40] How will she spend her life?
[228.52] She will never forget the pain of this relationship. What will she do? Have you thought about this?
[236.19] She became my wife. She
[242.76] became the mother of my child
[248.40] The child could not survive is a different matter,
[253.36] but if not, today then tomorrow she will definitely become my child's mother
[260.64] Well, for now go home and take care of Shumail, she is so upset that
[266.12] she can do something. I had received a call and she was crying a lot. 
[270.72] Go and take care of her, Sir, I don't know where Zarka lives
[278.56] but I will bring her back and she will live with me in the same house
[287.24] However, please tell Shumail that now I will not agree to any of her wrong decision.
[295.36]  
[306.96] He is getting emotional, after all, he is a child, he
[310.44] doesn't even know that a courtesan
[314.68] is a courtesan. Shehram?
[350.69]  
[360.89] Hey Guddu ....
[365.76] You have come back, where did you go,
[374.20] my child? Lafray,
[377.84] they took Zarka, they took Zarka
[383.88] Hey, she has come back
[389.72] Zarka is back home. She is back?
[394.56] Hey Guddu ... Listen to me
[403.76] Whatever happened, consider it a dream and forget it, we cannot fight fate, whatever
[415.20] is written by God is final. We can't do
[423.08] anything, we can't do anything. Zarka ... Zarka ... Zarka ....
[432.20] I went to the hospital to take you, it is good that you have come yourself, I had thought
[439.16] that they had taken you, it is their father's jurisdiction that they would have taken you, now I will marry you,
[444.80] I swear to Allah, I will do whatever you say, now I will break a star from the sky and
[449.20] bring it for you. Why have you come here, you have ruined my daughter's life,
[456.68] now you will break the stars and bring? For whom?
[464.12] For this stone statue?
[469.40] This Zarka aunty, she is not a stone statue,
[475.84] Zarka, you are listening to me, tell everyone, tell everyone that you
[482.88] have come back because of me, and see, people have only money to give,
[488.56] to courtesan, no respect. Be thankful, your child also died,
[495.04] otherwise, these bastards would have snatched your child from you. Get up,
[500.96] get out of here, get out of here, you bastard, you have cursed my daughter
[510.04] She is ruined because of you, I am saying, Aunty, don't mess with me. Zarka was mine.
[516.08] Zarka Open the door; Zarka Open the door. Zarka, you are my fiancé.
[524.56] Now you remember that she is your fiancée. Hey, you had sold her considering her courtesan and
[530.88] your mother who gives lesson of decency did not tell you this that a woman is not sold
[537.36] only courtesan is sold, get lost from here, you filthy sewer worm
[544.28] Move from here. Zarka open the door. She is dead for you. Get out of here and if
[552.52] you don't go then I will kill you.
[558.56] Look, I beg you, have mercy on me. Zarka is mine, I will marry her. I
[564.64] swear I will keep her happy. Don't take my Zarka from me, I beg you.
[569.88] You have already ruined her life, what else do you want? Get out
[575.32] of here, mother call the police. Get out of here. I will not go!
[588.74] [music]
[608.60] Mother, Zarka is mine?
[613.36] She is mine.
[617.88] Zarka belongs to no one.
[627.12] Mother,
[632.88] I am a filthy sewer worm?
[642.16] I am a bastard
[647.96] I have no right to live.
[653.64] Why you give birth to me?
[662.48] If by mistake I was born
[666.32] you should have killed me soon after my birth. No, my child ...
[675.12] You should have put me in the garbage, dogs can pick me up
[681.18] I ....
[685.08] Then I wouldn't be called a bastard.
[691.77] Then I wouldn't witness this sorrow
[698.48] If I can't get anyone's love
[704.48] then why you kept me alive?
[711.84] On this brothel, where there is no 
 respects nor relations
[720.44] Here everyone is for sold mother, no one loves anyone, all
[726.16] are for sold. No my child
[730.20] I am your mother, this is not a relation?
[737.16] My son, this is my house, others call it a brothel,
[746.20] here is respect and relationship too, you are my child, my legitimate child
[757.24] I have given you birth knowingly. Illegitimate are those whose mother
[763.40] does not want to give birth to them and they are born, you are my son
[768.96] you are my child, my dear
[775.60] I never got sold
[779.96] I have never been with anyone; I am only your mother.
[787.12] only your mother.
[792.40] Mother, I have never
[797.92] received anyone's love. Don't say like this, I love
[805.08] you very much. I cradled you to sleep on my chest, son.
[813.40] You all are liars, no one loves me, everyone hates me, everyone hates me
[822.00] Hey Guddu, look here, look at me, do I hate you?
[831.70] I didn't bring you up like a child,
[837.56] I didn't make you sleep on my chest
[844.12] I ride you on my shoulders, your mother hates you? she
[851.96] loves you, crazy!
[858.56] My dear, you are legitimate child. I know your father, I know.
[868.64] No Habib. Oh, shut up, let me tell him, Habib, you had sworn. Shut up,
[875.00] let me tell, or he will go mad. You have father, I will take you to him.
[884.04] No child is illegitimate, his father is illegitimate, oh my prince
[892.24] I will take you to your father. Come, I will take you. Guddu, come my dear
[900.80] Guddu ... don't leave me, Guddu, stop. Guddu
[908.92] Guddu, don't leave me. Guddu, don't go. Leave me, I
[913.08] will die 
[920.00] I was alive only for you, son.
[927.09] [Music]
[933.68] It's all your fault, you never told him
[940.04] how much I love him, how deep is the relationship between him and me,
[945.68] you didn't tell him anything. I told him everything, Chande.
[952.80] He is crazy, his mind is not right, he will be alright soon. He will come back, don't worry,
[959.84] why are you crying?
[963.20]  Chanda don't cry, when you cry
[968.72] then something starts happening to my heart, my whole life has passed
[974.40] in a blink of an eye, where have I reached in my life,
[982.64] I have become old. My life was spent in the desire
[989.96] to marry you. I died in this desire,
[997.68] but you are still not mine.
[1005.04] You will get Guddu back. I will bring him back to you
[1015.20] Chanda ...
[1019.52] I am about to die. Before I die, I want to remove the burden from my chest.
[1030.88] I am guilty towards you; I lied to Shreham.
[1043.32] he asked me,
[1045.12] I said to him
[1050.76] that you are a sex worker
[1060.04] I lied that you are a sex worker
[1073.88] Why did you do this?
[1083.08] Why did you do this? Why did you do this?
[1089.48] Why you did this?
[1096.50] [Music]
[1104.80] [Music]
[1112.44] Chande, forgive me, I did it because I am selfish
[1119.76] kill me, I am selfish. Love is selfish
[1125.76] Forgive me. 
[1129.60] I beg at your feet
[1135.36] Hey Chanda
[1139.88] Did you hurt your hand? I am bringing Guudu
[1147.48] For God's sake, don't cry!
[1150.77] [music]
