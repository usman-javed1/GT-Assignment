[0.00] Son, what luck you have got
[3.84] in life, you never got what you wanted.
[9.40] No one gets everything in life.
[14.58] Mother? And we even can't force.
[21.69] I was not in love with Whisky; I just wanted to settle down.
[30.72] If I cannot become part of this home, so what? I'll find another home.
[36.97] Why are you lying to me? I'm your mother. 
[42.00] And mothers know everything about what their children want.
[47.28] But, my dear, mothers are often very helpless. I couldn't give you anything in life.
[56.27] I don’t know if I can do anything more in the future. No, mother.
[61.95] I don't want anything from you. Don't worry. But then you always say that.
[68.68] Everyone has to face what fate has written for them. We've endured it until now, and we'll continue to live on.
[80.10] I can't see you sad, just wait for few days,
[87.14] Who knows if Zarka will Marry him or not? No, mother.
[95.27] I can't live my life hanging on the cross,
[101.14] once your hope is broken, 
[105.05] then it's over forever!
[109.05] Just stop thinking about it. Just don't think about anything.
[115.36] Rani, dear, I'm thinking about you.

[138.25] Assalamualaikum.
Walaikum salam. Are you okay?
Yes.
[145.29] Listen ...Yes.
[150.00] I don't feel like eating the food from home.
[155.11] Can you please take me out to eat?
[162.70] You know Shumail and her mood—how she reacts to everything.
[171.32] It will create a new trouble for me.
[175.54] I'm so sorry ... Please
[180.94] [Music]
[213.45] I was just thinking about finding out when you would come. Why?
[217.33] It’s been a while since we visited Aunty, so I thought we should go there.
[222.68] Alright, let's eat and then we’ll go.Yes, I'll get the food ready.
[225.71]  By the way, this new cooked one is pathetic. The food is really bad. We need to change him.
[232.41] Teach him. Who is there? Come in. Yes, Zarka.
[241.20] Sister, I don't like the food prepared by that cook.
[246.84] Its smell is making me feel vomit. Can you order something from outside for my meal?
[254.06] I was just telling Murad that this cook is absolutely useless.
[257.48] He is not cooking well. We have to change him, then let's go out somewhere and have dinner.
[263.00] She is also in the mood. Yes, sure. Thank you, sister. Go and change, get ready.
[269.80] I will call you in a while. Then we will leave
[275.54] They say if the pregnant woman is asking for something to eat
[280.68] should give her immediately.
[286.52] You've found a good excuse of Zarka. That's fine. I'll freshen up, and then we will go.
[302.10] Do like this, then this, take some chicken too
[311.78]  Come on, eat! 
[317.66] Hold it in the other hand
[319.68] One by one. Yes, yes, grab this first. Yes, that's right.
[328.11] Good, now you get it.
[360.87] Will you eat something else? No, fine.
[379.52] You know me well and have known me for a long time.
[386.00] Meeting with Chanda, you can call it my mistake or emotional phase, but that day...
[393.90] I mean that night is a part of my past.
[400.12] That night, I made a promise to Chanda, and to this day. 
[405.94] It has been stabbing my heart like a thorn. I just wanted to be free from that pain.
[412.77] Otherwise, meeting Chanda or continuing to meet her was not difficult for me.
[417.72] Listen.
[423.96] I have come to understand that a courtesan is just a courtesan.
[432.00] So then what were you trying to ask her that day? 
[437.16] I don't even know why I stopped her or what I wanted to say.
[444.40] anyway ... Zaira ...
[449.18] our life is peaceful
[453.70] I can't tolerate tension in your life or in my own.
[460.30] So please, after today, we won't discuss this topic anymore.
[469.86] And you know how loyal I am as a husband.
[477.55] Yes, I know.
[482.32] So, you must also know that I don't take lunch.
[486.42] And it's 10:30 PM, I'm really hungry. I'm so sorry. I'm setting table
[502.86] Then you're talking about going there. There will be a commotion.
[506.21] If Chanda auntie and Hema auntie find out, they will create a scene.
[510.00] And anyway, those people have already forbidden it. I don't care about them.
[514.93] That's why I'm saying you come with me.
[519.25] Only you can explain to Zarka. I will wait outside.
[523.51] And if Zarka wants, she can call me inside.
[529.12] I don’t know about it whisky. I don't know if Mom will even let me go.
[534.00] Do something, Rani. Tell Mom that you really want to meet Zarka.
[540.00] Just create some kind of situation. She'll understand. And you'll explain everything to her step by step.
[546.81] Also tell her that the Whisky is ready to fall in her feet.
[553.24] Look, look, I’m bowing down to you.
[566.05] Rani, you don't feel any pity for me.
[571.91] Leave my feet. Keep this all safe for Zarka.
[581.02] There is no use of begging here.
[585.57] You can do something for me. You are the one who understands my pain.
[591.12] And everyone else is insulting me in my pain.
[602.08] I understand your pain. That's the punishment I'm enduring.
[609.87] In front of your pain, I've even forgotten my own. I'm telling you, Rani.
[616.54] If I don't find Zarka, then I will be like a stray dog in dirty streets. I will give my life.
[625.58] Just talk to her once for my sake. Explain to her how much I’m suffering for her love.
[636.15] She will believe your words. Get up, leave my feet.
[645.11] Swear on my head. Swear that you will tell her everything.
[651.35] swear on my head!
[655.98] Yes, I swear on your head, I will explain it to her.
[662.30] You will tell her my situation honestly. Swear it.
[671.37] Yes, I will tell her everything. Just like your own feelings.
[689.65] Just like I would share my own feelings.
[697.37] You are so good. You are really wonderful, Rani.
[717.32]  
[725.48] Rani, don't talk about this
[729.31] And anyway, Hema has already told that they have forbidden everyone from coming home.
[735.78] And Chanda won't let you go. Mom, make up some excuse.
[742.92] Anyway, we will leave this place forever.
[747.54] Then whether we meet anyone in life or not. I haven't told Chanda about this yet.
[755.43] Why, Mom? I will tell her before leaving. If I tell her now, she will stop me.
[762.00] Then, Mom, please get me permission to go to Zarka's house. 
[768.00] Okay, I will talk, it is too late now. Please get up, turn off the light.
[775.27]  Go to sleep, I’m feeling sleepy too. Just go over there.
[786.08] By the way, Rani, I am very happy, I feel very good that you have come. I was very scared, I have come
[792.12] I had heard that you have refused everyone to come here.
[800.77] Yeah, because of the Whisky.
[807.81] He was trying to ruin my home. Oh well.
[816.49] You're saying this, Zarka?
[824.88] I can't forget all my life what he has done to me
[833.16] Now he is suffering for you.
[836.96] Like a wounded bird, falling in everyone's feet. 
[847.40] Now, even if he fall in my feet.
[852.97] There is no place for him in my heart 
[858.00] And then, Rani, try to understand.
[864.60] I have now become someone else's.
[869.16] But Zarka, Whiskey did all this for your benefit.
[875.72] My benefit? He neither kept the honor of the relationship nor 
[880.50] thought of his mother's pain nor my pain. He just wanted money which he got. 
[893.06] How many days of fun he must have had with that money? Zarka.
[899.80] Now forgive the Whisky, he realized when you left.
[907.61]  That he loves you. He loves you a lot. 
[923.54] I feel pity after seeing him. You will also see him, 
[930.48] you will also feel bad for him.
[935.83] A wife's heart never melts for another man Rani
[943.96] The one you are wife of, you have to leave him and all this and
[948.60] come back. I will still not take his help and I
[957.52] the days I will spend here with my husband.
[963.48] After that, his memories will become my support. My child will be my support.
[971.04] Will they allow you to meet your child?
[980.33] They won’t let me meet, but Rani...
[986.32] Will this feeling not enough that I have a legitimate child?
[992.41] In this city.
[998.21] Rani, try to understand.
[1003.33] He can no longer make a place in my heart. There’s no space for him in my heart anymore.
[1012.80] Zarka, Whisky will die without you. He will die.
[1023.19] Let him die.
[1030.13] if you care so much about him, then marry him
[1035.93] [Music] 
[1043.47] [Music]
[1048.10] The person who is dying for you.
[1053.42] How can I marry him?
[1062.27] A person dying for you, how can he marry me?
[1072.23] He has gone mad.
[1075.46] make him understand that he should forget me. Don't talk like this Zarka.
[1082.72]  have you forgotten? You too, loved Whisky very much. Yes, I loved him
[1089.23] I loved him like crazy, I couldn't even think of living without him
[1103.34] But now I have become someone else's, Rani.
[1109.60] [Music]
