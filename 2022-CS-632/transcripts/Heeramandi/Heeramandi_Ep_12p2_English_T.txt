[0.04] Now, how will you become a big man? Come on, how will you become?
[3.96] Your name has been cut off from school. They won't let you step in again. You
[9.56] were born for this day, now you become a courtesan, tie your anklets and
[17.04] dance. Bastard, curse on you. Why did I give birth to you, why didn't
[23.20] I kill you in my stomach? I should have poisoned myself and you too. Come on, I
[28.04] won't leave you now. You’ve ended up being just like everyone else.
[35.16] Shame on you.
[39.37] I ended up being insulted there
[45.20] Why am I working so hard and earning money if it’s not benefits you, if
[49.96] you have to become a transgender or courtesan, than do. What are you doing?Come on, pick up
[56.84] your things, Hey Guddu Guddu
[62.12] Guddu, where are you going, Guddu. Don't study, my prince, have fun and dance. Who here has
[68.76] seen the school and which Chief Minister do you want to become? Your mother is crazy, I
[73.44] will talk to her. No, I don't want to go to her, she will hit me again. I
[78.92] will stay with you only in your room. Now no one will argue with me. But what happened?
[84.92] My teacher made me dirty, I had gone with musical anklet, I was dancing she lodged a complaint there against me
[90.88] They cut off my name from school. Mother hit me all the way to home. Look at me, see
[95.88] how much she has hit. Oh, there are even fingerprints here, man. Now how can
[100.96] I go? Hey Guddu, Hey Guddu, come on, your mother is calling you. I will not go,
[108.36] she beat me so much, she will hit me again. She will not hit you, I guarantee. Come. 
[114.04] leave him, check his back. All marks there, now what else she want. 
[121.36] Your mother wants to make you a big man, my child.
[126.28] I'm a small man, I'm fine, I don't want to be a big man.
[129.36] Listen to me, she is your mother. Who can love,
[137.00] she can also hit you. She has the right. No, I won't go and she is not my mother any more.
[142.88] Oh, don't talk nonsense, I will break your teeth. Go lafray, he is angry, once he will cool down he will come.
[150.96] Okay, fine
[155.92] I am leaving, are you coming? You go, I will come later. Okay,
[165.44] Go quickly to your mother. Hey, who is he to scold me?
[173.12] He is ...
[176.60] He is your uncle. Call him uncle. He hates this name.
[184.64] Well see how I tease him in the name of Uncle. That's like my Boy. You sit here,
[192.40] now rest, I have to meet a customer. I will come with you if he come in your absence, he
[199.24] will drag me to home.
[203.24] Okay, come on, you too have to learn one day, how to handle a customer.
[211.08] Come on, let's go. Why are you making your life difficult by crying?
[219.52] I wish aunty I had listened to you.
[226.08] Now I will cry all my life. There was a hope that his father
[234.48] would come back. Why are you holding on to such hope? Respected people do not return after giving birth to a child.
[240.76] Respected people do not think what a doom
[247.88] a night spent in their brothel brings,
[251.12] their blood gets spilled in this filth
[256.74] Once I find Sheram, he accepts me or not
[262.64] I just want to hand over Guddu to him, so that
[267.40] his blood won't gets raise in this filth. Even if he comes to know about it, he will not
[273.72] take him. These noble people
[278.56] commit crimes in the dark and in the morning light they forget that their crimes are thriving in that darkness
[284.24] So control yourself,
[289.36] Throw that man out of your mind and think of Guddu, he
[297.20] will support you in your old age. I will explain it to him. But Chanda, don't hit him. Lafra
[305.88] says right now, he is small, when he grows up, he will understand himself. Oh God!
[311.64] Give my son sense or give me death. What kind of things are you talking?
[320.36]  I am getting scared in the name of death, by the way, this brothel is empty now, you
[328.44] will talk like this, it will completely destroy 
[333.00] So do I like to talk like this? You have no idea
[338.32] how much I have been insulted in school.
[342.24] I was always ashamed of being a courtesan, but today I have never felt so much shame
[349.64] in my life. The principal and
[354.04] teacher of the school were saying so proudly that we are decent people. Your child can't study here.
[361.12] I want so much in my heart to say that I too am as noble as you
[367.12] but I can't say that aunty. Please stop, my heart is worried,
[376.24] why are you seek in the outside world? The place where you were born
[381.12] You should kill yourself in the same well, otherwise people outside
[387.64] will kill you. Come on,
[391.96] get up and get fresh. Everything will be fine. Go now
[400.08] I will talk to him. 
[405.26] [Music] 
[417.51]  
[428.68] [Music]
[439.07] [Music]
[443.60] May I sit here? Why? I want to talk to you.
[448.52] Sit down
[457.36] Have you seen fairies?
[464.32] this long hair, these intoxicating eyes, the lips like rose petals and when she speaks, bell rings
[473.20] If a man sees then he will be totally surprised.
[479.72] Wait for me outside; I’ll come after I pay my bills
[485.12] See, this is how we do. No cheating with my commission Vodka. Hey, where did your commission
[494.28] come from? You have started cheating on me. I am not cheating you. I quoted Rs 500. Hey,
[499.92] otherwise you were taking 200 only. Okay, I
[505.60] will give you something, at least let the customer bring the money first. 
[512.80] [Music]
[518.76] If there is still a good girl in you, then it's my duty that I will take you
[524.44] out of this mess and take you to my home.
[529.76] Will you wait for me? I might take few days
[535.36] to come back to you, I will talk to my parents and than take you.
[542.80] Believe me, I will definitely come.
[547.36] Till then you Keep this money for expenses so that
[553.16] you don't face any compulsion.
[557.64] Wait for me,
[562.92] Sir, you are sure that you will come back? Yes, I am sure. You
[569.52] will not forget?
[576.84] No
[580.16] I don't want money sir. I
[586.04] will wait for you. Imagine that a girl named Chanda
[593.16] will be waiting for you. Neither will she sleep nor will she die. You also remember
[600.43]  A boy named Sheram promised you
[604.80] that he will return to give you a good life.
[609.14] [Music]
[617.13] Give me my commission. Have patience
[630.60] I am giving you
[634.44] take this. Yours Rs 100. take this, what will you remember
[641.12] Mother, after becoming big man I will earn a lot.
[646.08] but I have started earning from now. She will be so happy to know this.
[651.32] Okay, you promise that whenever you go to get a customer, you will definitely take me along.
[659.80] Okay Prince, I will take you along, but next time you have to talk to the customer as well.
[665.20] You have to trap the customer. I will do better than you,
[672.12] you just see. By the way Prince, you have lost this money in cards
[678.33]  
[680.92] Give me my money back
[693.84] Come inside, come inside. I will hit you badly
[700.56] If I saw you again I will break your legs. Take him away from here.
[707.20] what has happened? Why are you both hitting him. You want to take his life?
[712.36] Go to Zeenat room. Go inside. Now tell me, what he has done? 
[721.20] Husna Bai, he was bringing customers. He had started it. I said that
[728.32] he will not improve. What do you think? A child brought up in a brothel will do something else. Hey, he will do
[734.60] only what he sees. What you are trying to make an urban boy, don't
[739.44]  dream like this. A frog's baby remains a frog and
[745.60] does not become a flying bird. Move
[750.93]  
[755.12] Chanda Chanda, my love, see and listen to me. By the way Chanda, Husna Bai was
[765.04] absolutely true. Was she right? Oh look what she is saying is that
[773.44] we are trying to make frog baby a bird. This is not going to happen,
[777.60] By the way,
[781.16] I have started thinking about one more thing, neither would you have a child nor would
[786.28] you get sorrow. Or else we would have gone away from here, I mean, leave it, why are you spoiling your heart,
[791.64] leave him on his own. How leave?
[797.76] and my dreams, I have reached here. I send him to school, 
[804.32]  counsel him all night. How I can leave him. Okay, let's not hurt yourself, let's talk with love,
[813.52] he will agree. With love kids can be handle well. 
[818.04] Why are you crying, you have cried all your life, even then your fate has not changed, how this
[823.40] child's fate will change? I have hard luck. Shall I bring something for you to eat?
