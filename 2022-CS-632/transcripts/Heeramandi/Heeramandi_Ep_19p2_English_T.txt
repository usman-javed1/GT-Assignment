[55.00] It's looking beautiful on you. I have brought you as per my choice,
[60.60] Hi Whiskey, how much do you care about my likes and
[64.48] dislikes. Who else's happiness will I take care of? Mother does not talk to me
[71.44] Pari is not my friend and Lafrah is also like my mother.
[74.96] Then only you are left. Whisky, can I say
[80.72] something? Don't bring customers for me. I
[89.56] want to dance only for you. Don't say such things, this is our business. If we don't do this, then
[95.96] how we will survive? This area is already empty, only you Pari are left. You won't
[102.32] dance than how we will earn?
[105.72] Whiskey, why don't you do some other work? You drive a rickshaw, You
[113.20] just pick up the passengers and take
[116.60] them to their destination. And if you make them sit, then at least not for me. 
[123.76] Listen to me, let's get married and
[130.52] go somewhere far away from here. Oh wow, if we get married and
[138.08] go away, no one will be able to find us. No, you are crazy, I
[144.00] have no intention of marriage and tell me one thing that if we get married, what will happen to Mother?
[148.28] Where Hema Aunty and Pari will go?I  don't want to marry right now.
[154.20] It means you don't love me. Why do you bring love in between?
[160.08] Look, I love you, I
[165.12] don't want to get married
[175.65] Okay ... I will think about it!
[182.66] [Music]
[191.56] Crazy!
[203.00] Zarka ... Hey Zarka, 
[210.20] You haven't eaten anything since morning, eat something if you say, I
[216.88] will bring food here. No Mother, I am not hungry, you go, I will eat myself
[227.07] [Music]
[256.56] She is not ready? She is absolutely ready, see how beautiful she is looking.
[260.68] Mashallah, looking very pretty. Where are Rani and Pari?
[267.84] They are not ready yet? They are ready, I am sending them to you, you also get ready.
[278.42] Can I ask you one thing? Yes
[287.00] You are getting your husband married, don't you feel bad?
[296.32] You must also know very well that
[300.68] any woman can't tolerate any other woman with her husband. 
[305.48] But the biggest problem of us is Child!
[310.40] My husband has absolutely no interest in second marriage.
[314.88] When aunty told him that if he wants to see you or want to meet you, then he can do
[322.24] so, he flatly refused and said that he is doing this only because of me because
[328.80] I want a child.
[331.80] God has deprived me of the blessing of a child, otherwise
[337.76] this situation would have never occurred. Are
[342.12] you doing all this because you love your husband very much?
[348.20] My husband does not want to do all this at all
[351.68] because he loves me very much, he
[360.40] is doing all this only because of my wish, do not
[365.28] forget one thing that we are doing this marriage only for the child and that too 
[373.32] because I forced him.
[377.00] You will not have any relation with him, I mean there can be any
[382.76] relation, maybe he never talk to you and yes, as soon as we will know
[390.08] that you are expecting, you will be paid more and inshallah when the child 
[395.20] is delivered, we will clear all your payments but yes after that we
[402.24] will never have any relation with you. Don't worry,
[408.48] I know that I will not have any relation with you all
[413.36] You people want child from me and I want money from you people, that's all
[421.36] By the way
[425.84] there was no relationship in courtesan's life. 
[433.34]  My daughters kept yearning for relationships all their life,
[441.24] all the relationships were present, auntie uncle, everyone
[448.44] is present but their hard luck
[451.72] now this relationship, this is also for few days.
[456.92] What if Whisky would have married Zarka!
[463.08] Hema, there is no use of crying now and anyway, it was Zarka's decision. Zarka took this
[472.48] decision because Whiskey had humiliated her and refused to marry her,
[478.44] I had been expecting for a long time when she will become Whisky's bride
[484.64] I have been telling you for a long time that he doesn't want this.
[491.52] My heart is worried, I will return their money, I
[497.08] will bring my daughter back. This is not the time to talk non sense. Look
[503.56] Madam is sending the car and it's about to arrive.
[510.36] Get up, get ready, Zarka is waiting for us there
[517.19] Hema, there is no use of these things, and listen,
[523.64] even after going there, don't talk like that
[527.25] Come on, get up!
[530.72] I don't know when my Zarka will return
[536.16] whether she will come back, whether she will live or die
[542.72] but I will never forgive Whisky for this

[717.68] sit 
[734.60] Zarka, sometimes life puts woman in a difficult exam
[740.44] Only I know the pain of handing over
[747.04] my husband to another woman. Do
[754.36] you understand?
[761.72] He will be your husband just for one night,
[770.36] My God knows what I am going through
[777.32] and I hope my God will take me out of this situation,
[782.00] I can only pray 
[801.00]  
[810.96] When I earn a lot of money then I will marry you and you know,
[816.84] I will decorate room in such a way that you will hide in the flowers, nobody will know
[821.16] which one are flowers and where are you.
[838.04] When will you take me to the seashore? Why do
[842.68] you want to die by drowning? Yes, with you. You will go and taking me too. I am saying this,
[847.96] because my birthday is coming. Your birthday is coming, so what should I do?
[852.36] Let's do one work, I will show you a good film. We will go to the cinema. Yes yes, let's go,
[857.68] Which movie we will watch? I don't even know which film to watch. Any love
[861.32] story we will watch. That's why, I say
[866.24] you are so spoiled. Don't watch such movies, keep distance with me, you are spoiling me too.
[870.72] I watch it only because of you, why because of me? I will marry you, you are my fiancee.
[876.92] If you said once again, I will jump from here. Then jump
