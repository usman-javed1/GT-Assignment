[0.12] Are you ready to support me?
[3.88] I am ready to support you in every way, if it is proved that Chanda is really yours, I
[9.40] will get you married and I am also ready to keep both of you in my house till your
[14.48] parents agree. She is mine. Yes, she is yours,
[20.20] don't mind but let me tell you one thing, if I prove that Chanda was
[28.44] someone else last night.
[37.20] Asalam alekum Shehram brother, thank God, I saw you here. Actually
[46.28] Chanda has send a message for you.
[52.64] You know that we have made a big deal with you, no cheating with you
[57.60] Don't talk nonsense,
[61.96] I had given her money, she refused it because she ... You know why she refused?
[67.52] She want to take 20 instead of 10, this is the issue. By the way, you
[74.24] never came back. Lafrah, tell me that Chanda is really waiting for Shehram? I mean
[79.88] last night was she waiting for Shehram or someone else? She was
[86.92] definitely waiting. I mean, you have to pay money but then she went to someone else,
[93.28] our work was done as he payed double money. He was an honest man, a very honest man.
[99.28] Our Golden Jubilee is complete
[102.56] Shehram!
[107.52] Sir, my food? I will bring you food. Hey, come here.
[127.24] This is the file of this house 
[131.08] and I have transferred this house in the name of Shehram and apart from this, I have
[138.68] also transferred enough money to his bank account.
[144.12] that if he wants to do any business then
[150.48] he can do it.
[153.88] Whatever he has done, according to the law, I should have disown him,
[161.44] You know why did I not do this? I did not do it because
[166.68] one day I will die. Apart from that, I have to satisfy myself too, I
[175.20] just want you to tell him this thing properly,
[181.04] from today onwards we have no relation with him,
[187.76] neither with me nor with his mother. Uncle, please listen to me
[197.76] Now don't say that you want to favour him, You
[204.20] want to favor him on such a bad thing? I am not favouring, I am just saying that when
[209.32] children do not get attention at home, when no one listens to them.
[214.96] They search for love outside.
[218.12] Love can't be measured.
[226.20] All the parents in the world love their children. Mehmood, don't
[233.80] say that. You never hugged him lovingly. Didn't ever talk to him nicely.
[241.72] Don't talk non sense, he is not a child, whom should I carry in my arms and
[246.68] love him. How shamefully he was asking
[253.08] to marry him to a courtesan and you want me to talk to him nicely? Welcome Sir,
[261.36] We were waiting for you 
[264.92] Hey, you are here empty hand? What do you mean by this. I mean you should have
[274.80] brought some gajras, fruits, sweets, a pair of clothes for me and Zeenat Amaan, at least. 
[282.52] You are very greedy Husna. No sir, I am not greedy, I am just demanding our rights,
[290.52] Yusuf. Yes sir, take this and flowers, sweets, gajras, whatever you get, and bring it,
[300.40] Okay sir, don't worry, I will be back in no time
[304.16] Husna Bai has fulfilled her promise,
[311.12] saved the Chanda for you, she was so arrogant. 
[318.04]  I will take out her arrogance. I like arrogant people
[325.60] I have habit of taking out the arrogance of big criminals. I 
[333.08] know how to deal. Why not Sir,
[340.08] Who can know better than you? 
[347.76] You know why she refused? Because instead of 10 she want 20 by the way, you did
[356.92] not turn back.
[361.20] I don't want money, I swear not to sell myself, now if I take the money, then the whole life
[367.80] I will feel embarrassed of myself. Other customer arrived, our work was done, he paid double.
[374.76] he was an honest man. You remember this, a girl named Chanda
[381.24] will be waiting for you with her eyes on the door, neither will she sleep nor will she die
[387.62] [Music]
[392.44] At our place sir, there is a celebration but Well, now it
[400.16] was a compulsion, Zeenat Amaan had to go with someone so she went and I am her just
[407.40] for you 
[409.40] Hurry up, keep here
[415.04] This is good
[420.72] Chanda, today have got ready very beautifully, just like a bride.
[430.24] [music]

[445.68] Aman's dress money. Thank you sir, it is very kind of you
[451.12] Now go Chanda, is waiting for you.
[470.52] Look, I am here.
[476.32] What are you doing?
[483.36] Why do people come here?
[489.56] Come on. Get out of my room.
[496.16] How should I go out like this?
[504.16] Husna Aunty, take him out from my room.
[510.92] How Husna Auntie will come? And why she will take me out?
[519.36] She herself has given you to me,
[525.28] By the way, she kept her promise,
[531.40] That's enough,
[536.64] leave me 
[543.40] I am giving you this paan, gave them to Husna Bai. Police man had sent money.
[549.32] Okay. Oh, Phoolan, you are being dishonest, you had promised that this time I
[553.80] will take paan, give it to me. Wait, what do you say. I say, they will not
[561.00]  let him enter, give this to me, I will give it. I am coming, stay
[565.48] You stay here. Hey Lafrah, this is not fair.
[571.16]  Asalam alikum Husna Bai, how are you?
[578.44] Walikum Asalam, this is sent by Phoolan. 
[582.72] I am saying, don't come near. Chanda? Yes, there is no need to go, give me paan
[588.40] and go away. It's Chanda. Yes, go now. It will take time, go,
[599.48] But Husna Bai ... I said to you ... Get Lost!
[604.04] Husna Bai .... You going or ....
[614.36] Leave me. Stop this or I will shoot you? I understand, I will shoot
[623.68] Sir, who is this? Sir, it is wireless. DSP sir
[632.56] is reaching the police station. You go I am coming. Yes sir.
[638.76] You show great decency, I
[644.76] will take out all your decency and keep you in jail for the rest of your life,
[651.68] otherwise change my name. Go, threaten someone else with jail, I will die
[659.80] but not with you
[666.11]  Hey, what happened sir?
[671.88]  Listen to me carefully
[682.64] Okay?
[688.62] You have gone mad? 
[696.60] You will send all courtesans to jail, they all will tear you apart.
[701.88] He was so angry. He will destroy you now.
[707.32] What will he do? Will he put me in jail? Let him do. Will he kill me?
[714.36] I am not afraid of anyone. You also remember one thing, in the future
[721.88] if you send anyone to my room, there is no one worse than me. He will take it out now you arrogance
[734.22] [Music]
[739.89] [Music]
[753.80]  You have lighter? Weather is pleasant today.
[765.40] There should be something to enjoy this weather. Yes. Do you want it? What do you mean?
[775.56] Where is the girl? Not here, sir. If you come with us then I will show you
[781.60] First, show me. I will show you there. Let's go. You have enough money. it
[789.28] Is this work possible without money? Your glasses clicked me that
[796.56] there is something in you. I am waiting for you. Why you are sitting like this?
[802.84] it has been so many days, your lover has not come and your busy in looking at his gift
[809.56] you are looking as if you will rub the ring and suddenly he will come out of it.
[813.72] Leave this, Chanda, these stories of love and affection.
[819.40] happens in novels only. Everyone wants something from you.
[825.16] Stop crying now and back to business, if you had been with us yesterday, you would have earn something
[830.60] Although they were all useless, but me, Champa and Babra earned 3000 each
[836.16] only for dancing in one night,
[840.24] Leave it Zeenat Amaan, what is the use of telling her. Dil Ara died and left her burden on us
[848.04] She is the bone in the throat, neither we can spits nor swallows
[854.50] [Music]
[858.52] [ Song ]
[866.60] [Song]
[875.00] [Song]
[884.64]  What are you doing Vodka? 
[892.72] Acting like a courtesan. Bari Amma, I wish I too was a courtesan,
[898.52] instead of taking rents from you, I would have danced in the night and
[903.96] make money. Seriously Babra, next time you take me with you, I will apply make up and
[910.36] wear girls clothes, the customer won't be able to know which is the real thing.
[915.56] Look at him. Champa he is trying to destroy our business.
[921.56] He is looking like a girl with make-up. Go away from here.
[927.08] I had come to talk to Amma, Amma, increase the rent, inflation has increased,
[932.76] Survival is difficult, petrol has become Rs.50 kilos. You have gone crazy?
[938.64] what will you do with so much money? You eat lunch with me and dinner
[943.56] at Chanda's place or with Lafrah? What is the need for you? Just
[948.52] do this, stop drinking petrol. I don't drink petrol. Then what will you do?
[954.80] Drive a car on petrol? Petrol has become expensive.
[959.68] Okay, enough now. I am having a headache, it's so hot outside. Should I
[964.92] come in the evening? Yes. Hey, leave my scarf.
[970.52] [Song]
[977.56] Asalamalikum Husna Bai. Walikumsalam, come,
[987.16] Sit. I am here just to ask
[993.20] My friend Shehram came here? Why will he come here?
[998.88] We have good clients for our Chanda.
[1001.88] Where is Shehram? No, I have come to see that he has come here or not?
[1010.84] I just told you that he has not come here.  Sir, listen to me, I am looking for Shehram,
[1017.64] does he have any number? Chanda, he is already married. He has gone out of the country,
[1023.36] I just came to see if he came here before leaving. Hey, if he has
[1029.92] gone out of the country, then how will he come here
[1033.70] Okay, I am leaving, Allah Hafiz
[1043.80] [Music]
[1058.56] I heard that the man, Chanda was waiting for the one who had promised to marry her has
[1065.60] gone out of country after getting married, Zeenat told me. Chanda is mentally disturbed. She don't
[1073.84] know that no one loves us. Hey Amma, she must not have seen that movie Umrao Jaan Ada,
[1082.44] otherwise she doesn't wait. She was waiting like Umrao Jan Ada,
[1088.92] she must have seen the film,
[1093.44] I have heard that all the ashes have fallen off, Husna was saying that now she
[1101.56] is ready to dance also. Definately, after all it is a question of the sinful stomach. Yes
[1109.04] it is the stomach that forces a person, Hey Why are you sitting here reading magazine?
[1116.60] Go make tea for me and listen add extra milk in it.
[1130.68] Okay than? Auntie and uncle are very tense. I am
[1137.92] here since morning, don't tell his mother that
[1141.72] he is missing, you know that she will get worried,
[1147.44] Then? you just say that he is with a friend
[1153.84] Okay, it's fine if he is with a friend. Then it's fine, thank you Zahid, it's also
[1160.52] good that we know where he is. Okay, Allah Hafiz
[1166.36] What happened? He is at a friend's house, Zahid has tried to explain a lot
[1173.84] but he is not ready to come. You relax and go. I promise, I will send him back to America
[1185.48]  
[1190.55]  [Music]
[1205.29] [Music]
[1219.00] Why are you standing?
[1224.28] Kulsom, your son will not come.
[1232.64] because he will come after we leave
[1238.92] to bring that courtesan to this house, the house needs to be empty,
[1245.36] It's flight time. We are getting late,
[1251.88] come, let's go
[1257.08] come, there is no use of wasting your time,
[1263.96] Allah Hafiz 
[1269.28] and take good care of yourself, come. You go, I am coming
[1282.08] I have only your support, 
[1287.04] Iflooks tall,
[1296.72] keep one thing in mind, don't let him marry in Tawaf, son,
[1302.92] explain to him that the honor of the family is not to be taken away in the market like this.
[1307.92] Look, how proudly and respectfully we have lived in this house.
[1315.84] Lest he turn this house into a hut,
[1319.36] Sahara, son, my only hope is in Allah and you.
[1323.20] I know you will make him understand. And
[1328.40] see, when he gets angry, he does not eat food for many days.
[1339.44] Kulsoom, it is getting late, please. Come quickly
[1344.40] [Music]
[1345.67] [Applause] [Music]
[1347.52] No house keys
[1352.72] [Applause] [Music]
[1356.60] [Laughter] [Music]
[1361.58] [Applause]
[1366.40] Son,
[1375.96] where were you thinking about him? Do you have any idea about someone's problem?
[1383.04] How worried were you? Amma, do you know what has happened to us, if you had not met us,
[1388.84] but at least you would have told us where you were, at least you would not have gone crazy searching for us,
[1392.52] where
[1396.84] was everyone, with that wife, she had hidden you or you somewhere. Had taken
[1404.32] her somewhere [Music]
[1410.28] Tell me, haven't you married her?
[1414.88] Tell me, haven't you married her? Have you come here after getting her drunk? Open me, open me, dry me.
[1421.32] If you can go there, you can drink alcohol too,
[1424.92] right? I don't drink alcohol or even
[1430.20] go to the music [music]. In your eyes, there is no Tawaf,
[1435.16] what is its name? Only the body is not sold. Every bad habit
[1441.64] is sold there to control men, but what difference does it make to you? If it
[1446.00] is not yours then consider your mother, think about what she must have gone through,
[1452.16] how much she has been crying. My heart wanted to take her
[1457.24] straight to the place where you are debauchering you in such a condition. If you see, maybe
[1460.92] their hearts will find peace.
[1465.40] Close the door, where are you going [Music]
[1472.52] Home takes too long, people are gone [Music]
[1487.76] America, all men are the same Chanda, you are still a child, you have nothing to do with them right now
[1495.40] There was the first man who came into your life,
[1500.40] you made him disrespectful. Every person who comes here declares
[1507.00] that he will sacrifice his life for us, will leave his home, will marry and take us home,
[1513.80] but all this
[1517.96] is exempted from this brothel. The first step is taken outside and one forgets everything.
[1523.72] Here no one belongs to anyone else,
[1529.68] why don't we give money, why can't anyone be ours?
[1534.48] What crime have we committed and
[1540.52] I, I don't even talk to anyone, you know, I
[1547.64] could have asked Sumi, I could have gone to the locality and asked some other girl about me,
[1554.00] if she had found something wrong with me or she Had it been known that I was meeting someone else, I
[1560.24] would have left the lie. Why did he lie? No one
[1567.16] tells me the truth. Mother also died talking like this. She lived her whole life hoping
[1573.44] that someone would come to marry her. Will take him but no one
[1579.36] has come, his dead body has gone from this very brothel.
[1585.92] Look son,
[1592.56] people like us are not destined to have a husband and a home. Take care of yourself
[1598.92] [Music] I know it hurts a lot,
[1604.60] those who give pain go away and never come back.
[1610.32] Tears coming, don't even go to ask,
[1616.24] go to sleep, it's too late,
[1627.48] I just went there on the advice of my friends,
[1630.92] you won't believe but for the first time in my life, I went to the brothel of a Tawaf,
[1638.04] I liked it, the second Tawaf. She told me that she
[1646.56] doesn't want to be sold, she wants to get married
[1649.83] [sangeet]
[1656.68] And you, like an idiot, offered her marriage without even thinking about who you are,
[1662.56] what is your family background, has anyone ever told you in your childhood? I have never seen the face of such
[1665.68] a place and you had gone to marry her. Has the ghost descended? It
[1672.04] would have been better if it had descended two days earlier. Now only one thing can be done -
[1678.76] you go to America, I will not go to America. You know brother, I
[1685.76] like you very much. No, they created so much hatred for me in Amma Abba's heart,
[1691.12] no one has done anything, everything happened because of your actions
[1695.21] [Music]
[1698.92] I am going, where are you going home, stay here, go in the morning, Rehman's
[1707.44] clothes are
[1710.20] food. I had eaten, I had eaten, okay, if you want tea or coffee,
[1716.08] please let me know, if I fell asleep then I will not be able to get up again, no, I am fine, it
[1721.56] is enough for me that you are caring for me so much, don't talk too much.
