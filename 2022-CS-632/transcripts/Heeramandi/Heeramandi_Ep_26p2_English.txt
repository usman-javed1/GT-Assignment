No, I have very good fortune, you know, whatever I asked from God, I have got it. Tell me one thing Rani, how long does it take for a child to be born? What does it mean? How long it takes a child to be born? You don't know? Don't act like a child. I know! Can't it happen quickly? What's wrong with you? What are you talking about? Where are you going? I am coming in a short while. How much time a child born? Stupid! He is that woman's husband? Yes! I'm thinking, why I went. I should not go there. Neelum, today there was no distance between him and me. He didn't say anything? I didn't hear anything, even though he was saying, 'Answer my question. I don't know what he would have asked. I was in such a bad state, that's why I ran away from there. Thank goodness his wife came from behind. He got startled and I slipped out from the back. But Chanda should tell him that Whisky is his son. How can I tell him? And what should I say, that I couldn't raise his child? I couldn't provide proper upbringing.  Yes, you should tell him. Even the respectable man would find out about a night spent with a courtesan. It puts his dignity at stake. Don't they think that they could also have children? Those who grow up to become either a courtesan or a pimp. I can't say, and I don't want to say. [Music]  You have fallen asleep. What you are understanding can't be true. Can I do something like that? Yes, this tension sometimes risen up within me. That night with Chanda—wasn't the biggest mistake of my life? A person's sins are remembered much more than his good deeds. This is not called a love; it's called regret! The truth is this Zaira, After seeing her, my doubt turned into belief.  Indeed, my sin has been proven to be excessive.   You are listening to me? [music] We have thought about the child's name. If it's a boy or if it's a girl, what name will we give. We? But you didn't even ask me. Can't I name the child? You can name it, why can't you? If you have a good name in mind, just let me know and we will final it. Zarka, Oh, haven't you finished your juice yet? Murad, tell her to finish the juice. Yes. Drink the juice, it's good for you. After this, we have to go to the hospital to meet the doctor.  We need to register your name at the hospital. After that, we will go to the market and buy a lot of clothes for the child. Okay. I will prepare breakfast. Did you call that doctor? I was about to do that. I forgot, I am sorry, I'm doing it now. I will prepare breakfast. Look Chanda, I have bought whiskey, he is standing outside, now you end this conversation. See, if everyone treats him with such hatred, his mind will keep spinning like a madman.  Oh, forget it. Listen to me. Look, he is your child too. He also have the right to love you. And I only know one thing: if you scold children to get them to agree, they will never listen. If you talk to him nicely, he will agree. Look, Chanda, you have only one son. He spends all his time hanging out outside. It has been a long time since he has been sleeping in Lafrah's room. Please forgive him. Look, that poor person has nothing else in this world except a mother's love.  What do you all think? I don't love him. What should I do? When he comes to me, he ignites my heart. Leave it Chanda, he is not the one who burns your heart, the one who did have long gone time ago. And you are taking out his anger on him. Look, Chanda. If his father left him, what is his fault in that? Even if he has become like this, it's not Whisky's fault, right? You yourself say that the Vodka and lafrah have made him like this. Please forgive him!  Okay, listen to me. I am calling him inside, now you You talk to him lovingly. Shall I call him?  Whiskey, hey whiskey come inside  Come now. Do you like to make mother angry every day, you don't know Heaven lies at mother's feet, come apologize Come on, let's go apologize. Chanda, forgive him. Do you think Guddu, I don't love you? You're crazy; who else do I have besides you? I just want you to be with me all the time, but when you come, you make me angry and boil my blood. Where should I go? What should I do? Okay, Mom, I won't do anything now. Mom, please forgive me. I am very sad; I had thought that when you grow up. I will marry you and live peacefully. My home will flourish. Now I think that when I marry you, we will leave this neighborhood and rent a bungalow somewhere. Hema and Pari also want the same. We will all live together. Mom, I also want us to move somewhere else, and then I can get married. Mom, when Zarka has a baby... ...and she comes back here, then please get me married to Zarka. [Music] I'm putting up pictures of Murad here for Zarka because I want... You should see Murad everywhere, because I want my child to be just like him. Right, Murad? Whose child? Our child! Mine and Murad's, right? Yes, the child will be mine and yours, right? Yes, mine and yours! Mom has lost her mind. You tell me, is there any connection between you and me? You know that I love Zarka, and Zarka loves me. You know everything. And when I told you that Zarka loves you, she's your fiancée. You clearly rejected the idea of marriage. And you also said that you don't love Zarka. You've forgotten everything, Whisky. No, I haven't forgotten anything, Rani. I just didn’t realize that I would feel this way once she left. Leave this, you have never loved anyone, That's why you don't know how love feels or when it hits you. You can't understand this feeling. I know, Whisky. What love is and how it happens. You also love someone? Let it go. No matter the situation, Rani, whatever happens... Tell Mom that if I get married, it will only be to Zarka; otherwise, I won't marry anyone.  I'm swearing, you tell Mom on my behalf. Sister, can I ask something? Yes, go ahead! I didn't realize it before, but now I feel that... You must have felt so much pain when your husband got married. Yes, I used to feel a lot of pain, and that’s why I get angry. But after that, Murad explained to me that... Anyway, I know that you are not his wife. It's just a temporary affair; it will come to an end in few days. And now, there's no need to maintain any relationship; the doctor has said so too. Yes! But sister, there are many people in the world who don't have children. Nobody does that. I have a friend in America. Her elder sister did the same, she advised me. Tell me something... Have you ever loved someone? What is the stake in our love? Whatever we want, we don't get You have loved anyone? No, never! Nothing like that has happened. I can't accept it, you must have liked someone, at least. The one I liked, can't be mine. Oh, how can it not be? tell me I will become your sister and get him married. No sister, I don't want to get married to anyone. Then what will you do? Go back from here and continue with the same dancing and singing? I will do whatever is destined for me. Sister, for you it's only a deal, but for me, it's marriage. If I leave from here, then I will never marry again. Okay, this is your personal matter, I have cut this fruit, eat it, you have to take medicine also and now take some rest. [music]
