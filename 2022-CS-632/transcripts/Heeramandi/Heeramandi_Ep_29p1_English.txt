My child ... Allah has saved my child's life, Oh Allah, thank you! Mother, why are you crying now? I am fine. These are tears of thanks, just get well soon, come home with me, the house is deserted without you. No Mother, do you know what Murad said? He said that I and my child will live with him, he is not divorcing me mother. Mother, have you seen the child? How is he, whom he resembles? I forgot to  ask Murad. He resembles Murad? He resembles both of you. Mother, you know Murad had told me that I should name the child, I will name him Faraz, Faraz is a good name, isn't it? You are feeling fine my child? You just come with me. No mother, I will not go home now, I am very happy with Murad. Yes, my child, Allah has fulfilled my wish that he is not divorcing you. I will pay my gratitude after going home. Mother, where is Pari? and Chanda Aunty hasn't she come? She is coming. Chanda Aunty is not well and Pari has gone downstairs, she is coming. Mother, don't let Whiskey come here, he will create a drama, he will harass them. Don't worry, he won't come here. Guddu, what happened? You have gone mad? You yourself will also die and get us die too.  You will be beaten by sir, one problem is over, you have started another one. Children are not born simple, children are also born through operation. I have apologized to you, yet you are  scolding me. I am saying this because don't speak in front of your mother, otherwise .... I won't do anything and listen, there is no need to tell mother what happened in the hospital, she will say lovingly once, Habib, what happened? and you will tell everything so take care of it I will not tell, come inside. You go, I will come after smoking a cigarette, otherwise she will hit me for this too. You are just rotting your lungs, come quick.  Hey Chande, Hey Chande What happened? Why are you making so much noise? Did you call the hospital, what happened there? I called the hospital; I think baby is born if it had been bad news then they would have called me. Don't talk rubbish. By the way Habib, I am very scared, after the child is born, Zarka will leave her child there? The heart is shaken that how can a mother be separated from her child, She had gone to get money, she will return with the money, end of story. Rest is her destiny, by the way Guddu is right he says this rich people strength their relations with the courtesan, but  to break. Hey Lafray, it's too late, call them and ask. Okay, dial number call Pari. Take this. Hello Pari, how are you? It's me Lafrah. The operation is done. Congratulations, congratulations, thank God. What? What happened? Oh God! Okay, I'll do something. Tell me what happened? Very bad news, the child is dead. Hey, child is dead? Amazing news! Shut up, you bastard. What is the point of keeping quiet, this is a matter of happiness, I am going to take Zarka. You will not go anywhere, sit down otherwise... Otherwise what?  What can anyone do to me? Someone else will do or not, first I will cut both of your legs. She herself will come.She won't come on her own, I will bring her. Guddu, no one will be worse than me if you go there. Okay, I am not going, but I am telling you; I will not stay for long. Don't threat me, go from here. He doesn't know how to talk to elders. Habib, that's why I say don't take him there, He neither celebrate our happiness nor sorrow, I don't know what the condition of Hema and Zarka will be there. Zarka must have gone crazy crying. By the way, we should go there. Let's go. No, I will not go there, he will be there too. Let him be, what he can do? Leave it, now Zarka will come back here, I will give my condolences here. By the way, you should go. Who will be there to take care of Hema and Pari? Okay, okay, I will go. By the way, meeting time is over. The watchman closes the doors. I will call and ask for something. I do something.  He took the phone, he forgot me. He is dead, now what is Murad doing there? Tell him to handover Zarqa to her family members and come back home. There is no humanity in you. I am surprised to see your attitude. You are surprised at my attitude? What do you think about Murad's attitude? He did not even look at me once in the hospital, did not talk to me. He spent the whole time near the door of the operation theater. She was dying. She is saved now, but our child is dead for whom we have suffered so much. Because of you, don't make me open my mouth, if that child is dead, then it is because of you, if Zarka has reached this situation, then it is because of you and let me tell you something, Murad will drop Zarka back but you have created a lot of distance between you and Murad, write this down. Don't worry about the distance at all, leave it to me, I know how to reduce. I know he love me and he can't stay away from me for long. You don't have the slightest sympathy  for the person whose love you are so proud of. You don't even know how much humanity is there in him. Please leave this topic. Please call Murad. Tell him that she must have had leave today, so throw Zarka at her house and come back to his house [music] What are you saying all this, are you hiding something from me? Tell me what you are hiding from me? Murad tell me, what has happened? Our child is no more in this world, our child is no more in this world, Zarka ... Zarka I agree Shumail did bad with you, I apologize to you for that, but see ... what was not in our destiny, how could we stop it? Zarka ... The boy was already dead, that's why operation had to be done No .... Murad .... But I didn't even see his face  Why didn't you tell me? I should have see him. I was helpless, the doctors had forbidden, you were in such a condition What could I do? No .... My baby .... [Music]  [Song] [Song] Why are you so happy, my son? What have is the reason, where are you taking it? Your wedding time is over, now think whose wedding procession will go? I will bring my bride in it. Curse on you! You have been cursing them all your life, remove this ditch from your mind, don't go to her. whether she will come, or they will leave her, that's fine, That's what I am waiting for, otherwise I would have gone to the hospital and bring her and listen to one thing, Lafray, I have agreed with you and mother only because she will come then you will not create trouble. Who is there to go in my wedding procession, except you and mother. Hey, move back, my heart says she will not come. Your heart is lying. Who is calling. Hey, it's that Madam. Hello, Yes madam. Has Zarka reached there? No madam She has not come here, we are also waiting for her. Then go to the hospital immediately and take her. But Madam,  Murad Sir had said that he will call me. What am I telling you, go to the hospital and take Zarka from there immediately, Okay madam, I am going right now. Did you hear it Lafray I used to say, she will live in that house, the work is over, the child is dead, why would they keep her? Go and ask Hema aunty, who else will go to my marriage procession?  Stay away! Go and ask yourself! [Song] I think Murad will leave Zarka at her home. Obviously Shumail already could not tolerate her, why would she do now? By the way, if you ask me, I sympathize with Zarka more than Shumail.  I have made a big mistake. I am very ashamed of myself. When I told you that you were doing wrong, at that time you felt bad. Shehram, I want to tell you something. Go ahead! I never thought like this, but ever since Murad and Zarka got married, this thought keeps coming to my mind that children are very important. What do you want to say? I am the reason for you not having children So? If you want to do second marriage, then I give you permission. Now at this age, getting married for the second time will suit me? It's a matter of race, it's a matter of having a name. You leave these things and tell me that Murad have reached home? Yes, maybe. I don't know. I just wanted to ask whether he has left Zarka or not? [Song] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Zarka? [Song] Zarka, I have come to take you, come quickly. Say Something ... Zarka? Where has she gone? There was a patient in that room, where has she gone? She has gone
