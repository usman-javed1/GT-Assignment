[0.04] Due to you and Badka, my business has come to a standstill, friend, he
[5.56] did not bring any song yesterday, you did not bring it, neither does Seth bring Kareem, nor does Seth bring Nayat Ali.
[10.32] Look at this, all my flowers have dried up, friend. Let's bring four kangas
[15.88] for two or four yardsticks, go here, go there, oh friend, don't worry, double stitch, earn a kalam, friend, don't worry,
[23.76] child, it's a school holiday, it's a school holiday, because of this , all the work is on hold o
[31.00] Don't fool me, oh what relation do you have with school holidays? What a
[35.68] big relation you have, amazing one-eyed friend, you take your
[40.72] wife and children with you during the holidays. There are four more days to go but everything will be fine,
[44.80] so much of your work will be sold, so much of your work will be sold. I swear to God, the flowers will surpass your work,
[50.44] oh sugar in your mouth, oh by the way, listen to this friend, I don't know where this bud is, the night has come,
[59.24] I don't know whether he has slept or not, oh he must be lying in some corner of the man's room crying
[66.16] and look at me right He says, this is what will happen, listen to this good thing, friend, I haven't even had tea today,
[72.84] take it now, O Maqbool, those two cups of tea, page, friend, yes yes, you just order tea, I will
[80.64] bring him to him
[83.36] , black doubt, black black doubt, black is my black
[96.12] [ Music]
[105.20] [Music] Karat bhai ta bhai ya taka to nahi aaya tha
[113.72] why will he come early in the morning, he has troubled me a lot,
[122.12] hi hi, I have to talk to you very important, I
[127.04] have to tell you this, hosanna bhai ka chanda, Amma too must be sleeping. Chanda is also sleeping,
[134.60] what to talk about and in fact he cried a lot for Vaad, come to me
[140.43] [music] rest of the time he loves you, he loves you so much
[146.28] [music]
[149.96] he wants to marry you, you know that he is mad and Why are you telling
[154.96] me everything? Look, whatever he wants, it can't
[159.08] happen, he knows, so I am everything, what to do with Zeenat, whether youth is crazy or
[167.20] medicine, at this age no one stops at what someone says, please make him understand this. Tell me where he
[173.52] is, who knows where he is,
[180.96] please talk to him lovingly sometimes. Should I make him
[186.24] sit on my bed? Amma heard it, she won't even let me climb up from her breasts. You
[191.44] thought, she will be fine on her own. Oh, if I was the one to explain, I would have explained
[196.16] to her long time ago, just talk to me lovingly, it is very kind of you, don't eat my mind,
[203.64] you caught me, come here, come here, come like this, come like this,
[212.92] what happened to you, what happened Heera Bhai What happened, what is to happen, this bastard
[221.64] gave me fake notes, oh you gave me fake notes,
[232.12] wrote Eid Mubarak on the notes, made my girls dance for two hours,
[237.52] you said for two hours that you will give me Rs 2000,
[244.84] let it go, let it go, let it go. If the pauper were real, why would you give me a fake note
[252.00] ? Would I die running after it? I would not have seen this hand either,
[257.36] would I be able to die after going home? What a time has come, man, I have made a fool of you and gone with a fake note, that is bad, oh what happened
[265.44] to us? Fooled us, we fool the whole world,
[270.36] friend, think for yourself, why can't it be legal and Sharan? Is this wrong? It
[278.16] is not wrong, but she is much older than you, it does not matter when
[283.12] the man is 20 years younger than you. If you can marry a younger woman then why
[288.24] not marry a woman six to seven years older Shahram, this decision of yours is as emotional as the decision of Chanda, this decision of mine
[295.00] is not emotional. Look Zahid, I think that it is better than marrying an
[300.00] unknown girl. I should marry a woman whom I know,
[305.08] whose good and bad I am aware of, who can take care of me, who is decent,
[309.80] who is from a good family, who is educated, whether it is big or small, it does not matter, okay, you
[315.96] must have taken this decision after thinking but a little. Take a little more time and think seriously
[322.20] whether you are doing all this out of sympathy for them. Look, I am saying this so
[327.48] that you do not have to regret later, I will not regret, you just tell me
[333.48] that you are with them. Can you go and talk or not? Okay friend, I will talk but
[338.52] you are saying that she has refused. She thinks that I
[344.04] am doing this out of sympathy or because people should defame her because of me but it is not so
[349.32] Zahid. I have thought about it a lot, I feel as if I
[355.76] am incomplete without her, I care about her as if she
[361.68] is my own, yes, it is true that we have never thought about each other's attitude like this,
[366.88] but since Her father-in-law has put this thing in my mind,
[372.96] since then I have been thinking like this,
[377.20] Zahid, I feel as if I cannot leave her alone.
[381.08] I have seen, Zahid, that a single woman cannot survive in this world,
[386.32] people do not let her live. That is why I am saying that think once again, it
[393.04] is very important to have love between each other to live a lifetime and
[397.44] I think that there is no such feeling between you two, friend, you do not accept it.
[403.40] That I am serious, look at me Baba, I agree, I will also talk, okay, you
[409.92] should not just talk, please friend, Munne, we have to convey,
[419.92] look Zahid, what you are calling love is not love, I am not a child,
[423.96] but Shahram is really. He is a child and he himself doesn't even know what he is saying. Tell him that
[429.44] decisions in life are not taken with such emotion,
[432.88] but you will agree that he takes great care of you. Believe me,
[439.24] he talks about you even outside the house. I am not saying that
[444.52] there was anything between you two, but there was definitely some kind of emotion which did
[451.80] not allow her to think about anything else. However, it also happens that
[457.36] we are not able to recognize our emotions with Shahram. Look,
[464.80] Sahid, try to understand what I say. Look, whatever Shahram is going to do, its
[469.84] outcome is not good. Life is not just about marriage. Age
[475.48] is much bigger than that. There is much more beyond that.
[480.16] Look, more than the wife. A man needs a lot
[485.11] [Music] And I
[488.96] am not able to explain my point to you and Shahram is not ready to listen to me, you tell him that I
[494.44] cannot marry him and remove this thought from your mind.
[504.48] [Music]
[519.79] [Music] Shia
[531.20] Ram She did not agree and I understand that you
[537.72] cannot marry someone
[550.60] forcefully Na la ra ra
[561.28] ra na [Music]
[568.55] [Applause] Hello hello assalaam alaikum alaikum salam
[578.68] kaun ji woh zaira biwi se baat ho Who are you speaking? What work do you have?
[586.84] Yes, I am a state agent. He had talked about the potion at home. I
[592.16] have seen it. I have to take time from him for tomorrow so that I can show him that potion. Is there
[597.32] anyone here? Don't take the potion, please come, don't call me, but Zara B
[604.52] had said [music]
[615.88] If it is too much, but I will bring you peace in such a way that you will keep thinking that this
[621.32] will be worth lakhs, good
[627.05] [music] Yes, Salam, welcome talk. Hey, Chanda
[634.48] has fallen, quickly bring the car, hurry up,
[638.68] I will go and get Shaji, go brother, come again, come again, Ya Allah Khair
[650.58] [Music] Scene If something happens to Chanda, I am
[665.36] on the day of doomsday What will I show to Lara, that's why I used to tell her not to give birth to this child
[671.68] [Music] Find out what
[680.64] happened, just pray, everything will be fine Why aren't you bringing this out
[688.33] [Music]
[700.03] [Music]
[706.96] I was about to call you for food Eat [Music]
[712.32] Take, I am not hungry
[717.54] [Music]
[738.32] Sit, I had biscuits with tea in the evening, I am really not hungry,
[744.56] sit
[748.16] please
[755.80] [Music]
[794.74] [Music]
[844.00] [Music]
[866.36] Jairam, sit, I want to talk to you [Music]
[882.52] Why are you troubling yourself? I like that you
[888.16] are worried for me, but this is not the way to get me out of trouble. You
[892.48] start thinking about marriage [music]
[895.60] This is not your problem,
[902.96] you are the solution to my problem. Are you mad? Neither am I mad nor can a child understand my own good or bad.
[910.20] I know what will be the outcome of the decision of my case. Now please don't say this
[915.04] because you are older than me and hence this marriage cannot happen.
[920.36] It's fine. I have no love for you. I did not make big promises but I do
[925.40] know who is important for me and who is not important.
[929.44] You are very intelligent Shahram, you understand things, that is why I have a request from you that you
[935.48] will not take any decision without thinking. Look world. If we live in this world,
[941.76] we have to listen to the words of the people of the world. Many times people will talk, then
[948.12] why are you afraid? I am not afraid of anyone, that is why I do not want to marry out of fear.
[954.52] I know this Shahram that I cannot marry you.
[959.56] I respect your spirit. I believe that you
[966.40] have been useful to me in all my good and bad times. I also appreciate that I have got used to you. Maybe you too, no
[972.52] marriage. [Music]
[977.92] Shahram. Look, if you say, I will. I will not go from here, I will stay here,
[985.16] I will counter the words of all those people, okay, when they see that there
[990.56] is nothing like this between us, then they will automatically become silent, but you
[998.88] will not marry
[1004.00] me, why no? Am I very bad?
[1008.84] There are many flaws in me, can't I support you, can't I give you the happiness
[1013.16] that is your right? Look here, look at me, now tell me what is lacking
[1021.68] in me, there is no flaw in you, you are very good, that is why I want you. That
[1028.28] you should marry a good girl. A good girl
[1033.16] is only one who is younger than me, whether she knows me or not after marriage.
[1037.64] Whether our life is good or bad, it is very emotional. How can I explain
[1044.04] to you? Look, you had insisted earlier also that it was not for Chanda, but then you have forgotten her.
[1050.24] If you are considering my decision to marry Chanda as emotional, then you are calling this decision of mine emotional.
[1055.04] So this is very wrong and if you are refusing because of Chanda,
[1059.44] I am not refusing because of Chanda, I am just telling you that
[1065.20] a man can take emotional decisions at any age and
[1069.88] neither your parents will accept this decision. Neither people, nor do I care about my parents,
[1076.32] nor about people, in my world there is only you,
[1083.16] why don't you understand, only you [music]
[1092.92] I can't marry you, then listen to my decision too,
[1102.16] I too will not marry all my life. I will do
[1127.32] it
[1138.88] [
