It is not about the relationship, she was kicking her out of the house, I am telling you, you are spoiling her. Okay, stop it now. No Chanda Auntie, there is no such thing, it is all just a misunderstanding, this whiskey is getting angry for no reason.  Ignore it, don't fight like this. Wow sister, you maintained a good friendship, you ended years of friendship in one day, we have relation, no one can break it. Hema Auntie, there is no relation between us. I am not marrying Zarka. Look, how he is talking and you all had come here to break my daughter's engagement. Don't talk nonsense Hema, it's Zarka's mistake. She has no right to kick her out of my house.  And relationships are not made by force, She will marry Guddu forcibly? Think yourself, how can he break the relationship that was fixed in childhood?  Don't talk nonsense, accept that you have done wrong. I am not wrong. I'm telling you Lafray, tell that whiskey if he ever even looked at another girl, I will take out his eyes. Stop it no need to be Juliet. You keep quiet or I will break your mouth. Mind your language Don't take it out someone else anger on me. Shameless, bastard, why did you go there?  You are also scolding me? Ask her, why did she go there? What has she done there? It's not her father's supremacy that she will go and throw out their guests. I will throw them. I'll see how she lives there. She has gone completely mad. What has she done, that whiskey has lost his mind, he said no for marrying her. Hema Bai, actually Guddu has not accepted this relationship all his life, he has said it many times, break the relationship, follow my advice and end this all  and talk about business. The second thing is that make Zarka understand Guddu, is doing business with Rani. Are you listening Zarka? I'll check her. Leave her, she is young Who do you want to meet? I want to meet Hema Bai. Whisky has sent, it's my wedding. Want to get someone for dance. Whiskey has sent here? There is no one here to do dance. Go from here. But he said, you do dance. I don't dance. Now go from here. Wasting time by standing here. What are you saying? Shut up and why are you standing there listening to our conversation? Your ears not working? Go from here. I'll talk to him. What you did? Wait I'll go and   tell mother.  Mother What happened? Why are you screaming? Mother, a man came to organise function in his wedding function and she scolded  and sent him away.  Just because Whiskey had sent him. Zarka, you have gone mad, and you know that Lafrah is running a shop, you will make us starve. I will not not make you starve.I will find someone. Why you did not stopped her? What would I do? She scolded him and sent him away. Oh God, what a problem, you girls have ruined my life. I check this Zarka Whisky, I trust you that's why I had come here, but as soon as they heard your name, they said to me, get lost from here. Whatever, sort out the issue Mixi. I am already in tension, Sir, you are my customer I respect you a lot. My name is Whisky, not Mixi. Its Whisky or Mixi, whatever. Make it quick. You wait here, don't go, I'm coming in no time. Come quickly. I'm coming  What he think of himself? He knows well that I love him. He takes advantage of this every time, now I will not listen to him. Even if he falls in my feet, never What is wrong? Why did you come here? Go to your favourite one. You have no relation with me, now all relations are with her. She is your new affair. I don't have any affair with her, have you gone mad? Then why did you say in front of her that I am not your fiancee? [music] Let's end this discussion. You have no realisation that how much I love you? Look Zarka, love is nothing, everything is fake. You haven't learned lesson from my mother? She have been waiting for your lover for a long time. he didn't turn back. That was a different thing. He was an outsider, so he never returned Where you will go? Don't trust me too. Who knows, I should go somewhere. Don't talk nonsense, Whiskey, I have been waiting for you since childhood. I swear you are wasting your time. Look, I have no intention of getting married right now, I will tell you when it happens, you tell me that why you said no to customer? For a single party you and Rani will get 10 thousand each. Look, ignore fight but don't kick on business and nowadays who pays for dancing this much money Okay, listen, let's end the matter. Okay, but on one condition, there is no need of talking to that wretched. I will not talk to her. Hema Auntie. Hey, what happened? why are you making noise? I am sending some men, Zarka has to go to the party tomorrow and listen Pari, tomorrow is your party too and auntie, talk to the men about money, I said 10 thousand for Rani and Zarka. What? Rani will also go? I just explained. So everything is fine. Hey, Whiskey, you have talked to her? Yes, we have talked.   Listen, be ready tomorrow. Hey whiskey, I will also take 10 thousand. Will see. Oh, I beat you. Now move this one. Hey, play your game I won't call you Whisky I don't like it. Hey, I like it very much Now will you call me Guddu? Mother calls me Guddu. Your name is Sheriyar? I'll call you Sheriyar. Whatever you want, you can call me. You won't feel nice? When you will call then I will know. No one has ever called you,Sheriyar? No! Who will call me? Tell me one thing, have you ever loved anyone? No, I never felt that anyone is important for me. Then Zarka? She is crazy. But she loves you? Otherwise who fight like this for anyone. She fights with everyone, you will stay for a few days, you will come to know everything, I told you that my aunt Zeenat fixed this relation before dying  and Zarka is still stuck with the same relationship since childhood and listen don't mind her words, I don't have any plans of marrying her. But you will marry someone? someone you will like, you will also fall in love with someone. No one yet. If you look around you, you will see it. Rani, I know everything, this love is not for women living on brothel, courtesan never loves anyone. Shehryar, music is an art, courtesan does something else. We don't do anything like this, nothing like this happens here and you don't say courtesan, Everyone has a heart, everyone has right to love. Everyone does not get this right My mother also loved my father very much. It was so much that she kept sitting in his name all her life, and what she got? Me? Rani, I don't want to fall in love with anyone and get myself sick. Hey, tell me, are you not in love with anyone? Yes, now it seems that I am liking someone. Where did you bring me? Hey friend, you come out, it's already late, Whisky, he will take you inside, I am leaving when you are done from here, they will drop you back. Hey friend, you also come with me. I told you that I have to go for another work, then I will meet you later, take him, go. Come Sir Go, take him inside [Music]  [Music] [Music] You sit inside, I will call Madam [Music] How much money they have! I don't know how much money he has spent over  Is there anything inside [Music] Your name is Whiskey? Although my name is Shehryar but everyone calls me Whisky [Music] For the first time I realised, what is love. World becomes beautiful in love, and I realised how much you have love me It's been years and now you have realised. At least I realised, now forgive me.  You slapped me in front of Rani and now you are apologising in private. Come on, I will apologise to you in front of Rani Don't doubt me. There is no affair between me and Rani I just felt bad that you should not have behaved the way you did with the guests. Look, time forces anyone, poor helpless woman, you should not have done this. Now, when you will show interest in Rani, I will get angry. Hey, you have gone mad. Listen, I took the help of Rani and Neelam Aunty  only because on this pretext mother allows me to enter the house, otherwise you know that she does not show her face. After all, she is my mother. I can't even sleep after before her. You don't like it, mother sits in front of me and talks, doesn't call me bad, and you are doubting me for such a simple thing. Now come, I will make you friend with mother Who are you making her friend with Whiskey? Aunty, Zarka have a fight with Rani Tell me one thing, how can people live together after fighting? Those poor ladies don't even have any other place to go. That's why I am asking her to be friend. You are right, Zarka go, Rani is a very nice girl and you know,  She was so sad that because of her you both had a fight. Hey go with him, I have apologised too aunt, now please forgive me. Go ahead, she forgives you.  Our Zarka is not crazy to fight for no reason. Hey Zarka, go my dear, go and apologize to Chanda Aunty, you have behaved very badly with her guests, Okay I am going now why are you all standing here Come Pari, there is some household work pending, get the work done with me. In evening Whiskey will bring customers. Definitely I will bring Come with me Now tell me how much you love me? so much that you can't even imagine. Well then this is the thing.
