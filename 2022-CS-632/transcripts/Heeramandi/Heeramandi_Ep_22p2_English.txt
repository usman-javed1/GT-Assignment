[Music] What's the problem? Why did you call me? Pari, you have to do something for me. What? You find out and tell me if Zarka wants to come back here or not. I already know that. She doesn't want to come. Don't tell yourself; ask her and let me know. I called her thrice. She hung up. Hey, tell her that because of her, Auntie's husband hit me. Forget her. You do one thing. Say to her to leave everything and come back. Hey Whiskey, Don't talk like this. And Mom heard it, he gave you one slap. Mom will at least give you 3  or 4 slap. And that face of yours, which is like a hero's, will get spoiled. Why are you getting involve in this issue? Forget it, man. Forget this issue. Do one thing for me. Hey, listen. I'm listening, go on.  Arrange a meeting for me with any handsome guy,  he must be rich   Don't make this face. Hey, Is there someone in your sight? Yes, Lafrah is here. Hey, I am not kidding. Go away, everyone thinks about themselves. No one cares about me. Sister, if you had any work, you could have called me. No, no, just sit down. I just want to say that whatever happened today has happened, make sure this does not happen again. Sister, I said it won’t happen again. I have said to my mom and my sister as well. They never come either.   Okay. You haven't eaten, so go ahead and eat. No, sister. I'm not hungry.  I'm not feeling well. What happened to your health? Are you feeling something? Yes, sister. Tell me, what are you feeling? Sister When I cry. Yes, yes.  I get headache, and I'm still having a headache. Okay, that's fine. I was saying that whatever happened today, don't tell Murad.  He is already upset. If he finds out, he will get even angrier. Yes, sister, I swear by Allah. Now you won't have any trouble from me or my family. Okay. Asalam alikum, sister. Walikum asalam.   You had your breakfast? Yes, I have. And you? Sister, I was very hungry in the morning because I didn't eat at night.  Get ready; you need to come with me for a bit.   Where do we need to go? Sister, you’re not going to drop me home, are you? No, there's no need to worry. We will be back in an hour. Yes doctor sir, I want to get her pregnancy test. Okay, Who is she to you? Yes, she is my cousin's wife.  How many days has it been since their wedding? Yes, 5 days. No, no. It's been more than 5 days. But what difference does it make? By the test we can find out if it's positive or negative? Yes, we can find out.  you people in such a hurry to have a child? Everyone wants to have a baby, this is the only reason, Where were you? You go inside. Shumail, I am asking something? At the doctor's. Why? Is everything okay? To get Zarka's pregnancy test, is it positive or negative? You have gone crazy. How can her test be positive? What do you mean by that?  There is no relationship between us. What? [Music]  What? Well, that means all the suffering you’ve endured for so many days has been completely in vain.  So, it's because of you, if on the first day you hadn't created any trouble, the result would have been positive by now. And after the result is positive, he wouldn't go to her, right?  You are absolutely right, Auntie. I agree that the mistake is mine. But I promise, I will do exactly as you say. Look, Shumail, I don't want to give you any advice again. And then you again create a scene. And Sharam has firmly forbidden me to get involved in this matter now.  This will not happen at all now. I also want that when so much has been done, there should be some reward for it. You know Murad and his nature. He can't live his whole life without seeing his parents. It's just a few days; the anger will go away. And then you know, I have the same torment of being childless. Yes, that's it. Look, if you understand the matter, then talk to Murad first. Assure him that you won't fight with him anymore. Explain to him that the purpose of bringing Zarka into this house was to have children. And also, treat Zarka like a family member. She must be a little scared because of your behavior, right? Involve her with you. The three of you should sit together and eat. In fact, if possible, take her for some outing. If you don't do this, how will there be a bond between the two of them? Now, this is what I have to do. It's just a matter of once, Shumail. Who knows, maybe Allah will fulfill your wish in just one go. Okay. Do talk to Murad. I will. [Music] I'm sorry, it was my mistake. Yes, it was your mistake. Yes, I have accepted it, Send her back. Look, whatever deprivation Allah has given. Accept it. No, Murad, God has put this thought in my heart. That's why everything has happened so easily. Otherwise, we had no other option. Now think that we could have children this way. Shumail, you please, Murad, please. Okay, I promise. I won't fight anymore; I won't say anything. And then think for yourself. It's unfair to Zarka as well. She is married, and... Okay, that's enough. The truth is that I am not able to accept all of this. I know why you are not able to. But please, everything is fine now, right? Please. Please trust me for my sake. Shumail, I have done everything for your sake. So for everything else, please do it for my sake. Well, I can see how much you love me. I am asking reward for this love. You are very foolish. You took the girl to the hospital. You could have asked me once. What would that girl be thinking? Yes, that's true. I didn't even think about it. She was also very surprised, as if she wanted to say something to me I did'nt listen. You're an idiot.Yes, I am. Turn off the lights, Let's go to sleep now.   Yes Pari, how are you? I am fine. How is mom? Okay. Do you know she took me to the hospital yesterday? Hospital. Why did she take you to the hospital? She thought I was going to be a mother. Really? You’re going to be a mother? No, how would I become? He doesn’t even talk to me. Until now, he hasn’t even touched me. Oh no! Then why did she take you to the hospital? You didn’t tell her. She didn't listen to me This is not a marriage, you can't give birth like this. By the way, the fact is I'm very happy like this. You’re crazy! Oh, if you want to stay there, then don’t hesitate to confront him. I can't do it. I'm really scared of Shumail. If she takes any of my words the wrong way, she will throw me out of the house. Okay, forget it. Now put the phone down. And don’t tell mom all my things. She would get upset. Okay, fine. If you say so, I won’t tell. But remember one thing, Zarka. He has married you. You are his wife. You also have some rights over him. Give me the phone. What are you saying, Zarka? Oh, he has married you. Why hasn’t he come to you? So what, mom, atleast I got married right? I am in my husband's house. Why are you worried? Isn’t it enough that I am happy here! I want to stay here. It feels good. Mom, if she is happy then why are you worried about her? Shumaila are you there? Yeah, Good evening. Hii. Listen, I am very hungry. Quickly serve the food; I will just get fresh. Murad I didn’t cook today. What? Why? Because I was in the mood to eat out today. Not bad. You get ready. I'll come down after freshening up. I am ready. Give me the car keys. I will be waiting for you downstairs. You know what, I was so hungry that I was thinking of calling  you to tell you to keep food ready. But anyway, I am coming [Music] [Music]  Do one thing, serve appetizers quickly. Okay. You want anything else? No! Excuse me Excuse me. What happened? Why you have bandage? My hand got burned. How? I was cooking the curry, the oil spilled on my hand. Why didn’t you tell? There was nothing to tell about this. It was just a little burn. Did you tell Shumail? Yes. That’s why food couldn't be prepared at home today. Her hand is burned. Yes, I said to her, should have told me. But she told me after tying the bandage. She is saying it’s just a little burned, not too much. You applied something on it? Yes. Mom says if you apply toothpaste or cream on a burn, it helps relieve the pain. So I applied toothpaste and then bandaged it. Okay, let’s go home and show me.
