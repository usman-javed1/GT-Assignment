[2.87] Are you Chanda?
[12.72] Just answer my one question
[22.02] Do you have the answer to my question?
[32.71] Chanda, please
[37.33] Please, Chanda, listen to me
[41.11] [Music]
[50.37] [Music]
[65.08] Just pray, Mom, that I stay here forever
[69.29] Hey Zarka, take Murad's wife in your grip, then see. Mom, I try a lot.
[78.00] But she always finds something to say. She must be jealous of you.
[83.63] You stay quiet; you keep saying whatever comes in your mouth.
[92.52] Assalam alekum ji, walikum salaam. Many congratulations to you. Thank you so much
[99.72] Zarka, do you need anything? No, sister. Asalam alikum. Walikum salam,
[106.03] I brought a cake with tea. Congratulations to you, Murad brother.
[113.44] Yes son, many congratulations to you, this is a very happy news. Thank you 
[119.56] Congratulations to you all as well. Murad brother, our aunt came along too.
[124.24] She is sitting in the drawing room, can we call her here too? Yes, you all should come.
[129.16] Tea is ready. Everyone come to the lounge. Yes, please come.
[135.31] [music]
[145.65] Hey Zarka, ever since I heard this good news, believe me.
[150.97] I can't sleep out of happiness. I'm so happy. Mom, baby will call me Aunt Pari?
[156.38] Off course. If he takes Zarka's features, he will be very beautiful.
[162.31] And what, Murad? Sorry, your aunt is not in the drawing room, nor is she outside anywhere.
[169.12] What? She was just downstairs. Oh, where did she go? She might have gone home.
[176.75] Oh, how can she leave alone like that? Mom, the tea is served, let’s drink the tea.
[190.55] Shumail. Come, sit, please come, sit.

[212.64] [Music] 
[238.13]  Chanda, oh chanda
[243.08] Is everything okay with Zarka? Why are you crying?
[254.33] Shehram was there.
[263.34] I know. That's why I was stopping you from going there.
[270.00] By the way, that Shehram doesn't live at Murad's house, Hema was telling.
[276.39] Hema was saying that there is no man there except Murad. Tell me one more thing, that aunt who came...
[283.96] She was Shehram's wife. I know.
[290.19] That's why I ran away from there without telling anyone.
[295.39] Nothing has been discussed. Is there something to talk about?
[302.96] But today I felt like all my wounds have become green.
[312.61] Stop crying. Hey Chanda, what will you say to Neelam and Rani if they come?
[320.04] Why are you crying?
[323.80] Forget it, just promise me.
[329.84] Never tell Guddu that Shehram is his father. Chanda, I won’t tell but
[335.96] Guddu has stabbed him. Did Guddu, stabbed his father?
[344.89] Why didn't you tell me earlier? I will kill him. Guddu
[350.01] was killing his father? What you tell him that he is his father?
[360.00] Guddu should never find out that Shehram is his father. Never! 
[367.25] Habib, leave me alone now, go away from here.
[373.40] Oh Chanda, I have left you alone all my life.
[379.98] If I leave you alone now, what will I do by myself? 
[384.93] Just go!. Hey Chanda, you’ve spent your whole life in crying.
[394.59] And what will you do by crying again? Just go, leave me alone.
[413.45] [Music]
[420.96]  [Music]
[488.20] Was this the first meeting after many years or a meeting after many meetings?
[497.85] What do you want to say?
[503.20] I am not saying whatever I want to say
[509.39] I am just asking. Just say whatever you want to say.
[523.33] You will bare what I want to say?
[538.94] You say it, I just want to hear that.
[549.98] This is called betrayal, right, Shehram? That love was indeed a betrayal.
[556.61] which is done while keeping other in the dark.
[560.52] One's own face is hidden and the other person's face is not seen either.
[566.47] I have never loved you while keeping you in the dark.
[572.75] I saw her after many years at Murad's wedding and then again now.
[579.56] But maybe all this time has been spent in search of her.
[586.29] There is no difference between being with someone's presence and being with their thoughts.
[599.52] Zaira please listen to me .
[615.25] I just didn't feel like staying there, so I left. It's that simple.
[619.43] Oh, what's there to feel attached about? The way those people stopped you, I felt very bad.
[625.93] But I don't understand why that woman stopped you. What was she saying, what was she talking to you about?
[634.37] She just said that I will explain to Guddu and Habib that they don't need to come there.
[641.09] Guddu has been very rude to them, and he has also said that we shouldn't come every day.
[650.21] We don't go there everyday? And who is that woman to stop us?
[655.60] Shumail said that we can come and meet whenever we want.
[660.64] Think about it yourself. She can't say it on your face.
[665.36] Anyway, I told her that we don't have the time to come every day.
[672.21] You tell me how is Zarka? She is very happy.
[677.27] In fact, Murad even sent a cake. But where are Neelam and Rani?
[684.46] They have gone out somewhere, now they must be about to come back.
[688.64] By the way Chanda, I was really worried about how you will reach home alone?
[693.80] You know, if I were in your place, I would do the same.
[697.66] Next time when we go, you come with me. Then I'll see how she stops you.
[703.57] Leave this, it's not time to fight. 
[709.00] Okay, do this: come to my house and have dinner today.
[712.86] Also have some cake. And bring Rani and Neelam with you too
[716.68]  Okay. I've told Lafrah.  Alright, I'm leaving now.
[724.09] [music]
[741.05] Murad, come here, I want to show you something.
[745.86] Look at this. These are names of boys and girls. Tell me which name you like the most from these.
[752.64] Just look closely. How do we know if it's a boy or a girl?
[756.65] May it be a boy. Your parents' wish will also be fulfilled. They need an heir.
[762.00] And when Allah has heard so many prayers, He will hear this one too.
[767.18] Oh yes. In fact, I was just thinking about getting Zarka's name registered there at the hospital.
[773.07] Now there will be regular check-ups for her, right? Yes, you should get it registered tomorrow.
[776.64] Yeah, so you should come too. What will I do there?
[781.11] After that, we'll go shopping for the baby. For which, baby boy or baby girl?
[787.12] We'll buy for both, we will do window shopping, check out cots, and toys.
[795.70] Okay, now look at these names.
[808.09] Mom, I'm wondering whose face the baby will resemble.
[815.13] Oh, how would I know? Let me sleep. Mom, he will look cute like me, right?
[822.15] Oh, why would it look like you? It will look like its mother or father.
[828.32] What's this? You said I resemble my aunt
[832.28] So, he will look like me. Oh, my Lord.
[837.26] Oh, I will pray to Allah that he resembles you. Now let me sleep.
[842.13] Mom, I can't sleep.
[844.32] Mom, we'll go shopping tomorrow, okay? And we'll buy a lot of things for the baby.
[850.01] One more stupid idea!
[854.06] Oh, my mom used to say that there's no point in shopping 7-8 months in advance.
[861.23] Oh, come on, Mom. Don't talk about old times.
[864.82] I’m going shopping tomorrow. Oh, Whisky, where were you and why didn’t you come for dinner?
[872.09] There’s a cake kept for you; Murad brother sent it to sweeten your mouth.
[876.00] Get lost! I don't want to sweeten my mouth.
[879.16] And Hema Aunty, you tell me. Why did you leave her there?
[883.42] Oh, come here, Whisky. Sit here. Oh, just sit down, sit
[891.75] I don't understand this. What are you worried about?
[896.49] Oh, if there’s no issue there, no fighting, then why do we bring her?
[901.68] You know one thing, Zarka is expecting.
[905.85] She is expecting. He has given a divorce. Now she is being held against her will.
[911.21] I found out everything. They took her to the hospital in the middle of the night; she was unconscious.
[918.00] And you all left her there like a bunch of fools. Are you in your senses?
[921.96] They took her to the hospital because she was unwell.
[924.83] There was no fight, no issue, you understand? Now what are you worried about?
[930.00] She's, my fiancé. Are you out of your mind? You have no relation with her.
[936.27] Look who's claiming to be a fiancé. Oh, you sold her, got it!
[941.53] Don't mess with my mind, get out of here.
[944.96] This all is a lie. I doubt the baby is even not going to happen.
[948.40] Pari, you call her, I want to talk to her.
[950.87]  Beware, Pari, if you call her. Do you understand?
[954.42] Call from your own phone. She's, not answering my phone. Why would she answer yours?
[960.00] You've acted so rudely at her house. And you are rude to Zarka too.
[964.49]  She has said that you won't set foot in her house or call her. Do you understand?
[969.22] Don't mess with me. Oh, just let my girl live.
[973.10]  She cannot live there. Just see how they kick her out of the house!
[977.76] Oh, the dust in your mouth. Stop talking nonsense.
[982.12] Oh, Whisky, are you going to get scolded by Mom? Just go from here.
[985.53] Oh, he won't leave like that; he’ll leave after getting kicked out. Get out of here, just go
[991.94] Damn it! Oh, you really embarrassed her.
[997.33] She kept feelings for him in her heart. She had dreams with him
[1002.15]  I don't know what he will do now.
[1007.46] Mom, he won't do anything. He'll be like this for a couple of days, and then he'll be fine on his own.
