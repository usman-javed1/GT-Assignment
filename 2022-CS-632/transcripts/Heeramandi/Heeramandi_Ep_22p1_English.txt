Now tell me what should I do, I had explained all this to her, even Zara aunty had tried to make her understand but at that time she did not listen to anyone Everyone has tried to make her understand but the issue is that Murad she is very afraid of divorce, this is the reason she is doing these stupid things.  Murad, why don't you make your parents understand that  it is not in our hands to have children.  If she had not been afraid of divorce,   she would never have taken such a big risk. I have already told her that I will never divorce her and I look so crazy to you that I would take this step just because my parents are saying? Despite knowing all this, Shumail crucified me. What does she want now? What can she want? A wife under her own roof do not want to see her husband's other wife. Then why did she do all this? Why did she make a show of me? Just to ensure that she does not get divorced, she has fulfilled her wish. You have no idea what is happening to me. She put restrictions on my movement in the house, on my coming and going, on eating and drinking. What is the meaning of all these things? Look Murad, I myself not able to understand what she wants and what you should do? but whatever you do, do it thoughtfully. So what do you say, what should I do now? It is better if you don't ask me because I am very confused myself, rather you ask yourself what do you want? [Music] Why have you come here? Asalam alikum  Madam. I have come to meet Zarka. She won't meet anyone. Why won't she meet? Because I don't want to. There was a clear discussion with her mother that neither will she meet anyone nor will anyone come to meet her. Then why have you come here? Look, this was not discussed. I did not talk to you. It is better that you leave from here. I will not leave without meeting Zarka. Zarka is not allowing us to meet. Tell him to get away from here, otherwise I will throw you out along with him. How will you throw me out like this? If there was a deal and then you will have to pay the full amount. Why have you come? Go away from here. Zarka, you don't need to be afraid of them. Stop talking nonsense, go away. Get out of here, otherwise you will get pushed out by the servants Okay Madam, I will not come again. Give me number of auntie with whom the deal was made. Get out of here and don't dare to come here again. Understand? Go! What is this all? This is not your in-laws house where your family members will come to meet you whenever they feel like it. Say to them, don't step in this house again  Otherwise I will throw you out. Your marriage with Murad is our compulsion. You have not been married, you have been bought. Never forget this Why have you come here? I have come to talk to you! What do you want to talk to me? This is the deal with you that we did not handed over Zarka to you forever. When Hema auntie went to take her, that lady did not send her and when I went, she did not allow me to meet her. I had forbidden her to go, this deal was done with me. and it was decided that she would not go back after she came here, Don't talk nonsense, yes, we had sold Zarka, not buried, you guys are not owning your words, you come with me and send her with me. I will drop her in the evening, Go from here otherwise it will be very wrong. What will go wrong? Don't threaten me, What happened? What are you saying? You stay out of this matter sir. we had deal with madam. Are you in your senses, this is a house of noble people not prostitution area. Prostitution areas are also lighted by people like you, Sir, prostitute fulfils your needs,  they are useful for your barren women. Shut Up! Out! [Music]   Hi Zaraka, I was thinking about you, you have a long life. Whiskey came there? are you coming? Don't talk nonsense, that wretched person came here, I am not coming. I want to talk to mother. Okay, Mother, Zarka is on the phone. Oh Zarka, I am coming, tell me what happened, so why you want to talk to mother?  Give me the phone. Hello Why did Whisky come here? Why did you send him here? If you did not send him, then why did he come here, why do you people want to make my life miserable, I did not send anyone there. I warned, Whiskey not to step there. Zarka dear, you should apologise to Shumail, tell her that now no one from this house will come there, I will take notice of Whiskey, if those people say, then we too will not come to meet you, it's okay, don't worry, Khuda Hafiz [Music] He will not leave my daughter, he will destroy her house [Music] You come with me Lafray, I will put that  bastard in jail in the kidnapping case. Who has been kidnapped, what case? In Zarka's case, who else. Have you gone mad, go from here, you yourself have done it, Hey, who says on which paper it is written? Which stamp paper I signed? I am telling you. There is no paper of law, today I will report, tomorrow everyone will be in jail. Hey Guddu, don't talk non sense. It's not non sense. a fire inside me. I will not leave him, he slapped me here. I will not spare him. What is his name? He is some relative of Murad. Lady who came here to finalise the deal, he is her husband. Hey Guddu, I am not well. Hey, buy a drink for Guddu, I don't want anything. Leave this. Spit it out my dear, oh what happened, Don't touch me. He hit me here, I will not leave him, I am telling you. Hey dear, leave this all  They are rich people, if he hit you then it doesn't matter. I will hit that bastard very hard. Hey Guddu, you are scaring me, what has happened to you? This is the result of your sympathy, I told you that all this will happen, all good and bad will fall on your neck, those people to whom God does not give troubles, they themselves buy troubles and you have crossed the limits, that you reached the brothel, even a man can't imagine ... You loved Shumail a lot? You have done enough for her, now tell her that I will not tolerate her stupidity, and solve her house matters by herself. Murad is also fed up. He came to me, he is not a stupid man. Although he did not say anything to me, but he must be definitely putting all the blame on you, enough is enough. Let's end this all here. That's it! [Music]  [Music] Look Lafray, my mind is not in control, I will do whatever my heart desires, don't try to make me understand. Where are you taking me? Shut up and sit in the rickshaw, Just listen to me, you will fight there? I will not fight, I will beat the bastard  I will hit him hard. You have gone crazy. Sit in Rickshaw  Be gentle, dear. Don't be so angry, just get relax look listen to me, don't do like this.  Oh how do I know, I didn't even listen to him. I was coming out of the room there were noisy sounds then he went away, started his rickshaw, took Lafrah and went out. Amma told this to me. Mother abused Whiskey for going to Zarka's house and he also argue said but if he takes Lafrah to Zarka's house  He didn't do well. Now who knows where he has gone, what will he do? And you know Chanda Aunty is worried about him. Leave it, God will make everything fine, I have brought cloth for the new suit and I will show it to you, You sit, I am coming. A new dress? Baji, I apologize to you. I promise that no one will come in the future, Baji, whatever it is, it is not even my fault. It is your fault, you should have refused everyone when There was a discussion with your mother that no one will come here, so he reached here, after that he reached aunty's house? I had told him in front of you that he should go away, Okay, go to your room now, now you have refused. At that very moment I had called mother and told her that no one should come here. Yes, it's okay, now go, don't stand here and take care next time. You saw within four-five days so many troubles have arise. Yes, I can see how many troubles you have faced and I can also see how much loss you have caused in these five days, the loss of money, the fight with Murad, Sheram also scold me. and the tension that you yourself have raised, You did all this just to see this day? I have accepted my mistake, please tell Murad to end this story, divorce her and send her back. How many days have passed since this marriage? Four days, right? And during these four days Murad has also met her, I am not able to tolerate this, I have spent four days on the cross and you think that giving divorce is so easy? Imagine if she has become pregnant in these four days then? So quickly? You can find within 48 hours. Take her to a doctor and get her tested you will come to know.   And the fight between that the boy and Shehram don't tell Murad about this. Shehram was saying that he was already very upset that and this can make him more angry. I swear I won't tell. I swear I was feeling scared in the rickshaw, I prayed for only one thing all the way, that we don't meet him All life God has not listened to me, today he listened to me for the first time. You too are crazy, why you went with him. He forcibly took me with him By the way listen to me, you make him understand because if not today then tomorrow he will found that guy, then what will happen? He should cool down his anger, whatever is happening is his own doing and put one thing in his mind that Hema wants Zarka to stay there and happy. What do you think, I must not have tried to explain but he is mad with anger. Listen to me, why are you getting worried, don't worry, I will take care of him. Where he is now? He is downstairs, walking in anger. [music] Why did she turn off her phone?
