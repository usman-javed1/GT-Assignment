If a child is born then how will she abandon the child? It's a money game she is doing everything for the sake of money. I don't think so Anyway, a woman is the one who keeps even an illegal child close to her heart. She will leave her halal child there? Chanda, you are not sitting in the brothel, you are sitting in the well. You are a saint, you don't know what is happening around. Now a days mother through their children in well and runs away. No mother does this. They do this. Mother do this, I myself is example My mother left me in the garbage. Dogs were going to eat me. Some decent man picked me up and took me to his home. After a month, he also left me in the brothel. Now you understand? Be thankful that Zarka's child will be raise in a good family environment [Music] Hey Lafray, I am going to market to buy one new suit for myself, one gift for Zarka and one a dress for my mother, tell me, do you want anything? I don't want anything. At least wear something nice today. My earnings are not illegal. I don't want anything. Hey, why are you behaving rude? Looking, someone is getting married for the first time in this brothel Go and see they are starting function upstairs. By the way Lafrah, your luck did not support you, otherwise you would have done this long time ago. By convincing my mother. Hey, get lost you bastard! otherwise I will kill you. Hay, lafrah mind it. lafrah uncle mind this! Just wait .... Lafrah Uncle I will not spare you ... Lafrah uncle! Hey, come back! Calling his father uncle. I use to think that my girls get married and now they are getting married, the house is also getting settled, but to get destroyed. Don't think like this. Just pray that her house gets settled, My only prayer is that her house gets settled [Music]  Listen, stick to your promise, it is certain that sorrows are always in the foundation of our brothels, That is why I am scared, weird things are coming in my mind, I don't know whether her house will settle down or not? I don't know what will happen.  Murad will keep her happy or not? Don't think wrong, Inshallah, whatever happens will be good. This is the wedding house, and you are looking sad, Come on, smile now. This is the only song or are there more? There are more,. We have seen only one. Hey, what's going on, feed me some sweets too, Where were you? I had gone to buy a gift. Go and get a chair for yourself. [Music] Hey, look, I have brought a gift for you, I don't want anything, Hey, you are still angry? Look Zarka, whatever I did, is for your good fortune. Don't talk nonsense, whatever you did was to keep your money intact, you got your money, isn't it enough, It means you are not happy? Not your concern, I am happy or not.  Zarka, you can't understand right now what I have done, but later you will know that I have done best for you. If you are angry, stay angry, but keep my gift, I said, I don't want anything, I don't want to keep any memory of your's with me. You have gone crazy! [Music] [Music] How did you go there? Do you have any idea about that place? A woman like you cannot even think of going to that dirty place, men think before going there and you went there without thinking about it. Now it is not that dirty place and then those people do not make their daughters do any wrong work, This is what you are telling me, remember once I too had gone to the same place where you went today and what you said to me? If you go there even now, I will react in the same way. And you yourself went to those dirty streets to those dirty women for this stupid idea, by the way, where did you get this stupid idea from? This idea is disgusting. Is this justified to do to get a child? First marry a courtesan and then give birth to a child from her and adopt child. No matter how many people the courtesan has been with, She will not go there until the child is born. And with how many people she has been before? Is it easy to accept the child born to such woman? Nikkah will make that child legitimate, Shehram. And anyway, every person accepts his legitimate child with great pride, no matter courtesan gives birth to him. Whatever, I will not allow you to do this work. Now too much has happened, Shehram, the matter has gone too far, No matter how far the matter has gone, I will not allow you to do this work. Now it is your choice, you keep my words or! After coming back, the office problems are not yet solved, Now the problems have started at home. I just told you that I will not allow you and you will not go there. No, Shehram Shehram is very angry. He is not ready to listen to this, leave having a child, I don't understand how I will convince him, he is very upset with the fact that I  I went to those women in the dirty streets. I can understand why he is thinking like this, that is why I am finding it even more difficult to explain to him. Yes, now tell me what should we do? This is right. Yes, maybe he understands your point. Okay, yes He is at home at night. Yes, dinner time, okay [Music] [Song] [Song] Oh my prince, stay blessed! Here, open your mouth, eat well.  Mother see what I have brought. I enjoyed shopping so much. Greetings Auntie Greetings, Look, Auntie, I have taken these as per my choice look how beautiful these sandals are. Very good, very good, Hema Auntie, this is of my choice, how pretty it is? It is very nice. It will look nice on Zarka. Very nice colour. Mother, I have seen a dress, it is so beautiful, just give me 2000 more for that, Hema Auntie, where is the Zarka, I will show her me these clothes. Hey, wait, she is sleeping, show her later. Mother, I have brought something for her also. Show me, this one is matching with this one. It is very beautiful, now don't show her now, let her wake up Then show her in the evening. Asalamalaikum, come ... How is his mood? Come sit, Asalamalaikum. Walikum asalam. I think that have come at the right time. What's the matter, today you are ignoring me. I think I have disturbed you all by coming. No, it's not at all like that, eat the food, give her plate, please I already have a plate in front of me. Then start. I have come to meet you only, I know. Then you must also know why I came. I don't know whether you agree or not, but I feel that without children, life is exactly the same as the way we are sitting around this table and we are not able to understand what to talk about, how to start, how to communicate. You might not agree with the point because you are a man and can live without many things but perhaps a woman cannot do this. Are women born to have children only? I am not saying this but any woman cannot consider herself complete until she has a child in her womb. Why, Zaira, don't you consider yourself complete? In that life in which only me and you are present and there is no one else left. I became complete the day you held my hand, man. I need the company of a person, I have got that company The life of both of you is very different from the life of me and Murad, we both live under the same roof and keep searching for each other There is no one  in your life, but I have my in laws in my life There are questions in their eyes and these questions  cross my body, they wound me. My mother-in-law's desire, wounds my soul, insecurity surrounds me all the time. Don't know how long Murad and I will stay under one roof, don't know which moment will be the last moment between us. Will you tolerate a courtesan in your house? Yes, I will do it because I will keep her as a woman and a mother and not as a courtesan. In my house  You can see your husband under the same roof with a courtesan in another bedroom? Yes I can see because she is a courtesan or not from a good noble family, that later she becomes a compulsion for my husband. She is a woman with whom my husband is not ready to spend even one night, he cannot even think of spending his whole life with her. Do you think that your husband will accept that courtesan? This is the problem, that is why I need the help of both of you. Please, only two of you, apart from both of you, there is no one so close to me who can help me in my legitimate or illegitimate matters, on whom I can trust. Please, I need the help of both of you to convince Murad till the child comes in my lap, please. Will your in-laws accept the child born from courtesan? They will not know anything, they do not live in this country and what happens in my and Murad's life in a year and a half  They won't know. Please!
