[Music] [Music]  [Music]   [Music] [Music] [Music]  Husna Bai I swear to God, she was looking so healthy, she herself sit in the taxi and at the same time  Vodka give her hand like this She said, I don't want to hold, I swear by God, I am so happy to see Zeenat healthy, Allah knows. Thanks to Allah, just pray for my Zeenat to get back to health. By the way Auntie, Zeenat will be completely fine. Today when she woke up, there was a shine in her eyes. She was very happy. When I was dressing her up, I did not feel as if she was ill. I prayed that Zeenat would be fine than I will serve food in poor. I have serve, I have given money to Vodka, he has gone to shrine, after shrine, he will take her to the sea. I also prayed for Zeenat I gave Vodka money to put chadar to Babaji's shrine and will charity food there. May Allah accept this all. By the way Auntie Looking Zeenat like this, I felt as if without offering any charity or chadar, she will be fine. From your lips to God's ears. My Zeenat will be fine, I will light ghee lamps in the entire street. By the way Husna Bai, let me tell you one more thing. Zeenat has told Vodka that she is sick. Yes, she has said that if you come close to me, you will die.  But who told her? She has gone to the hospital several times to get herself checked. Someone must have told her, there are strange people there. Then it is okay. It's a very good thing that the poor girl has come to know that I mean she will spend the rest of her life happily. What's more, please hurry up, this is your work. Give me too, although it is sour, but from Chanda's hand, it is very sweet. Hey Chanda, you have never made food for us. serve this at least  [Music] [Music] [Music]   [Music] [Music] Yes Shehram, have you found? I said to you we appreciate someone only after his departure. Emotions do not end by hiding them; rather, emotions exist only to express them. A person searches for shade on a long journey in the scorching heat, and you want to leave shade and travel alone in that scorching desert? Can't I become that shelter under whose shadow you can live your life peacefully   Are you still afraid of people, will anyone ask you whether you are alive or not? What are you going through? Someone asked this question. Someone came and asked you need anything. I know this did not happen.  This did not happen People do not stay in one place like you. They move forward, I am the only one or are you the one who stopped at one place. I am very tired Zara. I am very tired, you are not tired? I am tired, I am so tired that I can't even live anymore, you have to live. Not for your loneliness but for me  Please  I have given charity at shrine. I have brought some for the house too, in this there is a shopper for Chambelli and Hema too. Mother, I am having a headache. You went to the sea, you like it, the air is salty, that's why you got a headache, I will press it, and look at it, she has gone crazy, she says that I have AIDS, I am going to die, and the doctors talk nonsense. Look at her face, dying face is like this? Don't talk like this. You have a very long life. Why are you lying mother? Why are you giving me false hope?  For all of us, the result would be the same, but if we were not doing all this work, I would be setting up my family raising children  like Chanda, my children would also be going to school I would be living a happy life. I would have lived at the age of 100. Don't talk like this, my heart will burst. Don't say such things, my child. Mother, promise me that you will stop Hema Don't put Zarqa in   this valley of death.  My soul will rest in peace. I finished my life in this dirty work no one else will get stuck in this the swamp. Promise me mother  I promise that I will not let any girl do this work again and see Vodka is not bringing customers any more no one will get a girl from here anymore. We will just do singing and dancing. Don't worry at all, you will be fine and I also promise that as long as I will stay alive, I will not let any customer touch any girl. You had promised me at night that you will not cry. You are crying again, You are also crying. We both are breaking our promise. No one will cry here. I am going, I have to arrange food for 40 people. Today is my Valima. How will this idiot get the Valima for 40 people? There are 10 people in the whole neighbourhood you will feed the rest to customers? I have invited some more people Don't worry Vodka, I have made arrangements. I have given the money to the hotel owner, he will feed food to 20 people, for 10 more he will home deliver. Arrangements are from my side. Oh dear, I love you. Zeenat, he is very lucky After so long, you went for some outing. He took you to the sea too? You must have enjoyed I have press your clothes wear them later, I will do makeup first.  Mother, I have to wear this dress. Yes, Mother you are making aunt a bride again? Yes, she looks beautiful as a bride. Yes, she looks very nice. Will you make Zarqa my bride? Have you gone mad? Again the same nonsense, you are not  getting married to Zarqa. Chanda... Do it. In this way, Zarqa will not die like me. I will marry Zarqa For my sake. Tomorrow is dinner for you at our house, I will make biryani for you. And tell me, what will you eat? Whatever you will make, I will eat.  Mother is marrying me to Zarqa. I am not lying. Zeenat Auntie also said. In this way Zarqa will be saved from dying like Auntie. I am going to tell Zarqa. Hey, bride is here. Come What have I said wrong? No, you said it absolutely right  Then promise me, you will get Zarqa married to Whisky? I promise but Chanda. Hema, I have agreed already. Zeenat wants the engagement to happen today. For my happiness if the engagement happens today  You said and consider it done. Not today, but now. I have bought sweets. [Song] [Song]
