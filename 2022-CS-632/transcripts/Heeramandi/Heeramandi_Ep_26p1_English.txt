[Music]  Are you Chanda? Just answer my one question Do you have the answer to my question? Chanda, please Please, Chanda, listen to me [Music] [Music] Just pray, Mom, that I stay here forever Hey Zarka, take Murad's wife in your grip, then see. Mom, I try a lot. But she always finds something to say. She must be jealous of you. You stay quiet; you keep saying whatever comes in your mouth. Assalam alekum ji, walikum salaam. Many congratulations to you. Thank you so much Zarka, do you need anything? No, sister. Asalam alikum. Walikum salam, I brought a cake with tea. Congratulations to you, Murad brother. Yes son, many congratulations to you, this is a very happy news. Thank you  Congratulations to you all as well. Murad brother, our aunt came along too. She is sitting in the drawing room, can we call her here too? Yes, you all should come. Tea is ready. Everyone come to the lounge. Yes, please come. [music] Hey Zarka, ever since I heard this good news, believe me. I can't sleep out of happiness. I'm so happy. Mom, baby will call me Aunt Pari? Off course. If he takes Zarka's features, he will be very beautiful. And what, Murad? Sorry, your aunt is not in the drawing room, nor is she outside anywhere. What? She was just downstairs. Oh, where did she go? She might have gone home. Oh, how can she leave alone like that? Mom, the tea is served, let’s drink the tea. Shumail. Come, sit, please come, sit. [Music] [Music]   Chanda, oh chanda Is everything okay with Zarka? Why are you crying? Shehram was there. I know. That's why I was stopping you from going there. By the way, that Shehram doesn't live at Murad's house, Hema was telling. Hema was saying that there is no man there except Murad. Tell me one more thing, that aunt who came... She was Shehram's wife. I know. That's why I ran away from there without telling anyone. Nothing has been discussed. Is there something to talk about? But today I felt like all my wounds have become green. Stop crying. Hey Chanda, what will you say to Neelam and Rani if they come? Why are you crying? Forget it, just promise me. Never tell Guddu that Shehram is his father. Chanda, I won’t tell but Guddu has stabbed him. Did Guddu, stabbed his father? Why didn't you tell me earlier? I will kill him. Guddu was killing his father? What you tell him that he is his father? Guddu should never find out that Shehram is his father. Never!  Habib, leave me alone now, go away from here. Oh Chanda, I have left you alone all my life. If I leave you alone now, what will I do by myself?  Just go!. Hey Chanda, you’ve spent your whole life in crying. And what will you do by crying again? Just go, leave me alone. [Music]  [Music] Was this the first meeting after many years or a meeting after many meetings? What do you want to say? I am not saying whatever I want to say I am just asking. Just say whatever you want to say. You will bare what I want to say? You say it, I just want to hear that. This is called betrayal, right, Shehram? That love was indeed a betrayal. which is done while keeping other in the dark. One's own face is hidden and the other person's face is not seen either. I have never loved you while keeping you in the dark. I saw her after many years at Murad's wedding and then again now. But maybe all this time has been spent in search of her. There is no difference between being with someone's presence and being with their thoughts. Zaira please listen to me . I just didn't feel like staying there, so I left. It's that simple. Oh, what's there to feel attached about? The way those people stopped you, I felt very bad. But I don't understand why that woman stopped you. What was she saying, what was she talking to you about? She just said that I will explain to Guddu and Habib that they don't need to come there. Guddu has been very rude to them, and he has also said that we shouldn't come every day. We don't go there everyday? And who is that woman to stop us? Shumail said that we can come and meet whenever we want. Think about it yourself. She can't say it on your face. Anyway, I told her that we don't have the time to come every day. You tell me how is Zarka? She is very happy. In fact, Murad even sent a cake. But where are Neelam and Rani? They have gone out somewhere, now they must be about to come back. By the way Chanda, I was really worried about how you will reach home alone? You know, if I were in your place, I would do the same. Next time when we go, you come with me. Then I'll see how she stops you. Leave this, it's not time to fight.  Okay, do this: come to my house and have dinner today. Also have some cake. And bring Rani and Neelam with you too  Okay. I've told Lafrah.  Alright, I'm leaving now. [music] Murad, come here, I want to show you something. Look at this. These are names of boys and girls. Tell me which name you like the most from these. Just look closely. How do we know if it's a boy or a girl? May it be a boy. Your parents' wish will also be fulfilled. They need an heir. And when Allah has heard so many prayers, He will hear this one too. Oh yes. In fact, I was just thinking about getting Zarka's name registered there at the hospital. Now there will be regular check-ups for her, right? Yes, you should get it registered tomorrow. Yeah, so you should come too. What will I do there? After that, we'll go shopping for the baby. For which, baby boy or baby girl? We'll buy for both, we will do window shopping, check out cots, and toys. Okay, now look at these names. Mom, I'm wondering whose face the baby will resemble. Oh, how would I know? Let me sleep. Mom, he will look cute like me, right? Oh, why would it look like you? It will look like its mother or father. What's this? You said I resemble my aunt So, he will look like me. Oh, my Lord. Oh, I will pray to Allah that he resembles you. Now let me sleep. Mom, I can't sleep. Mom, we'll go shopping tomorrow, okay? And we'll buy a lot of things for the baby. One more stupid idea! Oh, my mom used to say that there's no point in shopping 7-8 months in advance. Oh, come on, Mom. Don't talk about old times. I’m going shopping tomorrow. Oh, Whisky, where were you and why didn’t you come for dinner? There’s a cake kept for you; Murad brother sent it to sweeten your mouth. Get lost! I don't want to sweeten my mouth. And Hema Aunty, you tell me. Why did you leave her there? Oh, come here, Whisky. Sit here. Oh, just sit down, sit I don't understand this. What are you worried about? Oh, if there’s no issue there, no fighting, then why do we bring her? You know one thing, Zarka is expecting. She is expecting. He has given a divorce. Now she is being held against her will. I found out everything. They took her to the hospital in the middle of the night; she was unconscious. And you all left her there like a bunch of fools. Are you in your senses? They took her to the hospital because she was unwell. There was no fight, no issue, you understand? Now what are you worried about? She's, my fiancé. Are you out of your mind? You have no relation with her. Look who's claiming to be a fiancé. Oh, you sold her, got it! Don't mess with my mind, get out of here. This all is a lie. I doubt the baby is even not going to happen. Pari, you call her, I want to talk to her.  Beware, Pari, if you call her. Do you understand? Call from your own phone. She's, not answering my phone. Why would she answer yours? You've acted so rudely at her house. And you are rude to Zarka too.  She has said that you won't set foot in her house or call her. Do you understand? Don't mess with me. Oh, just let my girl live.  She cannot live there. Just see how they kick her out of the house! Oh, the dust in your mouth. Stop talking nonsense. Oh, Whisky, are you going to get scolded by Mom? Just go from here. Oh, he won't leave like that; he’ll leave after getting kicked out. Get out of here, just go Damn it! Oh, you really embarrassed her. She kept feelings for him in her heart. She had dreams with him  I don't know what he will do now. Mom, he won't do anything. He'll be like this for a couple of days, and then he'll be fine on his own.
