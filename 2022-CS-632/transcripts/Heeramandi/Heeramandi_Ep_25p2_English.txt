Keep quiet Lafray, No Zarka, I came to take you, you called at night, right? Yes, I did. Then why did you say that he has divorced you?

Go from here. Sir, he is short tempered. I say sorry on his behalf. It's okay. You don't worry, Madam Zarka is your's. You just take care of her, Obviously, we have to take care of her and you also don't worry at all. Sir, I don't his words. Come I will drop you till gate.  Sir, that Sheram Sir who met me, how do you know him? He is my wife's relative the aunt who got this marriage, He is her husband. Okay Why are you asking? Nothing sir, I met him a long time ago, I recognize him, he don't recognize me. Take care! I will manage, you don't worry. Zarka, did not come along with you? I brought you along so we can take Zarka back. You came here to fight, you bastard, I will leave you here, come back yourself. Don't talk non sense,  listen to me. Hey Guddu ... How you can leave me here, hey my child, I know, listen to me, see this Hey Guddu .... Asalam aleikum Sheram Brother, It's good that I found you here actually, Chanda had given a message for you ... Money ... You know that we have made a good deal with you, we have not cheated you at all, Don't talk non sense, I had given her money, she refused because she ... She refused because she wants, 20 instead of 10.  This was the reason, by the way, you never turned back. Lafra, tell me that Chanda is really waiting for Sheram, I mean last night she was waiting for Sheram or for someone else? She was waiting for him. She was definitely waiting. I mean, he had to give the money, but then another customer arrived, our work was done. He paid double amount. He was an honest man. We had golden jubilee. [Music] What is wrong, even whiskey is not picking up the phone, and Lafhrah has no phone, Hey Chanda, my heart is sinking. You come with me. Okay, I will go with you, Hey Pari, please call Zarka again. I am calling her. Hello Zarka, are you okay? Why were you not picking up the phone? Give it to me,  Zarka, it has been the whole night that we stayed awake. Please tell me what happened? Lafra and Whiskey did not reach there, you are coming with them? No, mother, I am not coming. Yes, Lafrah and Whiskey have left, Mother, nothing happened. I heard Shumail saying to Murad that he  divorce me, I got scared and called, but Murad did not divorce me, Mother, yesterday I became unwell, Murad took me to the hospital, do you know what happened there? Tell me quickly what happened? Tell me the truth.  My heart is sinking. I feel that you are lying, I am just coming to take you. Now I can't even go and you know mother, Murad has said that he will never divorce me, do you know why? Because I am, going to become a mother. Hey, what are you saying? Thank God! We were worried all night, you talk to Chanda. What happened? Hello ... Zarka Really? Allah bless you, congratulations! Mashallah! now you just take good care of yourself and switch off the phone, let me congratulate your mother, she was crying because of your problem, now she  crying after hearing your good news, Okay dear God bless you! Hope everything is good, what are you congratulating for? Hey, I have talked to Zarka, she is going to be a mother. Ah, congratulations, thanks to God. You were getting worried for no reason. You have made everyone, yourself, Murad and Zarka sad! I had said sorry to Murad. You said sorry to Murad, and you have spoiled Zarka's and your relations? Just imagine if she refuses to give her child to you? How can she do this? She can do everything to do so. It was a matter of understanding. If you end that understanding by fighting, then you can not take her child by force. That child is ours, how can we let her take? Give up your stubbornness and have good terms with her, if she leaves, you will not get the child, there is only one way to stop her, say sorry to her.  Keep good terms with her. Zarka, I am sorry. I just got angry. Sister, why are you talking like this and anyway, it was my fault. It was not your fault, nor did Murad anything wrong. Shumail should not have done this, but you did not talk to anyone in your house about this? I had called mother but later I told her what the doctor had said, Shumail sister I know such things makes angry, but now everything is over, isn't it? Please don't be worried. I am not worried and now there is nothing like this between us and now you have to be happy and I have to keep you happy, if you need anything then just tell me. You both have to live like a sister in the house till the child is born. I have also hired a maid and I will explain to her to take care of your food and drink. And if you feel like eating any special thing, then tell without any hesitation. I feel like eating curry since morning. Okay, I will get it made for you [Music] Murad Bhai, for a few days, we are related to you, and after all, I am also auntie of your child. Mother and I want to celebrate the happiness of Zarka. Can't we meet her? Who said that you guys can't meet? Of course you can meet, come in the evening. Okay? Thank you Murad Brother. We will come in the evening. You welcome! Pari had called, she wanted to meet, so I said, they all can come in the evening, You have taken permission from Shumail sister? Don't worry about it, Thank you Murad! It's okay [music]  Oh Allah, you have heard this prayer. Listen to me just one more time, don't let me go anywhere from here, never ever. Look Chanda, such precious things around, Zarka's destiny has opened. Seems all imported items. Hey, what are you doing, don't touch? I am just watching. The thing will break.
