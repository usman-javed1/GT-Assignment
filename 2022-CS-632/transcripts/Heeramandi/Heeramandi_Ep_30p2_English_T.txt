[34.44] Mother, I am a worm of filth and disgrace
[38.80] I have no right to live,
[46.60] why you give birth to me?
[55.04] If by mistake I was born,
[60.64] why didn't you kill me soon after the birth. No my child
[68.72] You should have thrown me in the garbage, I would have been taken away by stray dogs
[76.60] I wouldn’t have been called bastard
[91.36] I am your culprit
[94.56] I lied to Shehram
[101.88]  he asked me, so I told him
[109.12] you are a sex worker
[119.20] I lied
[122.16] that you are a sex worker
[153.04] Guddu
[157.16] Guddu
[166.77] [Music]
[174.20] Chanda ....
[180.13] [Music]
[188.52] I want to talk to you
[204.28] after me 
[208.76] How did you spend your life?
[218.40]  
[220.24] With the ....
[224.01] With the support of your son
[230.48] [Music] 
[240.20] What did you say?
[245.76] My son? Yes!
[257.08] I could not get anything else in that one night,
[263.20] but I definitely became the mother of your child,
[272.16] perhaps God knew that in the coming moments, I would not
[278.28] be able to bear being alone, that is why he
[285.44] What are you saying Chanda?
[292.52] Is this true? I wish it was a lie
[300.04] I wish the pain of that night had
[305.76] not made me mother.
[308.44] I would have left this world.
[314.96] At least I would not
[321.56] have to face the pain of illegal child
[327.00] A child who doesn't get his father's name
[334.24] so he doesn't accept his own name.
[343.56] Where is my son?
[351.60] What will you do after meeting him?
[361.04] A child born in such an environment can only be called Dirth
[365.84] he blamed me for keeping him alive
[372.68] He is saying right.
[377.08] Why did I give birth to him? Why didn't I kill him as soon as he was born?
[385.28] Why didn't I leave him in the garbage heap for dogs to eat?
[390.08] What kind of things are you talking about?
[394.16] I will give him my name after all he is my son.
[403.04] Chanda, forgive me,
[409.48] I thought that you ...
[417.00] please forgive me 
[427.04] You come with me, to my house
[431.96] No, courtesan has no home,
[438.72] the four walls in which they spend their life,
[442.60] people don't call it a home, it
[447.40] is called a brothel or roadside
[452.00] A place where people don’t care who they hurt as they go
[458.64] You will not stay here anymore; you will come with me to my house
[464.12] you will stay with me, we both will love our son,
[470.68] the love of parents!
[476.00] I can't go with you.
[484.64] Sir ...
[488.64] she will go with you, I am guilty,
[499.68] it is my fault
[503.28] I am your culprit, I have lied to you, I
[510.32] have lied, that she is a sex worker
[514.64] she is not a sex worker, she is innocent
[521.12] and Whisky 
[524.84] Guddu is your son
[538.07] [Music] 
[545.51] Whisky? Yes! .... My son?
[551.20] Yes sir, he is your son
[561.31] [Music] 
[573.64] Where is he?
[576.76] Call him. Sir, I don't know where he has gone. I will bring him to you.
[585.68] You take her sir, I will bring Guddu to your house, I promise!
[594.76]  
[597.24] Take her with you.
[603.12] I will not go anywhere,
[606.36] Why won't you go? All life you have been waiting for him
[612.56] She has been waiting for you all her life. Now when he is here then what happened to you?
[620.76] I will not go anywhere without Guddu, Guddu hasn’t gone anywhere. I will  bring
[628.92] him back to you. Chande,
[637.76] go with him, there is nothing for you here.
[644.48] Everything is over. It's the end of the story. Take her with you Sir.
[651.40] I beg in front of you, take her. Hey crazy, just go!
[660.52] Go from here. Everything is over Chande!
[671.65] [Music]
[697.79] [Music]
[706.26] [Music]
[747.72] Shehram, where were you? I have been calling you for so long, your phone was also switched off, I She was worried.
[759.24] Come Chanda.
[764.87] [Music]
[777.44] She will stay here from today onwards
[782.12] [Music]
[806.44] Mother ... Mother ...
[814.24] Mother ...
[819.32] Mother ...
[825.64] Mother ...
[828.72] Mother ...
[840.04] Mother ... Mother ...
[843.96] Mother ...
[856.52] Mother ...
[862.59]  
[866.22] Mother ...
[874.08] Who are you looking for Whiskey? Looking for your mother?
[878.36] She used to give decency lectures; she went with a man just a while ago
[885.88] she has found someone who will pay her price
[893.44] You tell lies, she was my mother, not a traitor.  
[899.64] Your mother, she was also a courtesan, today she finally went with a customer
[907.08] You are lying. Leave me
[913.04]  If I am lying, then go and ask father of yours, Lafra
[921.53] Lafrah ... Lafray ...
[937.78] Zaira ....
[941.04] Just open the door. I want to talk to you
[952.68] Zaira please, open the door let me talk to you
[974.68] The woman I have brought home is
[978.08] not the courtesan with whom I spent the night.
[984.04] I have brought that Chanda who is
[990.56] the mother of my son!
[996.72] and that child is not dead like Murad's child
[1002.44] he is alive. He was punished for my crimes and spent so many years living on a pile of filth
[1009.20]  
[1013.88] Apparently, there is no fault of that child. I told you
[1022.24] that a thorn hurts in my heart, maybe that was not my sub conscience,
[1032.80] it was the pain that God had created to give me this feeling.
[1044.66] I did not know that even a little
[1051.44] mistake of mine would give birth to this incident
[1058.64] no decent man who wants to entertain his heart, goes to the brothel
[1064.40] is unaware of the fact what he is going to lose, and
[1068.88] when he comes out after seducing a woman, he still does not know that he has
[1076.00] lost everything
[1079.89] It's been years
[1082.91] So many years have passed and now I know
[1092.76] That boy spent every moment of these years in misery.
[1098.76] He kept considering himself a worm in a dirty drain and an illegitimate child,
[1103.68] whereas he is not an illegitimate child, I am his illegitimate father. I am
[1112.52] the one who should have endured the tortures, but that poor child endured. 
[1118.44] You know who he is?
[1124.16] You don't know.
[1128.20] If you know, then maybe you will blame me more than that child and Chanda.
[1134.28] How many times did that child come in front of me and I could not recognize him,
[1139.68] He through my decency
[1144.92] in my face and
[1148.20] I could not recognize him
[1152.76] that he is my son, my own child!
[1158.64] The blood of this noble family. The same blood that is running in my veins,
[1164.44] is running in his veins also,
[1175.24] would you like to know who is he?
[1195.76] Whisky!
[1204.44] Whiskey, is my son.
[1210.41] [Music]
[1220.88] [Song]
[1231.80] [Song]
[1245.40] Hey, a dead body! I think he is dead.
[1253.61] [Music]
[1261.82] [Music]
[1267.82] [Music]
[1273.30] Where were you all night?
[1278.04] I have been waiting for you all night, I’ve been restless. Why are you not answering?
[1282.64] Where were you?
[1289.52] I took many wrong decisions in my life
[1295.04] one of them was to marry Zarka on your insistence,
[1299.88] but now I do not want to take any wrong decision, infact I want to
[1308.12] correct my decisions,
[1310.92] so, I have 
[1316.20]  got divorce papers ready! 
[1319.57] [Music]
[1326.02] I have come to know right and wrong
[1333.92] so, I have decided that
[1339.16] you will get the divorce papers tomorrow,
[1345.52] I can't live with you. What are you saying?
[1351.41] This is a home for both of us
[1367.60] Neither of us will leave from here.
[1385.26]  
[1395.64] Thank you!
