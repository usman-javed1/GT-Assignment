[0.24] Listen, you should go to school. Learn how to read and write, you will become a great man.
[7.48] What are you talking about? I am son of a courtesan , what else will I do? A frog's child
[12.64] will remain a frog, neither will he become a bird nor will he fly. Don't talk like this, you know your mother
[18.12] don't like this, then why you do this? Why she dislike this all? After all she is also a courtesan and Zeenat
[23.76] tell her clearly I will not go to school. I will learn dance and if she
[30.76] enrolled me in school, I swear to Allah I will run away from here. Vodka
[36.04] told me in Hyderabad that there are many courtesan, I will go to Hyderabad with Vodka,
[41.28] keep looking for me. Come here, who teaches you all these things?
[49.08] Vodka teaches you all these things? Listen Whiskey, you are still a child, your mother says right, people
[56.76] don't consider courtesan good. Don't lie, Zeenat, if people don't think courtesan  good, then
[62.16] why do they come here? You won't understand, it is the hypocrisy of the noble people,
[68.04] due to which we courtesans are alive, because of this hypocrisy is our livelihood.
[73.84] Okay, but if this is my livelihood too, then what is bothering mother? Because mother does
[80.36] not like that you bring customers. Now tell me, have you ever seen a customer in her room?
[86.16] No, never. I never brought for her, I
[91.36] brought for Chambeli, you get well, I will bring customer for you too. No Whisky,
[98.36] I don't want a customer anymore and one more thing, your mother is a very decent woman, 
[104.24] She is not a courtesan. It's her bad luck that she is born here.
[111.16] As you are born. Now promise me that you will not talk to your mother like this again.
[118.44] You like she cries and beat you and not sleep all night?
[124.24] No, I don't want her to cry but don't interfere in my matter
[130.63]  
[141.50]  
[161.92] Hey ... Vodka?
[169.00] Where has this fucker gone? What happened to me.
[175.96] I am going crazy. Vodka you know why I
[182.64] am going crazy? If you know that Zeenat is doing to die soon,
[187.76] then you will die yourself, you will go mad.
[204.84] [Music]
[217.55] Aunty, what happened aunty? Why are you crying?
[224.92] Sit ... Tell me what happened? Chanda ...
[231.60] if I don't tell, my heart will burst
[238.83]  My daughter is dying,
[243.48] what do you mean? Doctor said that Zeenat
[250.28] will not live long, she has AIDS. AIDS?
[257.24] so why didn't you tell me earlier? Is this something to hide?
[262.72] The doctor is lying, take me to her. I will talk to her.
[267.76] She is dying, Zeenat is dying,
[272.48] Chanda, the doctor says that it cannot be cure, if anything can be done with the treatment, then she
[280.56] can live for some more time, that's it. This treatment is very
[286.32] expensive, where can I get the treatment done, Chanda? She is dying.
[293.24] Don't worry about her treatment, I will get her treated. If you need money, I will collect the money.
[301.00] Hey, you say to Lafrah, bring me a customer, I will dance, I will do anything, I will save her,
[305.44] I know, she will not survive. Hey, aunty don't
[311.36] lose hope. My daughter is dying. No it's
[316.00] not like this 
[319.24] Seeing you after a long time? I have got a job. Be thankful to God.
[325.44] I also do my work. Phoolan, tell me one thing. Yes ask.
[334.76] Customers buy paan from you or Lafrah and Vodka? Sometimes customers
[342.00] buys himself and sometimes lafrah and Vodka convinces them
[348.12] and charge extra money from them and gives me work.
[351.76] Who buys flower bangle? Customer himself buys, but what is your problem?
[360.96] I will tell you later. Well, tell me, for how much do you sell flower bangle?
[368.28] These rich people gives the money according to demand and these poor
[374.64] pays a little. Okay, now the last question is
[381.64] that you would be selling a lot, and earning a lot? Why don't you
[386.36] come as customer? I will also get income and you will also enjoy?
[390.80] You are trapping me? Go from here. I become your customer. Today is my unlucky day. Vodka went 
[401.48] to bring customers but did not take me with him and you are not ready to come.
[406.00] Hey Phoolan
[409.88] customer came itself. I am coming in a short while. 
[421.48] Sir?
[425.00] Sir?
[428.44] Sir?
[431.52] Sir, there is a lot of good stuff here. Pay me as much money as you want, just
[438.68] give me my commission first. These bitches cheats, although they are amazing, big intoxicating
[445.84] eyes, long hair, they dances like that they make you dance along.
[452.88] You will be happy
[456.12] Sir?
[460.40] Sir, have you ever seen fairies?
[466.96] I will show you fairies. They lives here,
[474.68] Hello Sir, you took a long time in coming,
[480.48] I have been waiting for you for so long. I have brought this customer. You 
[487.68] bought for me. I brought for my mother
[493.80] What?
[500.04] For your mother? Sir, a courtesan child, what else will do? A frog's child
[506.64] remain a frog or will it become a bird and fly away? Courtesan is not anyone's wife, daughter or
[512.04] mother. She is only a courtesan. Please ignore her. She is very clever.
[519.08] Sir, you look at my mother, sir, you
[524.96] will keep starring at her. Sir, stop sir, if you don't like, return the money. Stop sir.
[530.08] No sir, sir, stop, sir, sir, sir, stop, no, sir,
[541.52] You are right, Whiskey, no one leaves from here like this,
[548.36] You just wait and see if any customer come, I will send him back. Why?
[555.44] Because you kicked my customer.
[562.46]  
[573.12] I have brought this customer for my mother. Sir, a courtesan child, what else will do? A frog's child
[579.20] will remain a frog, it will not become a bird and fly? Anyway, a courtesan is not anyone's
[584.60] wife, daughter, mother. She is not only a courtesan.
[601.72] [Music] 
[613.16] [Music]
[618.58]  
[630.57] Asalam alaikum sir. Walikum asalam
[638.76] How are you? I am good. Have you seen fairy?
[645.72] Long hair, beautiful eyes and lips like rose petals
[653.08] What are you saying?
[656.80] Go, don't talk nonsense. It's not nosense. Heaven is in this world.
[663.60] I will only take Rs 100 commission. If you didn't  like, I will return the money. How much is your commission? 100
[671.00] keep Rs 100 and go from here.
[682.84] I don't take money without my services.
[694.16] Sometimes it's no harm in taking money without services. 
[699.72] I was thinking that you have not come yet, I don't know whether you will come or
[705.36] not. How is Zahrah? She is not well.  Sleeping right now.
[712.92] No idea what kind of disease she have. Still not cure.
[717.88]  I have not yet told her that you are coming,
[722.84] she had refused, but how could I not tell you, son. You have done well Auntie.
[731.60] Take a bath and get freshen up, she is sleeping, as she wakes up, I
[736.92] will tell her. She is in her room? Yes in her room.
[742.84] We cannot send her home, she will have to be admitted, the condition of the patient
[749.60] is very bad, you people are very stubborn, you people neither take her home nor
[754.72] give her proper treatment nor do you take precautions. Dr, person dies in AIDS?
[761.96] Do you know what is AIDS? Immunity collapse in this disease and any germ
[770.14] can attack. Patient never gets better. Zeenat has Jaundice now,
[781.36] so you leave her here, at least she can get proper treatment. Rest 
[787.64] life and Death is in the hands of God, who knows maybe she recovers.
[813.65] [Music]
[835.52]  
[844.56]  [Music]
[856.04] She is so weak. Because she doesn't take care of herself, live days
[863.96] without eating. She is taking medicine? Sometime she takes.
[869.08] if I say so. She haven't even gone to the doctor for so many days,
[878.00] It must be Zahid, I will see.
[893.84] What are you doing here? I am making my hair. You are
[900.16] becoming a hero. Oh you think that only you are hero here Prince? You want corn?
[907.96] No, I have just eaten halwa puri. By the way, let me tell you one thing, 
[914.76] Zeenat will not survive. What are you saying? Why you threw my corn? Don't you feel ashamed,
[920.36] keep talking nonsense. It's not nonsense, I know. Last night Husna Auntie
[926.00] was saying to my mother, Zeenat will not survive, doctor also said she is going to die, on this my
[930.92] mother had said that I will do business, bring me a customer. I brought a customer and she started beating me,
[938.00] where are you going, Vodka?
