[19.08] You were saying that it is a little burnt, this is a deep burn
[26.80] Shumail, give me first aid box. 
[39.96] Is it hurting?
[44.12] It was not so painful at the time of the burn.
[49.76] It's worse now. I am angry at you.
[56.16] Zarka, what was the need to go in the kitchen?
[59.84] Take care now, okay?
[65.41] Thank you, Shumail. You sent the servants out of the house.
[70.24] Hire some new servants.
[72.00] How will you manage the house and the kitchen and everything?
[76.00] Let me look into. We have to do it ourselves.
[81.13] There is no pain killer in here. I will bring it.
[89.26] Show me.
[95.68] It won't hurt. Relax.
[107.50] I like that car very much, okay, I will talk later.
[115.55] Hey Whiskey, I have to go to the market. So go.
[120.49] Why are you bothering me? Come on, let's go together. I'll ride in your rickshaw.
[126.41] I will pay you money for it. I don't need your money.
[130.97] Leave it! I'm cleaning it with so much effort. Just go away.
[135.76] Get lost from here.
[137.80] Are you still in the same mood?
[139.91] You're crazy. I'm telling you, my mind is all twisted right now.
[143.40] Just get out of here.
[145.48] If you're not worried because of Zarka, then don't take tension about her.
[149.38] She called, and sheâ€™s very happy.
[151.80] Oh, she told both mother and me not to come.
[154.80] And when we don't have any problem, what's the issue with you?
[158.59] Look, I'm happy, mother is happy. Zarka is happy. To hell with your happiness.
[164.61] I will not rest in peace, I will take revenge from them. Okay, take your revenge,
[171.00] you may get cold. Right now, take me to the market. I also told mother that I
[175.56] will go to the market with Whiskey. Let's go now.
[180.92] I will make you some nice strong tea. Come on, hurry up now,
[185.96] Hey, let's go, now market closes early. 
[197.32] By the way, you took Rani and didn't even ask us for tea? Well, you
[204.20] will remember today's tea from my side. By the way, the rickshaw is shining from my side,
[213.60] Murad. Yes. Come, Shami kebab is of your choice and Zarka has prepared
[222.14] Sit ... Just one
[236.96] Just one, where are you going? I won't
[243.20] eat anything, I will just drink tea. Okay, please make it for Murad too. Okay,
[247.20]  
[254.48] How much sugar? One spoon.
[263.68] see what Murad has brought for both of us,
[268.08] this is for you and
[272.40] For me? How is it?
[278.44] Thank you!
[282.56] I am telling the truth mother, honestly, I am not lying, yes, Shumail sister
[290.80] has given me a dress and that dress was brought by Murad, he himself select for both of us.
[296.56] Yes mother, and today we sat together and had tea
[301.18] I don't know what has happened to Shumail sister, she
[306.28] has completely changed
[312.52] Mother, don't start crying, just pray that everything will be fine,
[318.80] I told you, everything is getting fine. You know Murad, you have started talking to me
[326.72] and I used to feel a strange fear from Shumail sister, now I don't even feel that fear. Today
[331.28] she called me and asked me whether I know how to make kebabs, then I said
[335.64] that my mother taught me, she said make kebabs, Murad likes it very much, Murad is very
[342.88] fond of it . Even when he ate it, they liked it very much.
[348.28] Okay mother, I will talk to you later
[370.56] Hey, what happened? Tell me,
[375.00] Why are you crying? It's difficult to judge whether you are laughing or crying,
[378.88] Tell me. I got a call from Zarka and she is very happy. I told you that you were getting
[388.40] worried for no use. In this world, only what God wants that happens, what
[393.48] a person wants cannot happen, that is why I told you to ask from God. Don't keep hopes from humans.
[400.24] You are right, it had happened like this before also, I had cried a lot but now look at Zarka,
[409.36] how happy she is. Now be thankful to God,
[413.84] Yes, I will offer prayer, just to show my gratitude,
[420.64] Crazy girl, you are getting worried for no reason. 
[427.08] Crazy girl. Let's go !
[448.12] Hey sister, you could have told me, I can make tea
[452.84] I am making coffee. Sister, I know how to make coffee. Seems, you
[459.64] know all the work. Yes sister, mother has taught me and my sister Pari all the work. I
[465.44] also know how to sew clothes. Okay, then I will get a dress stitched from you.
[471.12]  Sure sister, I will stitch a good dress for you. Okay, take this. Murad is upstairs
[477.72] in lounge, give him coffee. Me?
[483.40] No, you give him by yourself. Why won't you go? Why are you afraid
[492.16] of Murad? He is your husband, you have right on him. Come on, hold it, go,
[499.32] give him.
[503.24] Come on!
[508.44] come on, take it.

[549.28] Where is Shumail? Tell her to bring the coffee. She made this coffee. She said,
[558.00] I should serve you. How much sugar? Two spoons.
[566.72] You took one spoon of sugar in the morning tea and
[575.28] two spoons of sugar in the coffee. Sugar requirement doubles at night?
[582.44] Coffee is bitter, that's why. Oh, I had forgotten.

[784.32] are at home, don't open the door no matter who comes, when we come back, we will call
[788.16] on your mobile then open the door. Can I also come? What will you do?

[831.76] I should inform mother. No ... Not mother
[840.24] This is definitely Whisky's work.
[847.12] I am fine where are you? Why are you asking? You tell me
[855.16] where are you? I am taking a passenger. You went to Zaira aunty's house?
[862.12] Why would I go to their house?
[866.36] I am not related to them and Pari did'nt told you, her husband hit me. She
[871.00] had told me, that is why I am asking, have you stabbed him? Have you gone mad?
[878.12] Listen, the policeman is standing in front. He will issue the challan, after dropping passenger I will call you back.
[882.64] Whiskey .... Hello ....
[899.05] [music]
[907.48] I don't think, the police will do something because till now these people are
[912.24] not able to understand who killed. Maybe they were dacoits, these days people get robbed on the way,
[918.76] Yes, but they did not rob him.
[925.00] I go to the hospital then will get some updates. In Karachi, street crimes are common and
[930.16] even they kill too. Thank God he is safe.
[937.16] I am going. No, drink the juice and listen update me also when you reach there.
[943.22]  
[946.76] Asalam alikum aunty,
[952.76] He is feeling better now? Thank God!
[959.24] Okay, I will visit before going to office. Okay Allah Hafiz. What happened?
[965.44] He is back home. Then I will also come with.  Sister can I come too?
[974.72] No, what you will do.
