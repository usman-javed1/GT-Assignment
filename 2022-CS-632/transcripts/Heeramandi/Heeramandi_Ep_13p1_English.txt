Listen, you should go to school. Learn how to read and write, you will become a great man. What are you talking about? I am son of a courtesan , what else will I do? A frog's child will remain a frog, neither will he become a bird nor will he fly. Don't talk like this, you know your mother don't like this, then why you do this? Why she dislike this all? After all she is also a courtesan and Zeenat tell her clearly I will not go to school. I will learn dance and if she enrolled me in school, I swear to Allah I will run away from here. Vodka told me in Hyderabad that there are many courtesan, I will go to Hyderabad with Vodka, keep looking for me. Come here, who teaches you all these things? Vodka teaches you all these things? Listen Whiskey, you are still a child, your mother says right, people don't consider courtesan good. Don't lie, Zeenat, if people don't think courtesan  good, then why do they come here? You won't understand, it is the hypocrisy of the noble people, due to which we courtesans are alive, because of this hypocrisy is our livelihood. Okay, but if this is my livelihood too, then what is bothering mother? Because mother does not like that you bring customers. Now tell me, have you ever seen a customer in her room? No, never. I never brought for her, I brought for Chambeli, you get well, I will bring customer for you too. No Whisky, I don't want a customer anymore and one more thing, your mother is a very decent woman,  She is not a courtesan. It's her bad luck that she is born here. As you are born. Now promise me that you will not talk to your mother like this again. You like she cries and beat you and not sleep all night? No, I don't want her to cry but don't interfere in my matter     Hey ... Vodka? Where has this fucker gone? What happened to me. I am going crazy. Vodka you know why I am going crazy? If you know that Zeenat is doing to die soon, then you will die yourself, you will go mad. [Music] Aunty, what happened aunty? Why are you crying? Sit ... Tell me what happened? Chanda ... if I don't tell, my heart will burst  My daughter is dying, what do you mean? Doctor said that Zeenat will not live long, she has AIDS. AIDS? so why didn't you tell me earlier? Is this something to hide? The doctor is lying, take me to her. I will talk to her. She is dying, Zeenat is dying, Chanda, the doctor says that it cannot be cure, if anything can be done with the treatment, then she can live for some more time, that's it. This treatment is very expensive, where can I get the treatment done, Chanda? She is dying. Don't worry about her treatment, I will get her treated. If you need money, I will collect the money. Hey, you say to Lafrah, bring me a customer, I will dance, I will do anything, I will save her, I know, she will not survive. Hey, aunty don't lose hope. My daughter is dying. No it's not like this  Seeing you after a long time? I have got a job. Be thankful to God. I also do my work. Phoolan, tell me one thing. Yes ask. Customers buy paan from you or Lafrah and Vodka? Sometimes customers buys himself and sometimes lafrah and Vodka convinces them and charge extra money from them and gives me work. Who buys flower bangle? Customer himself buys, but what is your problem? I will tell you later. Well, tell me, for how much do you sell flower bangle? These rich people gives the money according to demand and these poor pays a little. Okay, now the last question is that you would be selling a lot, and earning a lot? Why don't you come as customer? I will also get income and you will also enjoy? You are trapping me? Go from here. I become your customer. Today is my unlucky day. Vodka went  to bring customers but did not take me with him and you are not ready to come. Hey Phoolan customer came itself. I am coming in a short while.  Sir? Sir? Sir? Sir, there is a lot of good stuff here. Pay me as much money as you want, just give me my commission first. These bitches cheats, although they are amazing, big intoxicating eyes, long hair, they dances like that they make you dance along. You will be happy Sir? Sir, have you ever seen fairies? I will show you fairies. They lives here, Hello Sir, you took a long time in coming, I have been waiting for you for so long. I have brought this customer. You  bought for me. I brought for my mother What? For your mother? Sir, a courtesan child, what else will do? A frog's child remain a frog or will it become a bird and fly away? Courtesan is not anyone's wife, daughter or mother. She is only a courtesan. Please ignore her. She is very clever. Sir, you look at my mother, sir, you will keep starring at her. Sir, stop sir, if you don't like, return the money. Stop sir. No sir, sir, stop, sir, sir, sir, stop, no, sir, You are right, Whiskey, no one leaves from here like this, You just wait and see if any customer come, I will send him back. Why? Because you kicked my customer.   I have brought this customer for my mother. Sir, a courtesan child, what else will do? A frog's child will remain a frog, it will not become a bird and fly? Anyway, a courtesan is not anyone's wife, daughter, mother. She is not only a courtesan. [Music]  [Music]   Asalam alaikum sir. Walikum asalam How are you? I am good. Have you seen fairy? Long hair, beautiful eyes and lips like rose petals What are you saying? Go, don't talk nonsense. It's not nosense. Heaven is in this world. I will only take Rs 100 commission. If you didn't  like, I will return the money. How much is your commission? 100 keep Rs 100 and go from here. I don't take money without my services. Sometimes it's no harm in taking money without services.  I was thinking that you have not come yet, I don't know whether you will come or not. How is Zahrah? She is not well.  Sleeping right now. No idea what kind of disease she have. Still not cure.  I have not yet told her that you are coming, she had refused, but how could I not tell you, son. You have done well Auntie. Take a bath and get freshen up, she is sleeping, as she wakes up, I will tell her. She is in her room? Yes in her room. We cannot send her home, she will have to be admitted, the condition of the patient is very bad, you people are very stubborn, you people neither take her home nor give her proper treatment nor do you take precautions. Dr, person dies in AIDS? Do you know what is AIDS? Immunity collapse in this disease and any germ can attack. Patient never gets better. Zeenat has Jaundice now, so you leave her here, at least she can get proper treatment. Rest  life and Death is in the hands of God, who knows maybe she recovers. [Music]    [Music] She is so weak. Because she doesn't take care of herself, live days without eating. She is taking medicine? Sometime she takes. if I say so. She haven't even gone to the doctor for so many days, It must be Zahid, I will see. What are you doing here? I am making my hair. You are becoming a hero. Oh you think that only you are hero here Prince? You want corn? No, I have just eaten halwa puri. By the way, let me tell you one thing,  Zeenat will not survive. What are you saying? Why you threw my corn? Don't you feel ashamed, keep talking nonsense. It's not nonsense, I know. Last night Husna Auntie was saying to my mother, Zeenat will not survive, doctor also said she is going to die, on this my mother had said that I will do business, bring me a customer. I brought a customer and she started beating me, where are you going, Vodka?
